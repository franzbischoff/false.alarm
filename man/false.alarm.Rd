\title{Matrix Profile for R}
\description{
This package is derived from the former package \code{tsmp}. It is intended to make a clear separation of what is the
Matrix Profile computation and what are the data mining process we can do using Matrix Profile.
}
\details{
The Matrix Profile, has the potential to revolutionize time series data mining because of its generality,
versatility, simplicity and scalability. In particular it has implications for time series motif discovery, time
series joins, shapelet discovery (classification), density estimation, semantic segmentation, visualization, rule
discovery, clustering etc.
}
\section{Parallel backend}{
This package uses RcppParallel in order to do multithreading computations. By default it uses the 'TBB' backend.
If por any reason you want to change the backend to 'tinythread', you may use:
\code{Sys.setenv(RCPP_PARALLEL_BACKEND = "tinythread")}. To configure back to 'TBB', use
\code{Sys.setenv(RCPP_PARALLEL_BACKEND = "tbb")}.
