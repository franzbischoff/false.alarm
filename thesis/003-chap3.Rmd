# Tables, Graphics, References, and Labels {#ref-labels}

## Tables

In addition to the tables that can be automatically generated from a data frame in **R** that you saw in [R Markdown
Basics] using the `kable` function, you can also create tables using *pandoc*. (More information is available at
<http://pandoc.org/README.html#tables>.) This might be useful if you don't have values specifically stored in **R**, but
you'd like to display them in table form. Below is an example. Pay careful attention to the alignment in the table and
hyphens to create the rows and columns.

W can also create a link to the table by doing t
e following: Table \@ref(tab:inher).   you go back to [Loading and e
p oring data] and look at the `kable` table, we c
n create a reference to this max delays table too: Table \ref(tab:maxdelays). The addition of the `(\#tab:inher)` option to the end of the table caption allows us to then make a
reference to Table `\@ref(tab:label)`. Note that this reference could appear anywhere throughout the document after t
e e
ble has appeared.  !-- We will next explore ways to create this label-ref link using figures. -->

\`\`\`\Figures

If your thesis has a lot of figures, _R\*Markdown_ \_* ht behave better for you than that other word processor.  e perk i
i at it will automatically number the figures accordingly in each chapter.  'll also be able to create a label for ea
h figure, add a caption, and then reference the figure in a way similar to what we saw with tables earlier.   you la
e  y
ur figures, you can move the figures around and _R\ *arkdown_ \w*ll automatically adjust the numbering for you.   ne
d d
r you to remember!   that you don't have to get too far into LaTeX to do this, a couple **R** functions have be

eated for you to assist.  u'll see their use below.

| e thing that may be annoying is the way _R*Markdown_ *andles "floats" like tables and figures (it's really \LaTeX's fault). \LaTeX\  ll try to find the best place to put your object based on the text around it and until you're really, truly done writing you should just leave it where it lies. There are some optional arguments specified in the options parameter of the `label` function.  f you need to shift your figure around, it might be good to look here on tweaking the options argument:  https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Floats,_Figures_and_Captions>

 |If you need a graphic or tabular material to be part of the text, you can just put it inline. If you need it to appear i
 the list of figures or tables, it should be placed in a code chunk.

\
I`I\`\th **R** chunk below, we will load in a picture stored as `red.jpg` i\n our main directory.  Wthen give it the ca
tion of "Reed logo", the label of "reedlogo", and specify that this is a figure.  Me note of the different **R** ch
nk op
ions that are given in the R Markdown file (not shown in the knitted document).

```{r reedlogo, eval = FALSE, fig.cap="Reed logo"}
include_graphics(path = "figure/reed.jpg")
```

Here is a reference to the Reed logo: Figure \@ref(fig:reedlogo).  Ne the use of the `fig:` code here.  Bnaming the **
nk that contains the figure, we can then reference that figure later as done in the first sentence here.  Wcan al
o  o
cify the caption for the figure via the R chunk option `fig.cap`.

\clearpage 

-- starts a new page and stops trying to place floats such as tables and figures -->

\Below we will investigate how to save the output of an **R** plot and label it in a way similar to that done above.  Rall the `flights` dataset from Chapter \@ref(rmd-basics).  (te that we've shown a different way to reference a se
ti n or
chapter here.)  Wwill next explore a bar graph with the mean flight departure delays by airline from Po
tl nd for 20
4.  Ne also the use of the `scale` parameter which is discussed on the next page.

```{r delaysboxplot, warnings=FALSE, messages=FALSE, fig.cap="Mean Delays by Airline", fig.width=6}
flights %>%
  group_by(carrier) %>%
  summarize(mean_dep_delay = mean(dep_delay)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = carrier, y = mean_dep_delay)) +
  geom_bar(position = "identity", stat = "identity", fill = "red")
```

Here is a reference to this image: Figure \@ref(fig:delaysboxplot).

A table linking these carrier codes to airline names is available at <h
\tps://github.com/ismayc/pnwflights14/blob/master/data/airlines.csv>.
\
\clearpage

Next, we will explore the use of the `out.extra` chunk option, which can be used to shrink or expand an image loaded fr
m a file by specifying `"scale= "`. Here we use the mathematical graph stored in the "subdivision.pdf" file.

```{r subd, eval = FALSE, results="asis", echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Subdiv. graph", out.extra="scale=0.75"}
include_graphics("figure/subdivision.pdf")
```

Here is a reference to this image: Figure \@ref(fig:subd).  Ne that `echo=FALSE` is specified so that the **R** code is hi
de  in the document.

**More Figure Stuff**

Lastly, we will explore how to rotate and enlarge figures using the `out.extra` chunk option.  (rrently this only works in
th  PDF version of the book.)

```{r subd2, eval = FALSE, results="asis", echo=FALSE, out.extra="angle=180, scale=1.1", fig.cap="A Larger Figure, Flipped Upside Down"}
include_graphics("figure/subdivision.pdf")
```

As another example, here is a reference: Figure \@ref(fig:subd2).

\ootnotes and Endnotes

You might want to footnote something. ^[f[^1he footnote will be in a smaller font and placed appropriately. Endnotes wo
k in much the same way. More information can be found about both on the CUS site or feel free to reach out to <d
\[a@re\\ed.edu>.
\](ailto:data@reed.edu){.email}## \#\ibliographies

Of course you will need to cite things, and you will probably accumulate an armful of sources. There are a variety of to
ls available for creating a bibliography database (stored with the .bib extension).  Iaddition to BibTeX suggested be
ow, you may want to consider using the free and easy-to-use tool called Zotero.  T Reed librarians have created Zo
er  do
umentation at <http://libguides.reed.edu/citation/zotero>.  Iaddition, a tutorial is available from Mi
dl bury Co
lege at <http://sites.middlebury.edu/zoteromiddlebury/>.

_R \*arkdown_ u\*es _pa\*doc_ (\*htt<p://pandoc.org/>) t\>o build its bibliographies.  O nice caveat of this is that you wo
't ha
e  o do a second compile to load in references as standard LaTeX requires. To cite references in your thesis (a
ter cr
at ng your bibliography database), place the reference name inside square brackets and precede it by the "at" sy
bol.  F
Femple, here's a reference to a book about worrying:  [olina1994].  Ts `Molina1994` entry appears in a file ca

ed `thesis.bib` in the `bib` folder.  Ts bibliography database file was created by a program called BibTeX.  Y can ca

th s file something else if you like (look at the YAML header in the main .Rmd file) and, by default, is to placed in
t
e  bib` folder.  
 more information about BibTeX and bibliographies, see our CUS site (<ht\
p://web.reed.edu/cis/help/latex/index.html>)^\[@re[^2ere are three pages on this topic:  _b\b*x_ (\wh*ch talks about us

Bi TeX, at <http://web.reed.edu/cis/help/latex/bibtex.html>), _bi\bte*styles_ (\abo*t how to find and use the bibli
graphy style that best suits your needs, at <http://web.reed.edu/cis/help/latex/bibtexstyles.html>) and _bi\bma*_ (\whi*
 coers how to make and maintain a bibliography by hand, without BibTeX, at <ht\tp
 //eb.reed.edu/cis/help/latex/bibman.html>).\ The last page will not be useful unless you have only a few sources.

If you look at the YAML header at the top of the main .Rmd file you can see that we can specify the style of the bibli
graphy by referencing the appropriate csl file.  Yu an download a variety of different style files at <ht\tp

**Tips for Bibliographies**
