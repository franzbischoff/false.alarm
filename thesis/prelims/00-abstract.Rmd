## Abstract {.unnumbered}

Currently, Point-of-Care (POC) ECG monitoring works either as plot devices or alarms for abnormal cardiac rhythms using
predefined normal trigger ranges and some rhythm analysis, which raises the problem of false alarms. In comparison,
complex 12-derivation ECG machines are not suitable to use as simple monitors and are used with strict techniques for
formal diagnostics. We aim to identify, on streaming data, life-threatening hearth electric patterns to reduce the
number of false alarms, using low CPU and memory maintaining robustness. The study design is comparable to a diagnostic
study, where high accuracy is essential. Physionet's 2015 challenge yielded very good algorithms for reducing false
alarms. However, none of the authors reported benchmarks, memory usage, robustness test, or context invariance that
could assure its implementation on real monitors to reduce alarm fatigue indeed. We expect to identify the obstacles of
detecting life-threatening ECG changes within memory, space, and CPU constraints and to reduce ECG monitor's false
alarms using the proposed methodology, and assess the feasibility of implementing the algorithm in the real world and
other settings than ICU monitors.
