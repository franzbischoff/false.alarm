This is for including Chapter 1. Notice that it's also good practice to name your chunk. This will
help you debug potential issues as you knit. The chunk above is called intro and the one below is

# Scientific outcomes

This research has already yielded two R packages concerning the MP algorithms from UCR [@mpucr]. The
first package is called `tsmp`, and a paper has also been published in the R Journal [@RJ-2020-021]
(Journal Impact Factorâ„¢, 2020 of 3.984). The second package is called `matrixprofiler` and enhances
the first one, using low-level language to improve computational speed. The author has also joined
the Matrix Profile Foundation as co-founder together with contributors from Python and Go languages
[@mpf2020; @VanBenschoten2020]. The benchmarks of the R implementation are available online
[@Bischoff2021a].

Additionally to the above publication and the publication of the ongoing literature survey it is planned
to be published two articles about this thesis subject. The first regarding the application of the
FLOSS algorithm on real-time ECG showing its potential on using it on low-power devices. The second
regarding the use of combined shapelets for relevant ECG patterns identification.
