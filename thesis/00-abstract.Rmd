Currently, Point-of-Care (POC) ECG monitoring works either as plot devices or alarms for abnormal cardiac rhythms using predefined normal trigger ranges. On the other hand, full 12-derivation ECG machines are complex to use as simple monitors and are used with strict techniques for formal diagnostics of hearth electric conduction pathologies, and the automatic diagnostics are derived from a full analysis of the 12-dimension data after it is fully collected. Both systems do not handle disconnected leads and patient's motions, being strictly necessary to have a good and stable signal to allow proper diagnosis.

This research aims to identify abnormal hearth electric patterns using streaming data, specifically those who are life-threatening, being a reliable signal for Intensive Care Units to respond quickly to those situations.

The study design is comparable to a Diagnostic study, where high accuracy is essential. It will use the Physionet datasets, and the algorithm will try to minimize the false negatives and false positives. 

The expected result is the concretization of a new method that, besides being accurate, accomplishes this task using state of the art technology for time series analysis that allows minimum space and processor power to solve this problem. Also, we expect that fading factors can contribute to the state of the art of this technology.

The research team is well experienced in time-series and has studied the Matrix Profile since its beginning, being founders of the Matrix Profile Foundation whose goal is to have a concise and stable cross-language API for developing with the Matrix Profile technology.[@Bischoff2019a; @VanBenschoten2020]
