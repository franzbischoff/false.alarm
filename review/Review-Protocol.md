# Review title and timescale

## Review title

## Background / Rationale

Currently, Point-of-Care (POC) ECG monitoring works either as plot
devices or alarms for abnormal cardiac rhythms using predefined normal
trigger ranges. On the other hand, full 12-derivation ECG machines are
complex to use as simple monitors and are used with strict techniques
for formal diagnostics of hearth electric conduction pathologies, and
the automatic diagnostics are derived from a full analysis of the
12-dimension data after it is fully collected. Both systems do not
handle disconnected leads and patient’s motions, being strictly
necessary to have a good and stable signal to allow proper diagnosis. In
CinC/Physionet Challenge 2015, it has been reported that up to 86%
resulting of the alarms are false and this can lead to decreased staff
attention and increase in patients delirium.<sup>1–3</sup>

This research aims to identify abnormal hearth electric patterns using
streaming data, specifically those who are life-threatening, being a
reliable signal for Intensive Care Units to respond quickly to those
situations.

The study design is comparable to a Diagnostic study, where high
accuracy is essential. It will use the Physionet datasets, and the
algorithm will try to minimize the false negatives and false positives.

The expected result is the concretization of a new method that, besides
being accurate, accomplishes this task using state of the art technology
for time series analysis that allows minimum space and processor power
to solve this problem. Also, we expect that fading factors can
contribute to the state of the art of this technology.

The research team is well experienced in time-series and has studied the
Matrix Profile since its beginning, being founders of the Matrix Profile
Foundation whose goal is to have a concise and stable cross-language API
for developing with the Matrix Profile technology.<sup>4,5</sup>

## Searches

Give details of the sources to be searched, and any restrictions
(e.g. language or publication period). The full search strategy is not
required, but may be supplied as a link or attachment.

Search strings were developed for the following databases, and databases
were searched from their inception date until Month day year: Medline
(Pubmed), Scopus, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore and ACM Digital Library.

Suggested search expression:

(“artificial intelligence” OR “machine learning” OR “deep learning” OR
“natural language processing” OR “text mining” OR “text
classification” OR “automated coding” OR “auto-coding” OR “algorithmic
approaches” OR “automatic encoding” OR “automatic coding” OR “automatic
assignment” OR “diagnosis code assignment” OR “clinical coding” OR
“hospital information system”) AND (“ICD-9\*” OR “ICD-10\*” OR
“ICD10\*” OR “ICD9\*” OR “international classification of diseases”)

Grey literature search would be also interesting to be addressed

## URL to search strategy

Alternatively you can e-mail this to Prospero and we will store and link
to it.

I give permission for this file to be made publicly available

Give a short description of the disease, condition or healthcare domain
being studied. This could include health and wellbeing outcomes.

Methods for clinical coding automation using Artificial Intelligence

## Participants/population

Give summary criteria for the participants or populations being studied
by the review. The preferred format includes details of both inclusion
and exclusion criteria.

Health care services and systems

## Intervention(s), exposure(s)

Where relevant, give details of the alternatives against which the main
subject/topic of the review will be compared (e.g. another intervention
or a non-exposed control group).

## Types of study to be included

Give details of the study designs to be included in the review. If there
are no restrictions on the types of study design eligible for inclusion,
this should be stated.

artificial intelligence methodologies.

## Context

Give summary details of the setting and other relevant characteristics
which help define the inclusion or exclusion criteria.

Hospitals and National Health Systems

## Main outcome(s)

Give the most important outcomes.

Implemented AI methodologies

## Additional outcome(s)

List any additional outcomes that will be addressed. If there are no
secondary outcomes enter None.

Strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats related to the
implementation of the automation system.

## Data extraction (selection and coding)

Give the procedure for selecting studies for the review and extracting
data, including the number of researchers involved and how discrepancies
will be resolved. List the data to be extracted.

Studies will be selected by at least two authors independently by
screening titles and abstracts in endnote bibliographic management
program. The selected studies will be subject to full text screening by
applying the selection criteria. Reasons for exclusion will be
documented. Reference lists of the included studies will be hand
screened for potential studies. Any discrepancies between authors will
be adjudicated by a third author.

Two or more authors will independently extract the following data: study
design, study population, methodologies and approaches, outcome
measures. Where possible or applicable, missing values (e.g. standard
deviation) will be calculated from the available data (p-values,
t-values, confidence intervals or standard errors). Study authors may be
contacted to obtain important missing data.

## Risk of bias (quality) assessment

State whether and how risk of bias will be assessed, how the quality of
individual studies will be assessed, and whether and how this will
influence the planned synthesis.

XXXXXXXXX

## Strategy for data synthesis

Give the planned general approach to be used, for example whether the
data to be used will be aggregate or at the level of individual
participants, and whether a quantitative or narrative (descriptive)
synthesis is planned. Where appropriate a brief outline of analytic
approach should be given.

Standardized response We will use (insert choice i.e. Review Manager 5)
for data analysis, data synthesis and creating forest plots. We will
report continuous outcomes as standardized mean differences (SMD) with
95% CIs using different scales. Dichotomous outcomes will be reported as
Risk Ratios (RR) with 95% CIs. This may require specification by the ESR
or KSU lead based on the findings and the question.

Heterogeneity will be assessed by visual inspection of the forest plot,
by using the Chi²-test (significant if p \< 0.10) and the I² statistic
(heterogeneity considered significant if I² \> 60%). In case of
heterogeneity, meta-analysis might not be carried out. If two or more
studies of similar design on the same intervention and assessing the
same outcome and sufficient data are available, meta-analyses will be
performed. Since we anticipate variation between studies, meta-analysis
will be carried out using the random effects model. The Mantel-Haenszel
method will be used for dichotomous outcomes and the Inverse Variance
method will be used for continuous outcomes. A p-value \< 0.05 will be
considered significant. This may require specification by the
supervisors lead based on the findings and the question.

## Analysis of subgroups or subsets

Give any planned exploration of subgroups or subsets within the review.
‘None planned’ is a valid response if no subgroup analyses are
planned.

Categorization of methods or approaches to be defined by the research
leader
