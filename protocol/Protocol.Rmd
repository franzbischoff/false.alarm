# Abstract or Summary (in Portuguese and English)

*Atualmente, o monitoramento de ECG junto ao doente (point-of-care) funciona com dispositivos que apenas mostram
informação ou disparam alarmes para ritmos cardíacos anormais, usando intervalos normais predefinidos como gatilho. Por
outro lado, máquinas completas de ECG de 12 derivações são muito complexas para serem usadas como monitores simples e
são usadas com técnicas estritas para o diagnóstico formal de patologias da condução elétrica cardíaca, e o diagnóstico
automático é derivado de uma análise completa dos dados das 12 dimensões após totalmente coletados. Ambos os sistemas
não funcionam com linhas desconectadas e movimentos do paciente, sendo estritamente necessário ter um sinal bom e
estável para permitir o diagnóstico adequado.*

*Esta investigação tem como objetivo identificar padrões elétricos cardíacos anormais usando dados em tempo real,
especificamente aqueles padrões que implicam risco de vida, e fornecer um sinal confiável para que as Unidades de
Terapia Intensiva respondam rapidamente a essas situações.*

*O desenho do estudo é comparável a um estudo de diagnóstico, onde a alta precisão é essencial. Serão utilizados os
conjuntos de dados da Physionet e o algoritmo tentará minimizar os falsos negativos e positivos.*

*O resultado esperado é a concretização de um novo método que, além de preciso, realiza essa tarefa usando tecnologia de
ponta de análise de séries temporais que requeira o mínimo de memória e processamento para resolver esse problema. Além
disso, espera-se que a utilização de "fading factors" possam contribuir para o estado da arte desta tecnologia.*

*A equipe de pesquisa é experiente em séries temporais e estuda o "Matrix Profile" desde suas raizes, sendo fundadores
da "Matrix Profile Foundation", cujo objetivo é ter uma API multi-linguagem concisa e estável para desenvolvimento com a
tecnologia "Matrix Profile".* [@Bischoff2019a; @VanBenschoten2020]

Currently, Point-of-Care (POC) ECG monitoring works either as plot devices or alarms for abnormal cardiac rhythms using
predefined normal trigger ranges. On the other hand, full 12-derivation ECG machines are complex to use as simple
monitors and are used with strict techniques for formal diagnostics of hearth electric conduction pathologies, and the
automatic diagnostics are derived from a full analysis of the 12-dimension data after it is fully collected. Both
systems do not handle disconnected leads and patient's motions, being strictly necessary to have a good and stable
signal to allow proper diagnosis.

This research aims to identify abnormal hearth electric patterns using streaming data, specifically those who are
life-threatening, being a reliable signal for Intensive Care Units to respond quickly to those situations.

The study design is comparable to a Diagnostic study, where high accuracy is essential. It will use the Physionet
datasets, and the algorithm will try to minimize the false negatives and false positives.

The expected result is the concretization of a new method that, besides being accurate, accomplishes this task using
state of the art technology for time series analysis that allows minimum space and processor power to solve this
problem. Also, we expect that fading factors can contribute to the state of the art of this technology.

The research team is well experienced in time-series and has studied the Matrix Profile since its beginning, being
founders of the Matrix Profile Foundation whose goal is to have a concise and stable cross-language API for developing
with the Matrix Profile technology.[@Bischoff2019a; @VanBenschoten2020]

# Rationale

Currently, Point-of-Care (POC) ECG monitoring works either as plot devices and/or alarms for abnormal cardiac rhythms
using predefined normal trigger ranges. On the other hand, full 12-derivation ECG machines are complex to use as simple
monitors and are used with strict techniques for formal diagnostics of hearth electric conduction pathologies, and the
automatic diagnostics are derived from a full analysis of the 12-dimension data after it is fully collected. In
CinC/Physionet Challenge 2015, it has been reported that up to 86% resulting of the alarms are false and this can lead
to decreased staff attention and increase in patients delirium [@Lawless1994; @Chambrin2001; @Parthasarathy2004].

# Research question and aims

This research aims to identify, on streaming data, abnormal hearth electric patterns, specifically those who are
life-threatening, in order to be a reliable signal for Intensive Care Units to respond quickly to those situations. It
also may be able to continuously analyze new data and correct itself shutting off false alarms. Primarily an experiment
will be conducted using 2 main algorithms that use Matrix Profile in detecting context changes: SDTD and FLOSS. One uses
whole data training and testing, and the other uses a streaming approach that is our main interest. The goal will be
detecting the transition from normal to flutter/FA to normal condition with special attention to not rely on rhythm
changes. Being this successful, a more generalistic approach will be attempted: to detect changes from normal to
abnormal to normal conditions, with special attention to handle with disconnected leads or patient movements. Finally,
this research can prove to be a good addition to the Matrix Profile method, using fading factors in order to reduce
memory and space consumption, lowering the processor power needed, allowing this algorithm to be used in almost any
device.

# Background / Literature review

In 2015 the PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology has launched a challenge to address the problem of high false alarm rates
by encouraging the development of new algorithms to improve the specificity of ICU alarms[@Clifford2015]. This challenge
comprised of minimizing the false alarms for five life-threatening arrhythmia: asystole, extreme bradycardia, extreme
tachycardia, ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation or flutter.

There are other arrhytmias that this challenge didn't assessed, like atrial standstill (hyperkalemia), third-degree
atrioventricular block and others that may be life-threatening in some settings like atrial fibrillation (AF), a,
atrialflutter and paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia. Pulseless electrical activity is a frequent condition in
cardiac arrest but cannot be identified without blood pressure information.

They used as score the following formula:

</center>

The five-best scores (for real-time) in this challenge were:

)

```

A literature review will be conducted to assess the state of the art for ECG automatic processing:

-   The memory and space used to perform the main goal of the algorithm (sound an alarm for ex.) will be collected i
    available.
-   The type of algorithms used to identify ECG anomalies
-   The type of algorithms used to identify specific diagnosis (like a flutter, hyperkalemia, etc.)
-   Their performance (accuracy, ROC, etc.)

A broad search will be conducted on Pubmed, Scopus, Google Scholar, device manuals, and other specific sources.

Keywords:

-   ECG AND monitoring AND ICU
-   ECG AND \[time series\]
-   ECG AND automatic AND interpretation

Articles published after "The PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2015: Reducing False Arrhythmia Alarms in the
ICU", will also be analyzed.

# Research plan and methods

## Type of study

This will be a diagnostic study as the algorithm must classify the change in pattern as positive or negative for
life-threatening.

## Selection of data

Initially, the data used for exploring the properties of the algorithm will be publicly available data on
Physionet[@Goldberger2000; @Clifford2015].

It will be asked for Physionet's permission to use more sensitive data if needed.

It is desirable that real data extracted from Portuguese ICU could be used in the final stage to assess in real settings
the validity of the model.

## Sample size

There is no upper size limitation for the sample size. At least one hundred cases may be reasonable to start with.

## Variables

The first available dataset contains either 549 conventional 12-lead resting ECGs or the corresponding measured Frank
Lead System ECGs. The ECGs are digitized at a sampling rate of 1000Hz (0.5 µV/LSB; 16 Bit ADC). On special request, this
database may be available at sampling rates up to 10,000Hz.

Every patient is supplied with an information string containing age, gender, diagnosis, and where applicable, data on
the medical history, medications and interventions, coronary artery pathology, ventriculography, echocardiography, and
hemodynamics.

These variables may or may not be useful for increasing the sensitivity or specificity of the algorithm. It is planned
to use the minimum set of derivations from the 12-lead ECG to classify at first a common Atrial Fibrillation.

## Statistical analysis

The Statistical analysis will be performed using R language v3.6.0 or greater, and it will be computed the ROC curve for
the algorithm.
