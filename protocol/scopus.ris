AB  - Electrocardiography (ECG) is a key non-invasive diagnostic tool for cardiovascular diseases which is increasingly supported by algorithms based on machine learning. Major obstacles for the development of automatic ECG interpretation algorithms are both the lack of public datasets and well-defined benchmarking procedures to allow comparison s of different algorithms. To address these issues, we put forward PTB-XL, the to-date largest freely accessible clinical 12-lead ECG-waveform dataset comprising 21837 records from 18885 patients of 10 seconds length. The ECG-waveform data was annotated by up to two cardiologists as a multi-label dataset, where diagnostic labels were further aggregated into super and subclasses. The dataset covers a broad range of diagnostic classes including, in particular, a large fraction of healthy records. The combination with additional metadata on demographics, additional diagnostic statements, diagnosis likelihoods, manually annotated signal properties as well as suggested folds for splitting training and test sets turns the dataset into a rich resource for the development and the evaluation of automatic ECG interpretation algorithms. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) is the leading cause of human mortality and morbidity around the world, in which myocardial infarction (MI) is a silent condition that irreversibly damages the heart muscles. Currently, electrocardiogram (ECG) is widely used by the clinicians to diagnose MI patients due to its inexpensiveness and non-invasive nature. Pathological alterations provoked by MI cause slow conduction by increasing axial resistance on coupling between cells. This issue may cause abnormal patterns in the dynamics of the tip of the cardiac vector in the ECG signals. However, manual interpretation of the pathological alternations induced by MI is a time-consuming, tedious and subjective task. To overcome such disadvantages, computer-aided diagnosis techniques including signal processing and artificial intelligence tools have been developed. In this study we propose a novel technique for automatic detection of MI based on hybrid feature extraction and artificial intelligence tools. Tunable quality factor (Q-factor) wavelet transform (TQWT), variational mode decomposition (VMD) and phase space reconstruction (PSR) are utilized to extract representative features to form cardiac vectors with synthesis of the standard 12-lead and Frank XYZ leads. They are combined with neural networks to model, identify and detect abnormal patterns in the dynamics of cardiac system caused by MI. First, 12-lead ECG signals are reduced to 3-dimensional VCG signals, which are synthesized with Frank XYZ leads to build a hybrid 4-dimensional cardiac vector. Second, this vector is decomposed into a set of frequency subbands with a number of decomposition levels by using the TQWT method. Third, VMD is employed to decompose the subband of the 4-dimensional cardiac vector into different intrinsic modes, in which the first intrinsic mode contains the majority of the cardiac vector's energy and is considered to be the predominant intrinsic mode. It is selected to construct the reference variable for analysis. Fourth, phase space of the reference variable is reconstructed, in which the properties associated with the nonlinear cardiac system dynamics are preserved. Three-dimensional (3D) PSR together with Euclidean distance (ED) has been utilized to derive features, which demonstrate significant difference in cardiac system dynamics between normal (healthy) and MI cardiac vector signals. Fifth, cardiac system dynamics can be modeled and identified using neural networks, which employ the ED of 3D PSR of the reference variable as the input features. The difference of cardiac system dynamics between healthy control and MI cardiac vector is computed and used for the detection of MI based on a bank of estimators. Finally, data sets, which include conventional 12-lead and Frank XYZ leads ECG signal fragments from 148 patients with MI and 52 healthy controls from PTB diagnostic ECG database, are used for evaluation. By using the 10-fold cross-validation style, the achieved average classification accuracy is reported to be 97.98%. Currently, ST segment evaluation is one of the major and traditional ways for the MI detection. However, there exist weak or even undetectable ST segments in many ECG signals. Since the proposed method does not rely on the information of ST waves, it can serve as a complementary MI detection algorithm in the intensive care unit (ICU) of hospitals to assist the clinicians in confirming their diagnosis. Overall, our results verify that the proposed features may satisfactorily reflect cardiac system dynamics, and are complementary to the existing ECG features for automatic cardiac function analysis. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - BACKGROUND The correct interpretation of the ECG is pivotal for the accurate diagnosis of many cardiac abnormalities, and conventional computerized interpretation has not been able to reach physician-level accuracy in detecting (acute) cardiac abnormalities. This study aims to develop and validate a deep neural network for comprehensive automated ECG triage in daily practice. METHODS AND RESULTS We developed a 37-layer convolutional residual deep neural network on a data set of free-text physician-annotated 12-lead ECGs. The deep neural network was trained on a data set with 336.835 recordings from 142.040 patients and validated on an independent validation data set (n=984), annotated by a panel of 5 cardiologists electrophysiologists. The 12-lead ECGs were acquired in all noncardiology departments of the University Medical Center Utrecht. The algorithm learned to classify these ECGs into the following 4 triage categories: normal, abnormal not acute, subacute, and acute. Discriminative performance is presented with overall and category-specific concordance statistics, polytomous discrimination indexes, sensitivities, specificities, and positive and negative predictive values. The patients in the validation data set had a mean age of 60.4 years and 54.3% were men. The deep neural network showed excellent overall discrimination with an overall concordance statistic of 0.93 (95% CI, 0.92-0.95) and a polytomous discriminatory index of 0.83 (95% CI, 0.79-0.87). CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrates that an end-to-end deep neural network can be accurately trained on unstructured free-text physician annotations and used to consistently triage 12-lead ECGs. When further fine-tuned with other clinical outcomes and externally validated in clinical practice, the demonstrated deep learning-based ECG interpretation can potentially improve time to treatment and decrease healthcare burden.

AB  - One of the most dangerous cardiovascular diseases is Myocardial Infarction for human beings. It is commonly recognized as heart attack. Myocardial Infarction (MI) is caused by the impairment of cardiac muscle. The Electro Cardio Gram logs the electric pulse of the heart and these data are able to reflect the aberrant actions of the heart. When there is a block in veins of heart the flow of oxygen to cardiovascular muscle gets stopped which make hurt to heart muscles. The irrevocable harm may prompt to mortality. With the quick upgradation of wearable devices and favorable electrocardiogram (ECG) clinical apparatus, it is reasonable and feasible to identify and screen dead tissue in heart muscles. Fast and accurate identification of Myocardial Infarction is necessary to decrease the mortality rate. Physical Electro Cardio Gram understanding needs skilled and is leads to inter-observer variability and more time is consumed for it. The physical interpretation may change from one individual to another. Automatic detection of MI on ECG can be done with a computer aided diagnosis. The aim is to give an algorithm for the ML detection that process directly on information of ECG. The images are classified using a deep learning model with ResNet and images are identified to check whether there is a presence of Myocardial Infarction or not. The ResNet is capable of calculating an image accurately. The proposed ResNet model yields 96% accuracy for the given dataset. © 2020 SERSC.

AB  - Cardiovascular diseases correspond to the leading cause of death in the world and carry a high cost. In addition, the workforce of cardiologists is constantly decreasing. Therefore, automatic algorithms for the classification of heartbeats from electrocardiogram (ECG) registers have been developed. The classification of heartbeats from ECG records is a complex problem, with many edges and that, although several works have been developed that address the issue, it is not as clear which of them achieves better results, as there are discrepancies in the comparison and only those who adopt the same paradigm (intra-patient, inter-patient or patient-specific) are justly comparable. The ECG waveform has several deflections (waves). The analysis and automatic interpretation of this signal is often computer assisted using signal processing and pattern recognition techniques. This paper presents a theoretical review of deep learning and traditional methods based ECG classification. © 2020 IJSTR.

AB  - This paper describes the design and implementation of an IoT-based smart doctor kit for a critical medical condition that can provide a versatile connection to IOT data that can help emergency health services such as Intensive Care Units (ICU).In recent technology, IoT gives base where the user can access all information regarding health from anywhere. Some of the Example where IOT are used such as Connected Car Smart Home, and Health Monitoring System. Now in recent days, the healthcare control system is necessary to regularly monitor the patient's physiological parameters. Heart Beat, body temp, ECG and Respiration are the physiological parameters of the body. The process of measuring these body parameters are called Health monitoring. Different sensors are used to monitor this data and this data is continuously monitored and send towards the internet server or on a mobile app. main advantage of health monitoring is that it reduces human error. The proposed model allows users to achieve better health-related risks and minimizes healthcare costs by collecting, recording, testing and distributing large data in real-time and perfectly. The idea behind this paper is to reduce the patient's worry about visiting a doctor every time. The time not only of patients but also of doctors is saved with the aid of this project proposal, so doctors can also help patients as much as possible in critical condition. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death worldwide, and coronary artery disease (CAD) is a major contributor. Early-stage CAD can progress if undiagnosed and left untreated, leading to myocardial infarction (MI) that may induce irreversible heart muscle damage, resulting in heart chamber remodeling and eventual congestive heart failure (CHF). Electrocardiography (ECG) signals can be useful to detect established MI, and may also be helpful for early diagnosis of CAD. For the latter especially, the ECG perturbations can be subtle and potentially misclassified during manual interpretation and/or when analyzed by traditional algorithms found in ECG instrumentation. For automated diagnostic systems (ADS), deep learning techniques are favored over conventional machine learning techniques, due to the automatic feature extraction and selection processes involved. This paper highlights various deep learning algorithms exploited for the classification of ECG signals into CAD, MI, and CHF conditions. The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), followed by combined CNN and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models, appear to be the most useful architectures for classification. A 16-layer LSTM model was developed in our study and validated using 10-fold cross-validation. A classification accuracy of 98.5% was achieved. Our proposed model has the potential to be a useful diagnostic tool in hospitals for the classification of abnormal ECG signals. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study proposes a dedicated algorithm to estimate heart rate (HR) and respiratory rate (RR) from seismocardiogram (SCG). The proposed algorithm primarily consists of the wavelet decomposition (by db6 wavelet), the Fourier-based envelope detection and the time-averaged power spectral density (PSD) from the scalogram by complex Morlet wavelet. The records in the combined measurement of ECG, breathing and SCG (CEBS) database of PhysioNet are adopted to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm for HR and RR estimation. The performance was evaluated by intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and Bland-Altman's agreement analysis. The statistical results for HR estimation show good to excellent correlation between the approaches by SCG and ECG and also meet the maximal allowable error for the HR meter. As the quality of some respiratory signals in the CEBS database is not good for RR estimation, additional experiments have been conducted in the university laboratory under well-controlled procedure. The statistical results for the RR estimation in these experiments show good to excellent correlation between the approaches of RR estimation by SCG and respiratory signal. The RR estimation from SCG also meets the specification given in contemporary medical device. The proposed algorithm does not take the removal of motion artifact into account and thus SCG signal must be measured under resting state. From this study, SCG can be a potential tool to estimate HR and RR for monitoring the patient in intensive care unit (ICU) or monitoring the sleep quality in clinical setting or in daily life. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: No direct comparison of current electrocardiogram (ECG) interpretation programs exists. Objective: Assess the accuracy of ECG interpretation programs in detecting abnormal rhythms and flagging for priority review records with alterations secondary to acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Methods: More than 2,000 digital ECGs from hospitals and databases in Europe, USA, and Australia, were obtained from consecutive adult and pediatric patients and converted to 10 s analog samples that were replayed on seven electrocardiographs and classified by the manufacturers' interpretation programs. We assessed ability to distinguish sinus rhythm from non-sinus rhythm, identify atrial fibrillation/flutter and other abnormal rhythms, and accuracy in flagging results for priority review. If all seven programs' interpretation statements did not agree, cases were reviewed by experienced cardiologists. Results: All programs could distinguish well between sinus and non-sinus rhythms and could identify atrial fibrillation/flutter or other abnormal rhythms. However, false-positive rates varied from 2.1% to 5.5% for non-sinus rhythm, from 0.7% to 4.4% for atrial fibrillation/flutter, and from 1.5% to 3.0% for other abnormal rhythms. False-negative rates varied from 12.0% to 7.5%, 9.9% to 2.7%, and 55.9% to 30.5%, respectively. Flagging of ACS varied by a factor of 2.5 between programs. Physicians flagged more ECGs for prompt review, but also showed variance of around a factor of 2. False-negative values differed between programs by a factor of 2 but was high for all (>50%). Agreement between programs and majority reviewer decisions was 46–62%. Conclusions: Automatic interpretations of rhythms and ACS differ between programs. Healthcare institutions should not rely on ECG software “critical result” flags alone to decide the ACS workflow. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Refeeding syndrome (RFS) is a rare, potentially life-threatening, condition seen in malnourished patients starting refeeding. RFS may provoke seizures and acute encephalopathy and can be considered an internal severe neurotrauma in need of specific treatment. The objective was to describe course of disease, treatment and, for the first time, multimodal monitoring output in a comatose patient suffering RFS. After gastric-banding and severe weight loss, the patient initiated self-starving and was transferred to our intensive care unit (ICU) following rapid refeeding. At arrival, seizures, decrease in consciousness (GCS 7) and suspected acute encephalitis was presented. Serum albumin was 8 g/l. Intracranial pressure (ICP), invasive blood pressure and electrocardiography (ECG) were monitored. Pressure reactivity (PRx) and compliance (RAP) were calculated. The patient developed congestive heart failure, anuria and general oedema despite maximal neuro- and general ICU treatment. Global cerebral oedema and hypoperfusion areas with established ischemia were seen. ECG revealed massive cardiac arrhythmia and disturbed autonomic regulation. PRx indicated intact autoregulation (−0.06 ± 0.18, mean ± SD) and relatively normal compliance (RAP = 0.23 ± 0.13). After 15 days the clinical state was improved, and the patient returned to the primary hospital. RFS was associated with serious deviations in homeostasis, high ICP levels, ECG abnormalities, kidney and lung affections. It is of utmost importance to recognize this rare syndrome and to treat appropriately. Despite the severe clinical state, cerebral autoregulation and compensatory reserve were generally normal, questioning the applicability of indirect measurements such as PRx and RAP during neuro-intensive care treatment of RFS patients with cerebral engagement. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - The electrocardiogram records the cardiovascular action, is widely utilized for diagnosing heart diseases. Thus, the ECG turned into a normal piece of any complete medical evaluation. Moreover, the ECG became a basic device that allows observing a patient who is at home. R-peak is the basis peak for reliable health condition observing. The ECG has been treated as one of the least difficult techniques for automatic detection of the QRS complex. Nevertheless, the ECG signal transmission is often accompanied by noise due to poor channel conditions. This paper aims to remove the noise from the ECG signal to present a signal that makes a visual interpretation easier. Numerous techniques launched to improve the ECG signal. Accordingly, we address the ECG signal through three techniques: Empirical Mode Decomposition, Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition, and Complementary Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition. Moreover, we will make some improvements to the ECG signal using the Butterworth filter and Wavelet filter. Finally, this research provides a comparison of the result obtained from all models based on four different types of classification algorithms: K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes, and Random Forest. Consequently, we are investigating various tests to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach to discover the best steps to address the ECG signals. © School of Engineering, Taylor's University

AB  - Electrocardiography is a useful diagnostic tool for various cardiovascular diseases, such as myocardial infarction (MI). An electrocardiograph (ECG) records the electrical activity of the heart, which can reflect any abnormal activity. MI recognition by visual examination of an ECG requires an expert’s interpretation and is difficult because of the short duration and small amplitude of the changes in ECG signals associated with MI. Therefore, we propose a new method for the automatic detection of MI using ECG signals. In this study, we used maximal overlap discrete wavelet transform to decompose the data, extracted the variance, inter-quartile range, Pearson correlation coefficient, Hoeffding’s D correlation coefficient and Shannon entropy of the wavelet coefficients and used the k-nearest neighbor model to detect MI. The accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of the model were 99.57%, 99.82% and 98.79%, respectively. Therefore, the system can be used in clinics to help diagnose MI. © 2020, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Background: Ventricular tachycardia (V-tach) is the most common lethal arrhythmia, yet 90% of alarms are false and contribute to alarm fatigue. We hypothesize that some true V-tach also causes alarm fatigue because current criteria are too sensitive (i.e., ≥6 beats ≥100 beats/min [bpm]). Purpose: This study was designed to determine (1) the proportion of clinically actionable true V-tach events; (2) whether true actionable versus nonactionable V-tach differs in terms of heart rate and/or duration (seconds); and (3) if actionable V-tach is associated with adverse outcomes. Methods: This was a secondary analysis in 460 intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Electronic health records were examined to determine if a V-tach event was actionable or nonactionable. Actionable V-tach was defined if a clinical action(s) was taken within 15 minutes of its occurrence (i.e., new and/or change of medication, defibrillation, and/or laboratory test). Maximal heart rate and duration for each V-tach event were measured from bedside monitor electrocardiography. Adverse patient outcomes included a code blue event and/or death. Results: In 460 ICU patients, 50 (11%) had 151 true V-tach events (range 1-20). Of the 50 patients, 40 (80%) had only nonactionable V-tach (97 events); 3 (6%) had both actionable and nonactionable V-tach (32 events); and 7 patients (14%) had only actionable V-tach (23 events). There were differences in duration comparing actionable versus nonactionable V-tach (mean 56.19 ± 116.87 seconds vs. 4.28 ± 4.09 seconds; P = 0.001) and maximal heart rate (188.81 ± 116.83 bpm vs. 150.79 ± 28.26 bpm; P = 0.001). Of the 50 patients, 3 (6%) had a code blue, 2 died, and all were in the actionable V-tach group. Conclusions: In our sample, <1% experienced a code blue following true V-tach. Heart rate and duration for actionable V-tach were much faster and longer than that for nonactionable V-tach. Current default settings typically used for electrocardiographic monitoring (i.e., ≥6 beats ≥100 bpm) appear to be too conservative and can lead to crisis/red level nuisance alarms that contribute to alarm fatigue. A prospective study designed to test whether adjusting default settings to these higher levels is safe for patients is needed. © 2020 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: It is widely accepted by the scientific community that bioelectrical signals, which can be used for the identification of neurophysiological biomarkers indicative of a diseased or pathological state, could direct patient treatment towards more effective therapeutic strategies. However, the design and realisation of an instrument that can precisely record weak bioelectrical signals in the presence of strong interference stemming from a noisy clinical environment is one of the most difficult challenges associated with the strategy of monitoring bioelectrical signals for diagnostic purposes. Moreover, since patients often have to cope with the problem of limited mobility being connected to bulky and mains-powered instruments, there is a growing demand for small-sized, high-performance and ambulatory biopotential acquisition systems in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and in High-dependency wards. Finally, to the best of our knowledge, there are no commercial, small, battery-powered, wearable and wireless recording-only instruments that claim the capability of recording electrocorticographic (ECoG) signals. Methods: To address this problem, we designed and developed a low-noise (8 nV/√Hz), eight-channel, battery-powered, wearable and wireless instrument (55 × 80 mm2). The performance of the realised instrument was assessed by conducting both ex vivo and in vivo experiments. Results: To provide ex vivo proof-of-function, a wide variety of high-quality bioelectrical signal recordings are reported, including electroencephalographic (EEG), electromyographic (EMG), electrocardiographic (ECG), acceleration signals, and muscle fasciculations. Low-noise in vivo recordings of weak local field potentials (LFPs), which were wirelessly acquired in real time using segmented deep brain stimulation (DBS) electrodes implanted in the thalamus of a non-human primate, are also presented. Conclusions: The combination of desirable features and capabilities of this instrument, namely its small size (∼one business card), its enhanced recording capabilities, its increased processing capabilities, its manufacturability (since it was designed using discrete off-the-shelf components), the wide bandwidth it offers (0.5-500 Hz) and the plurality of bioelectrical signals it can precisely record, render it a versatile and reliable tool to be utilized in a wide range of applications and environments. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Heart disease is one of the most life-threatening diseases in today's world. Monitoring of ECG in ICCU or ICU contineously using wired monitoring system becomes very inconvenient to the subject. Therefore, an innovative portable wearable wireless system has been developed to monitor the same using conventional bed-side monitor or computer continuously with comfort. The patient is free to move and carry out activities suggested by physician and therepist without any restrictions. The sub-carrier modulator presented in this system is a novel technique that eliminates the need for ADC, Microcontroller or Microprocessor. The system is wearable, portable and low cost. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - Prolongation of the QTc interval may lead to life threatening arrhythmias. QTc prolongation is common in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. The objectives of this study were to identify the role of drug-drug interactions (DDIs) and other predictors (age, sex, cardiovascular diseases, and electrolyte abnormalities) in life threatening QTc prolongation in patients admitted to medical (M), surgical (S) and emergency (E) ICUs. This prospective, observational study included patients above the age of 18 years who were admitted to SICU, EICU, and MICU at a tertiary respiratory referral center. Electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring was performed during the first 5 days of ICU admission. Risk factors and DDIs which were anticipated to be associated with the prolongation of the QTc interval were assessed for all patients. Two hundred patients were included in the study. QTc prolongation occurred in 10.7% of patients and the majority of patients presenting with QTc prolongation had creatinine levels above 1.3 mg/dL during their 5 days of ICU admission. Incidence of pharmacodynamic (PD) DDIs was significantly higher in patients with QTc prolongation vs. other patients. Creatinine levels above 1.3 mg/dL and PD DDIs were associated with QTc prolongation during 5 days of ICU admission. High serum creatinine and PD DDIs can increase the risk of QTc prolongation in patients admitted to the ICU. QTc interval measurements should be performed prior to initiation or after starting any drug that is associated with QT prolongation, specifically in patients with the known risk factors. © 2019 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.

Methods: Sixty patients of severe heart failure admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) of Fujian Provincial Hospital from August 2017 to February 2019 were enrolled, and they were divided into control group and treatment group according to random number table method, with 30 in each group. The treatment group used bedside PiCCO to carry out minimally invasive hemodynamics monitoring, according to the monitoring data target guidance for vasoactive drugs and liquid management. The control group was based only on traditional electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring and lung sound, urine volume of vasoactive drugs and liquid management. The changes of cardiac index (CI), global end diastolic volume index (GEDVI), extravascular lung water index (EVLWI), systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI), invasive mean arterial pressure (MAP) and central venous pressure (CVP) were observed before and 72 hours after treatment in the treatment group. The 7-day total effective rate, the length of ICU stay and 28-day mortality were compared between the two groups. Results: Compared with before treatment, CI and MAP in the treatment group were significantly increased after treatment [CI (mL·s-1·m-2): 53.34±16.67 vs. 35.01±13.34, MAP (mmHg, 1 mmHg = 0.133 kPa): 72.6±10.6 vs. 62.5±10.3, both P &lt; 0.05], GEDVI, EVLWI, SVRI, CVP were significantly decreased [GEDVI (mL/m2): 760.3±90.2 vs. 960.2±110.3, EVLWI (mL/kg): 6.5±1.3 vs. 12.5±6.2, SVRI (kPa·s·L-1·m-2): 297.3±35.1 vs. 434.1±58.8, CVP (mmHg): 10.1±2.6 vs. 12.2±3.4, all P &lt; 0.05]. Compared with the control group, the 7-day total effective rate of the treatment group was significantly higher (90.0% vs. 80.0%), the length of ICU stay was significantly shorter (days: 8.2±4.5 vs. 10.3±2.5), and the 28-day mortality was significantly lower, with statistically significant difference (all P &lt; 0.05). Conclusion: PiCCO monitoring is a goal-oriented treatment management for patients with severe heart failure, which is helpful to individualized accurate treatment, shorten the length of ICU stay and improve short-term prognosis. © 2019 Heilongjiang Institute of Science and Technology Information.

AB  - Background: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is often detected for the first time in patients hospitalized for medical illness or non-cardiovascular surgery. AF occurring transiently with stress (AFOTS) describes this manifestation of AF, which may either be the result of a non-cardiac stressor, or existing paroxysmal AF that was not previously detected. Current estimates of AFOTS incidence are imprecise: ranging from 1 to 44%, owing to the marked heterogeneity in patient populations, identification and methods used to detect AFOTS. Methods: The prospective, two-centre epidemiological AFOTS Incidence study will enroll 250 consecutive participants without a history of AF but with at increased risk of AF (Age ≥ 65 or >50 with one risk factor for AF) admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) for medical illness or non-cardiac surgery. Upon admission, participants will wear an ECG patch monitor that will remain in place for 14 days, or until discharge from hospital. Patients' consent to participation is deferred for up to 72 h after admission. The primary endpoint is the incidence of AF lasting ≥30 s. The study is powered to detect an AF incidence of 17% ± 5%. Results: We conducted a vanguard feasibility study, and 55 participants have completed participation. The median duration of monitoring was seven days. AF was detected by the clinical team in 8 participants (14%; 95% Confidence Interval 7–26%). Conclusions: The AFOTS Incidence study will employ a systematic and highly sensitive protocol for detecting AFOTS in medical illness and non-cardiac surgery ICU patients. This study is feasible and will provide a reliable estimate of the true incidence of AFOTS in this population. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Objectives: To develop and evaluate a fully automatic method to measure diameters of the ascending and descending aorta on non-ECG-gated, non-contrast computed tomography (CT) scans. Material and methods: The method combines multi-atlas registration to obtain seed points, aorta centerline extraction, and an optimal surface segmentation approach to extract the aorta surface around the centerline. From the extracted 3D aorta segmentation, the diameter of the ascending and descending aorta was calculated at cross-sectional slices perpendicular to the extracted centerline, at the level of the pulmonary artery bifurcation, and at 1-cm intervals up to 3 cm above and below this level. Agreement with manual annotations was evaluated by dice similarity coefficient (DSC) for segmentation overlap, mean surface distance (MSD), and intra-class correlation (ICC) of diameters on 100 CT scans from a lung cancer screening trial. Repeatability of the diameter measurements was evaluated on 617 baseline-one year follow-up CT scan pairs. Results: The agreement between manual and automatic segmentations was good with 0.95 ± 0.01 DSC and 0.56 ± 0.08 mm MSD. ICC between the diameters derived from manual and from automatic segmentations was 0.97, with the per-level ICC ranging from 0.87 to 0.94. An ICC of 0.98 for all measurements and per-level ICC ranging from 0.91 to 0.96 were obtained for repeatability. Conclusion: This fully automatic method can assess diameters in the thoracic aorta reliably even in non-ECG-gated, non-contrast CT scans. This could be a promising tool to assess aorta dilatation in screening and in clinical practice. Key Points: • Fully automatic method to assess thoracic aorta diameters. • High agreement between fully automatic method and manual segmentations. • Method is suitable for non-ECG-gated CT and can therefore be used in screening. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - Recent research has proven the existence of statistical relation among fragmented QRS and several highly prevalence diseases, such as cardiac sarcoidosis, acute coronary syndrome, arrythmogenic cardiomyopathies, Brugada syndrome, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. One out of five hundred people suffer from hypertrophic cardiomyopathies. The relation among the fragmentation and arrhythmias drives the objective of this work, which is to propose a valid method for QRS fragmentation detection. With that aim, we followed a two-stage approach. First, we identified the features that better characterize the fragmentation by analyzing the physiological interpretation of multivariate approaches, such as principal component analysis (PCA) and independent component analysis (ICA). Second, we created an invariant transformation method for the multilead electrocardiogram (ECG), by scrutinizing the statistical distributions of the PCA eigenvectors and of the ICA transformation arrays, in order to anchor the desired elements in the suitable leads in the feature space. A complete database was compounded incorporating real fragmented ECGs, surrogate registers by synthetically adding fragmented activity to real non-fragmented ECG registers, and standard clean ECGs. Results showed that the creation of beat templates together with the application of PCA over eight independent leads achieves 0.995 fragmentation enhancement ratio and 0.07 dispersion coefficient. In the case of ICA over twelve leads, the results were 0.995 fragmentation enhancement ratio and 0.70 dispersion coefficient. We conclude that the algorithm presented in this work constructs a new paradigm, by creating a systematic and powerful tool for clinical anamnesis and evaluation based on multilead ECG. This approach consistently consolidates the inconspicuous elements present in multiple leads onto designated variables in the output space, hence offering additional and valid visual and non-visual information to standard clinical review, and opening the door to a more accurate automatic detection and statistically valid systematic approach for a wide number of applications. In this direction and within the companion paper, further developments are presented applying this technique to fragmentation detection. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Today, one of the most actual problems of cardiology is to obtain comprehensive data in everyday life to determine current cardiac states, including hidden pathologies, their interpretation and analysis. This article proposes a new method for processing measurements obtained during Holter monitoring and using only the value of the intervals between R peaks of ECG. These peaks have the biggest amplitude and their determination does not present technical difficulties. The improved graphical analysis method proposed by the authors, 'Speed Spot', allows to take into account not only the data of heart rate variability, but also includes an integral characteristic of the rate of change of the variability components. The method was used to determine the type of pathology as atrial fibrillation (AF). To confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method for the detection of arrhythmias, the Atrial Fibrillation Database of www.physionet.org was used, containing records of both normal and arrhythmic signals. A comparative analysis of the SS with Poincaré clouds for five patients with AF showed that this method is more sensitive and requires less data to determine the controlled cardiovascular state compared to similar ones. The criteria for estimating the degree of HRV (instability) by the 'Speed Spot' can be the geometrical dimensions of an ellipse: the length and width and the coordinate of its center. The proposed method, due to the symmetry of the distribution of cloud points with respect to the x-axis, provides more opportunities for use in systems for automatic tracking of heart rate disturbances. Practical application of the method to automatically determine the degree and type of arrhythmia is an object for further research. Further development of the method involves applying it to other types of hidden cardiopathology. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - Right ventricular dysfunction (RVD) is associated with end-organ dysfunction and mortality, but has been an overlooked condition in the ICU. We hypothesized that analysis of the arterial waveform in the presence of ventricular extrasystoles could differentiate patients with RVD from patients with a normally functioning right ventricle, because the 2nd and 3rd post-ectopic beat could reflect right ventricular state (pulmonary transit time) during the preceding ectopy. We retrospectively identified patients with echocardiographic evidence of moderate-to-severe RVD and patients with a normal functioning right ventricle (control) from the MIMIC database. We identified waveform records where ECG and arterial pressure were available in combination, simultaneously with echocardiographic evaluation. Ventricular extrasystoles were visually confirmed and the median systolic blood pressure (SBP) of the 2nd and 3rd post-ectopic beats compared with the median SBP of the ten sinus beats preceding the extrasystole. We identified 34 patients in the control group and 24 patients in the RVD group with ventricular extrasystoles. The mean SBP reduction at the 2nd and 3rd beat was lower in the RVD group compared with the control group [− 1.7 (SD: 1.9) % vs. − 3.6 (SD: 1.9) %, p < 0.001], and this characteristic differentiated RVD subjects from control subjects with an AUC of 0.76 (CI [0.64; 0.89]), with a specificity of 91% and sensitivity of 50%. In this proof-of-concept study, we found that post-extrasystolic ABP characteristics were associated with RVD. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Electrocardiogram (ECG) is a primary diagnostic tool for cardiovascular diseases. A higher accuracy of heart diseases needs an automatic classification for intelligent interpretation of cardiac arrhythmia. The classification process consists of following stages: detection of QRS complex in ECG signal, feature extraction from detected QRS using R-R interval, segmentation of rhythms using extracted feature set, learning system by using Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). The performance is analyzed as a rhythm of arrhythmia classifier and MIT-BIH arrhythmia database uses to validate the method. To benchmark, the performance of DNNs algorithm is compared to, MLP and SVM algorithm in terms of accuracy. The result obtained show that the proposed method provides good accuracy about 97.7 % with less expert interaction. © 2019 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - In this work, a novel method has been proposed for false alarm detection in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) during arrhythmia. To detect false alarm, various inputs are used such as electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, atrial blood pressure (ABP), photoplethysmogram signals (PLETH) and respiration (RESP). The inputs are given to decision tree predictive learner (DTPL) based classifier for thedetection of false alarm. The proposed method has an accuracy of 97% for prediction of false alarm in ICU. Theresult of the proposed method is promising which suggest that it can be used effectively for false alarm detection in ICUs. To the best of our knowledge, there is no such assumption based classification approach. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most prevalent arrhythmia, resulting in varying and irregular heartbeats. AF increases risk for numerous cardiovascular diseases including stroke, heart failure and as a result, computer aided efficient monitoring of AF is crucial, especially for intensive care unit (ICU) patients. In this paper, we present an automated and robust algorithm to detect AF from ICU patients using electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. Several statistical parameters including root mean square of successive differences, Shannon entropy, Sample entropy and turning point ratio are calculated from the heart rate. A subset of the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) SH database containing 36 subjects is used in this study. We compare the AF detection performance of several classifiers for both the training and blinded test data. Using the support vector machine classifier with radial basis kernel, the proposed method achieves 99.95% cross-validation accuracy on the training data and 99.88% sensitivity, 99.65% specificity and 99.75% accuracy on the blinded test data. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - The high rate of false alarms in intensive care units (ICUs) is one of the top challenges of using medical technology in hospitals. These false alarms are often caused by patients' movements, detachment of monitoring sensors, or different sources of noise and interference that impact the collected signals from different monitoring devices. In this paper, we propose a novel set of high-level features based on unsupervised feature learning technique in order to effectively capture the characteristics of different arrhythmia in electrocardiogram (ECG) signal and differentiate them from irregularity in signals due to different sources of signal disturbances. This unsupervised feature learning technique, first extracts a set of low-level features from all existing heart cycles of a patient, and then clusters these segments for each individual patient to provide a set of prominent high-level features. The objective of the clustering phase is to enable the classification method to differentiate between the high-level features extracted from normal and abnormal cycles (i.e., either due to arrhythmia or different sources of distortions in signal) in order to put more attention to the features extracted from abnormal portion of the signal that contribute to the alarm. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - Aim: Early identification of cardiac involvement in acute pancreatitis and their appropriate management can decrease significant morbidity and mortality. Very few studies have focused prospectively on cardiac involvement and its association with prognosis in acute pancreatitis. Materials and Methods: Forty-two patients admitted in Acharya Vinoba Bhave Rural Hospital, Sawangi, Wardha, were enrolled in this study and were divided based on PaO2into Group 1 (PaO2&gt; 60 mmHg) and Group 2 (PaO2&lt; 60 mmHg). Hologram with peripheral smear, blood sugar both fasting and postprandial, hemoglobin A1C, blood urea, creatinine, serum bilirubin, aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, cardiac enzymes, serum amylase, and lipase were measured. Prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, and lipid profile were measured and arterial blood gas analysis was done. All patients had undergone plane chest X-ray, ultrasonography of the abdomen, contrast-enhanced computed tomography of the abdomen, electrocardiogram (ECG), and two-dimensional (2D) echocardiography (ECHO). Results: 2D echocardiographic changes were more common in Group 2 as compared to Group 1 and were statistically significant (P = 0.004). Pericardial effusion and diastolic dysfunction were more common in Group 2 and were statistically significant (P = 0.006 and 0.031, respectively) whereas the difference between the association of regional wall motion abnormality (RWMA) in the two groups was statistically insignificant (P = 0.110). Both ECG and 2D echocardiogram (ECHO) changes were reversible and were statistically significant (P = 0.05 and 0.003, respectively). The need for admission in the intensive care unit (ICU) was significantly associated with pericardial effusion (P &lt; 0.001) and diastolic dysfunction (P = 0.013) but not associated with RWMA (P = 0.710). ECG abnormalities at admission were not related to the need for mechanical ventilation and admission to ICU (P = 0.802). Conclusion: 2D ECHO abnormalities and not the ECG abnormalities were associated with a poor prognosis. Early recognition of echocardiographic changes in acute pancreatitis can predict the severity of disease and can help in the triage of patients requiring rigorous monitoring of respiratory and hemodynamic status. © 2020 Journal of Datta Meghe Institute of Medical Sciences University | Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.

AB  - A fundamental part of the analysis of electrocardiographic signals (ECG) lies in the transformation of the data or samples of the signal, with the aim of improving the effectiveness of the processing and the subsequent interpretation of the results obtained from it. Thus, a certain number of features are extracted, which are expected to have high discriminatory properties. In this way, the next step of the analysis must be the construction of a vector of features, which must be a set of descriptors that completely transmit the essence of the signal being studied. These features can focus on different aspects of the signal, for example, durations of intervals or segments, amplitudes of different wave peaks, deviations with respect to the isoelectric line, and areas under curves, among others. In this paper we present a method that includes the detection of temporal events of the ECG signal, such as ST segment, T wave, QRS complex and QT interval, several features are extracted using these events. The features are validated with the K-means algorithm and the feature vector is used as input in the ischemia classifier. © 2003-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Background: Time delay between onset of symptoms and seeking medical attention is a major determinant of mortality and morbidity in patients with acute coronary artery occlusion. Response time might be reduced by reliable self-detection. We aimed to formally assess the proof-of-concept and accuracy of self-detection of acute coronary artery occlusion by patients during daily life situations and during the very early stages of acute coronary artery occlusion. Methods: In this multicentre, observational study, we tested the operational feasibility, specificity, and sensitivity of our RELF method, a three-lead detection system with an automatic algorithm built into a mobile handheld device, for detection of acute coronary artery occlusion. Patients were recruited continuously by physician referrals from three Belgian hospitals until the desired sample size was achieved, had been discharged with planned elective percutaneous coronary intervention, and were able to use a smartphone; they were asked to perform random ambulatory self-recordings for at least 1 week. A similar self-recording was made before percutaneous coronary intervention and at 60 s of balloon occlusion. Patients were clinically followed up until 1 month after discharge. We quantitatively assessed the operational feasibility with an automated dichotomous quality check of self-recordings. Performance was assessed by analysing the receiver operator characteristics of the ST difference vector magnitude. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02983396. Findings: From Nov 18, 2016, to April 25, 2018, we enrolled 64 patients into the study, of whom 59 (92%) were eligible for self-applications. 58 (91%) of 64 (95% CI 81·0–95·6) patients were able to perform ambulatory self-recordings. Of all 5011 self-recordings, 4567 (91%) were automatically classified as successful within 1 min. In 65 balloon occlusions, 63 index tests at 60 s of occlusion in 55 patients were available. The mean specificity of daily life recordings was 0·96 (0·95–0·97). The mean false positive rate during daily life conditions was 4·19% (95% CI 3·29–5·10). The sensitivity for the target conditions was 0·87 (55 of 63; 95% CI 0·77–0·93) for acute coronary artery occlusion, 0·95 (54 of 57; 0·86–0·98) for acute coronary artery occlusion with electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, and 1·00 (35 of 35) for acute coronary artery occlusion with ECG changes and ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction criteria (STEMI). The index test was more sensitive to detect a 60 s balloon occlusion than the STEMI criteria on 12-lead ECG (87% vs 56%; p&lt;0·0001). The proportion of total variation in study estimates due to heterogeneity between patients (I2) was low (12·6%). The area under the receiver operator characteristics curve was 0·973 (95% CI 0·956–0·990) for acute coronary artery occlusion at different cutoff values of the magnitude of the ST difference vector. No patients died during the study. Interpretation: Self-recording with our RELF device is feasible for most patients with coronary artery disease. The sensitivity and specificity for automatic detection of the earliest phase of acute coronary artery occlusion support the concept of our RELF device for patient empowerment to reduce delay and increase Survival without overloading emergency services.

AB  - Myocardial infarction (MI), commonly known as heart attack, causes irreversible damage to heart muscles and even leads to death. Rapid and accurate diagnosis of MI is critical to avoid death. Blood tests and electrocardiogram (ECG) signals are used to diagnose acute MI. However, for an increase in blood enzyme values, a certain time must pass after the attack. This time lag may delay MI diagnosis. Hence, ECG diagnosis is still very important. Manual ECG interpretation requires expertise and is prone to inter-observer variability. Therefore, computer aided diagnosis may be useful in automatic detection of MI on ECG. In this study, a deep learning model with an end-to-end structure on the standard 12-lead ECG signal for the diagnosis of MI is proposed. For this purpose, the most commonly used technique, convolutional neural network (CNN) is used. Our trained CNN model with the proposed architecture yielded impressive accuracy and sensitivity performance over 99.00% for MI diagnosis on all ECG lead signals. Thus, the proposed model has the potential to provide high performance on MI detection which can be used in wearable technologies and intensive care units. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Excessive numbers of clinical alarms in the intensive care unit (ICU) contribute to alarm fatigue. Efforts to eliminate unnecessary alarms, including during end of life (EOL) care, are pivotal. This study describes electrocardiographic (ECG) arrhythmia alarm usage following the decision for comfort care. We conducted a review of electronic health records (EHR) in patients who died and had comfort care orders that were in place during our study. The occurrences of ECG arrhythmia alarms among these patients were examined. We found 151 arrhythmia alarms that were generated in 11 patients after comfort care was initiated: 72% were audible, 21% were manually muted, and 7% had an unknown audio label. Level of alarm: 33% crisis, 58% warning, 1% message, and 8% were labeled unknown. Our report shows that ECG monitoring was commonly maintained during the EOL care. Since the goal of care during this phase is for both patient and family comfort, it is important for the clinicians to weigh the benefits versus harms of the continuous ECG monitoring. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - The Electro Cardiogram Signals (ECG) are utilized for detecting cardiac abnormalities for more than a century, since cardiac-related diseases are considered as the primary cause of death for the increasing degree of patients over the years around the world. Heart Variability investigation schemes are determined to be the potential cardiac rhythms automatic classification techniques for precise assessments of rhythm disorders. However, accurate QRS and T wave detection techniques are identified for effective and reliable HRV interpretation process. This review presents the role, merits and limitations of the most recent QRS and T Wave detection techniques proposed in the literature in the last three years for confirming Cardiac Abnormalities. This survey presents a diversified number of evaluation metrics that could used for determining the predominance of the reviewed schemes. This survey also presents a list of open research issues and challenges that could be focused by the growing researchers around the world.The major outcome of the survey concentrated on the determination of merit and limitations of the existing QRS and T Wave detection techniques in order to propose future research that confirms cardiac abnormalities with minimized overhead. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - We aimed to evaluate electrocardiographic (ECG) abnormalities in mortalities due to pure methadone toxicity in ICU patients since methadone-related mortality may be due to cardiac complications even in acute toxicities. In a retrospective single-center study, files of all patients who had died with confirmed diagnosis of pure methadone toxicity between 2011 and 2016 were evaluated. Autopsy was performed in all cases. A cardiologist measured all ECG quantitative and qualitative indices. Fifty-one deaths were recorded. Forty-two dead patients were males. Median [IQR] age of the patients was 44 [30, 60] years. Of them, 38 (69%) were methadone-dependent and were significantly older than methadone-naïve patients (p = 0.008 and p = 0.001, respectively). ECG abnormalities were detected in all cases. ST-T abnormalities were found in 33 (64.7%) patients. Except longer PR interval in dependent patients (p = 0.017) and specific ST elevation in naïve cases (p = 0.008), other ECG indices were similar in two groups. No correlation was found between ST-T abnormalities and coronary disease in autopsy. ECG abnormalities irrelevant to coronary artery diseases are common in methadone-related mortalities. Methadone toxicity may affect myocardium and play a role in death. Further prospective studies to evaluate other cardiac indices in methadone-poisoned patients are recommended. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Computerized interpretation of the electrocardiogram (ECG) began in the 1950s when conversion of its analog signal to digital form became available. Since then, automatic computer interpretations of the ECG have become routine, even at the point of care, by the addition of interpretive algorithms to portable ECG carts. Now, more than 100 million computerized ECG interpretations are recorded yearly in the United States. These interpretations have contributed to medical care by reducing physician reading time and accurately interpreting most normal ECGs. But errors do occur. The computer cannot be held responsible for misinterpretations due to recording errors, such as muscle artifacts or lead reversal. But, in many abnormal ECGs, the computer makes its own errors—sometimes critical—in its incorrect detection of arrhythmias, pacemakers, and myocardial infarctions. These errors require that all computerized statements be over-read by trained physicians who have the advantage of clinical context, unavailable to the computer. Together, the computer and over-readers now provide the most accurate ECG interpretations available. © 2018

AB  - Objective: Cerebrovascular reactivity (CR) is a mechanism that maintains stable blood flow supply to the brain. Pressure reactivity index (PRx), the correlation coefficient between slow waves of invasive arterial blood pressure (ABP) and intracranial pressure (ICP) has been validated for CR assessment. However, in clinical ward, not every subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) patient has invasive ABP monitoring. Pulse transit time (PTT), the propagation time of a pulse wave travelling from the heart to peripheral arteries, has been suggested as a surrogate measure of ABP. In this study, we proposed to use PTT instead of invasive ABP to monitor CR. Approach: Forty-five SAH patients with simultaneous recordings of invasive ABP, ICP, oxygen saturation level (SpO2) and electrocardiograph (ECG) were included. PTT was calculated as the time from the ECG R-wave peak to the onset of SpO2. PTT based pressure reactivity index (tPRx) was calculated as the correlation coefficient between slow waves of PTT and ICP. Wavelet tPRx (wtRx) was calculated as the cosine of wavelet phase shift between PTT and ICP. Meanwhile, PRx and wPRx were also calculated using invasive ABP and ICP as input. Main results: The result showed a negative relationship between PTT and ABP (r = -0.58, p < 0.001). tPRx negatively correlated with PRx (r = -0.51, p = 0.003). Wavelet method correlated well with correlation method demonstrated through positive relationship between wPRx and PRx (r = 0.82, p < 0.001) as well as wtPRx and tPRx (r = 0.84, p < 0.001). Significance: PTT demonstrates great potential as a useful tool for CR assessment when invasive ABP is unavailable. Key points • Pulse transit time (PTT), defined as the propagation time of a pulse wave travelling from the heart to the peripheral arteries, has been proposed as a surrogate measure of ABP. The relationship between PTT and ABP in SAH patients remains unknown. • Cerebrovascular reactivity (CR) assessment through PTT has advantages over invasive ABP, as it avoids bleeding and infection risk, and can be used outside of the ICU. • We introduced a new method to assess CR using PTT and ICP through correlation based method and wavelet based method. • We found that beat-to-beat PTT was negatively related with invasive ABP in SAH patients. A significant linear relationship exists between PTT-based CR parameter and a well validated method, PRx. PTT demonstrates great potential as a useful tool for CR assessment when invasive ABP is unavailable in SAH patients. © 2019 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.

AB  - The modern intensive care unit (ICU) contains increasingly numerous, varied and sophisticated equipment for the support and monitoring of critically ill patients. Auditory alarms are most often used in the ICU 'because hearing is a primary warning sense' and has 'generally omni-directional characteristics'. The difficulty of accurate recognition of auditory warnings in the ICU is known to have had fatal consequences; for instance, a patient death attributed to confusion between the ventilator and ECG alarms. The majority of auditory warnings emitted in an ICU are in fact false alarms, triggered by interference. The chapter highlights the problems facing operators of medical equipment and their associated auditory alarms. Two experiments are designed to investigate aspects of the learning, retention and confusion of ICU alarms. Experiment 1 measured the identification of auditory warnings by experienced ICU nurses, using stimulus sounds recorded in their own unit. Experiment 2 examined the effect of urgency mapping on the learning of paired auditory warnings/clinical situations. © Neville A. Stanton and Judy Edworthy 1999. All rights reserved.

AB  - Patients who deteriorate while on the acute care ward and are emergently transferred to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) experience high rates of mortality. To date, risk scores for clinical deterioration applied to the acute care wards rely on static or intermittent inputs of vital sign and assessment parameters. We propose the use of continuous predictive analytics monitoring, or data that relies on real-time physiologic monitoring data captured from ECG, documented vital signs, laboratory results, and other clinical assessments to predict clinical deterioration. A necessary step in translation to practice is understanding how an alert threshold would perform if applied to a continuous predictive analytic that was trained to detect clinical deterioration. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the positive predictive value of ‘risk spikes’, or large abrupt increases in the output of a statistical model of risk predicting clinical deterioration. We studied 8111 consecutive patient admissions to a cardiovascular medicine and surgery ward with continuous ECG data. We first trained a multivariable logistic regression model for emergent ICU transfer in a test set and tested the characteristics of the model in a validation set of 4059 patient admissions. Then, in a nested analysis we identified large, abrupt spikes in risk (increase by three units over the prior 6 h; a unit is the fold-increase in risk of ICU transfer in the next 24 h) and reviewed hospital records of 91 patients for clinical events such as emergent ICU transfer. We compared results to 59 control patients at times when they were matched for baseline risk including the National Warning Score (NEWS). There was a 3.4-fold higher event rate for patients with risk spikes (positive predictive value 24% compared to 7%, p = 0.006). If we were to use risk spikes as an alert, they would fire about once per day on a 73-bed acute care ward. Risk spikes that were primarily driven by respiratory changes (ECG-derived respiration (EDR) or charted respiratory rate) had highest PPV (30–35%) while risk spikes driven by heart rate had the lowest (7%). Alert thresholds derived from continuous predictive analytics monitoring are able to be operationalized as a degree of change from the person’s own baseline rather than arbitrary threshold cut-points, which can likely better account for the individual’s own inherent acuity levels. Point of care clinicians in the acute care ward settings need tailored alert strategies that promote a balance in recognition of clinical deterioration and assessment of the utility of the alert approach. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Respiratory rate (RR) is one of the most sensitive markers of a deteriorating patient. Despite this, there is significant inter-observer discrepancy when measured by clinical staff, and modalities used in clinical practice such as ECG bioimpedance are prone to error. This study utilized infrared thermography (IRT) to measure RR in a critically ill population in the Intensive Care Unit. This study was carried out in a Single Hospital Centre. Respiratory rate in 27 extubated ICU patients was counted by two observers and compared to ECG Bioimpedance and IRT-derived RR at distances of 0.4–0.6 m and > 1 m respectively. IRT-derived RR using two separate computer vision algorithms outperformed ECG derived RR at distances of 0.4–0.6 m. Using an Autocorrelation estimator, mean bias was − 0.667 breaths/min. Using a Fast Fourier Transform estimator, mean bias was − 1.000 breaths/min. At distances greater than 1 m no statistically significant signal could be obtained. Over all frequencies, there was a significant relationship between the RR estimated using IRT and via manual counting, with Pearson correlation coefficients between 0.796 and 0.943 (p < 0.001). Correlation between counting and ECG-derived RR demonstrated significance only at > 19 bpm (r = 0.562, p = 0.029). Overall agreement between IRT-derived RR at distances of 0.4–0.6 m and gold standard counting was satisfactory, and outperformed ECG derived bioimpedance. Contactless IRT derived RR may be feasible as a routine monitoring modality in wards and subacute inpatient settings. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Due to its simplicity and low cost, analyzing an electrocardiogram (ECG) is the most common technique for detecting cardiac arrhythmia. The massive amount of ECG data collected every day, in home and hospital, may preclude data review by human operators/technicians. Therefore, several methods are proposed for either fully automatic arrhythmia detection or event selection for further verification by human experts. Traditional machine learning approaches have made significant progress in the past years. However, those methods rely on hand-crafted feature extraction, which requires in-depth domain knowledge and preprocessing of the signal (e.g., beat detection). This, plus the high variability in wave morphology among patients and the presence of noise, make it challenging for computerized interpretation to achieve high accuracy. Recent advances in deep learning make it possible to perform automatic high-level feature extraction and classification. Therefore, deep learning approaches have gained interest in arrhythmia detection. In this work, we reviewed the recent advancement of deep learning methods for automatic arrhythmia detection. We summarized existing literature from five aspects: utilized dataset, application, type of input data, model architecture, and performance evaluation. We also reported limitations of reviewed papers and potential future opportunities. © 2019

AB  - Arrhythmia is a cardiac condition caused by abnormal electrical activity of the heart, which can be life-Threatening. Electrocardiogram (ECG) is the principal diagnostic tool used to detect arrhythmias or heart abnormalities. It contains information about the different types of arrhythmias. However, due to the complexity and nonlinearity of ECG signals, such as the presence of noise, the time dependence of ECG signals and the irregularity of the heartbeat, it is troublesome to analyse ECG signals manually. Moreover, the interpretation of ECG signals is subjective and might vary among experts in the field. Therefore, an automatic, high-precision ECG recognition method is important to arrhythmia detection. For such, a method is proposed in this paper for arrhythmia classification, which is based on deep learning-based approach long short-Term memory (LSTM), where five classes of arrhythmias as recommended by the Association for Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) are analysed. The method has been tested on the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database with a number of useful performance evaluation measures, showing that is a promising and better performance than other artificial intelligence methods used.

AB  - Heart sounds recognition is essential for heart defects diagnosis. Diagnosis of structural heart defects is not always possible using the contemporary stethoscope and need further assessment using high cost devices such as X-ray, electrocardiogram (ECG), echocardiography (ECHO) and computed tomography (CT)). Automatic computer assisted auscultation may be used as a clinical decision support tool. In an attempt to develop an automatic computer aided diagnostic modality for heart conditions that is sensitive, specific, non-invasive we created two automatic computer cardiac auscultation (ACCA) models that provide heart sound analysis and we aimed to improve the sensitivity and correct classification rate (CCR) of recognition of heart sounds, thus we developed model A ACCA recognition system (machine learning (interpreter independent)) and model B ACCA recognition system (machine learning and interpreter dependent visual analysis). We used machine learning based on mel frequency cepestral coefficients as a feature and Hidden Markov Model (HMM) as a classifier. We performed visual analysis based on phonocardiography (PCG) and spectrogram image. Model A ACCA demonstrated 97% CCR, 99.2% sensitivity and specificity 100% and model B ACCA demonstrated 98.2% CCR and 99.2% sensitivity and specificity 100%. ACCA models A and B allow reliable interpretation of recognised sounds to detect underlying structural defects. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.

AB  - The analysis and interpretation of the ECG signal, mainly considering long monitoring examinations, is fundamental for diagnosing arrhythmias and conduction disturbances. Hence, a reliable assessment for the exam is extremely dependent on the quality of signal recording and the accuracy of extracting all the available features. It is well known that the automatic delineation of ECG characteristic waves and the quantitative analysis of timeseries, waveforms, and amplitudes derived from ECG segmentation behave as challenging tasks, considering both the broad range of observed morphologies and also the inherent noise sensibility. But what kind of metrics are desirable for a beat-to-beat analysis aiming the evaluation of myocardial contraction and heart electrical system? So in this chapter, we will detail the state-of-the-art features, which can be automatically extracted from this biomedical signal for providing useful diagnostic information or even help to predict adverse events. © 2019 João Paulo do Vale Madeiro, Paulo César Cortez, José Maria da Silva Monteiro Filho and Angelo Roncalli Alencar Brayner Published by Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper presents the design, testing and quantitative evaluation of a high-performance, low-power, portable multi-instrument (107×79mm2), capable of recording important biosignals accurately and in real-time. This highly versatile system has the ability to transmit the captured bio-data back to the user either in a wired (HDMI cable) or wireless (ZigBee protocol) manner, depending on the targeted application. The biological information that can be recorded by the proposed instrument spans a wide range of bio-potentials and bio-amperometric signals. The proposed instrument is split into two complementary “sub-instruments” where one is operating as the front-end device, responsible for the accurate, low-noise signal detection and transmission, while the second “sub-instrument” is operating as the “base station” responsible for the collection and further processing of the captured data. For wired transmission (e.g to the user's PC) the front end module can operate independently, however, for wireless transmission both “sub-instruments” are required (transmitter-base station architecture). For wireless transmission, each of the two “sub-instruments” is equipped with dedicated 2 Mbps ZigBee radio transceivers and both parts are controlled by a small area embedded FPGA module. The front-end device features two distinct sections: (a) a current/voltage to voltage section comprising six potentiometry and two transimpedance amplifier-based amperometry channels. These eight in total analogue channels are converted into digital form by means of a 24 bit, voltage input, Analogue-to-Digital Converter (ADC) and (b) a four channel, commercially available switched-capacitor-based ADC Integrated Circuit (IC), which converts input charge to digital data with 16 or 20 bit resolution at 3.125 kSPS. The paper presents a plethora of measured wired and wireless experimental results, corresponding to most well-known biomedical and other biological/physical signals including: EEG, ECoG, EMG, ECG, PPG, intracardiac atrial fibrillation (AF) signals, cell media/tissue biopotential, drosophila H1-cell spiking signals and pH sensing using commercially available electrodes. The portable/wearable poly-instrument is suitable for Intensive Care Unit (ICU), High Dependancy Unit (HDU) as well as home monitoring. © 2018

AB  - Background Recognition of out-of-hospital-cardiac arrests (OHCAs) at emergency medical communication centres is based on questions of OHCA symptoms, resulting in 50-80% accuracy rates. However, OHCAs might be recognized more promptly using 'rhythm-based' recognition, whereby a victim's cardiac rhythm is recorded with mobile phone technology that analyses and transmits recordings to emergency medical communication centres for further interpretation. Objective To examine whether the quality of normal cardiac rhythm and the rhythm with the best prognosis in OHCA, ventricular fibrillation (VF), is sufficient for 'rhythm-based' OHCA recognition when recorded within a mobile phone-sized device. Patients and methods mid-sternum within an area the size of a mobile phone and analysed by automated external defibrillator (AED) software and two cardiologists. The rhythms were categorized as shockable or nonshockable. The cardiologists assessed the quality of the recordings. Results The AED software correctly analysed all normal rhythms and 15 of 22 VF rhythms. The VF duration was too short for automatic detection in seven cases. The cardiologists analysed all the normal rhythms and VF sequences correctly and graded them as high quality. Conclusion The recordings of normal ECG rhythm and VF within an area the size of a mobile phone are of sufficient quality and could be used in 'rhythm-based' OHCA recognition. The VF period was too short for an accurate analysis by the AED software in some cases. © 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Handheld ECG recorders may have algorithms which automatically inform the user of presence of arrhythmia. The main objectives of this study were to evaluate the accuracy of the arrhythmia diagnosis algorithm of Beurer ME90 recorder to diagnose atrial fibrillation (AF)/flutter, and to evaluate whether recording technique (finger versus precordial) affects diagnostic performance. Methods: Consecutive patients admitted at the cardiology ward of a tertiary care hospital were enrolled. Handheld ECG recordings were performed by holding the device between index fingers (lead I), and by applying it to the chest (modified V4, mV4), with 12‑lead ECGs serving as the gold standard for presence of arrhythmia. Results: A total of 127 patients were included. The automatic arrhythmia detection algorithm identified all 16 cases of AF, but specificity was poor (62–77%, with slightly better specificity of mV4 compared to lead I). Specificity improved to 84% (95% CI 76–91%) if both lead I and mV4 recordings had to be positive for diagnosis, with a positive predictive value of 48% (95% CI 30–67%). Interpretation of the tracings by an electrophysiologist was 100% specific. Atrial flutter with regular ventricular response was however missed by automatic and manual interpretation. Conclusions: The automatic arrhythmia algorithm of the BeurerME90 device has excellent sensitivity for diagnosing AF, but with low specificity. Strategies such as first recording lead I (more practical to perform), and in case of arrhythmia detection, confirming with an mV4 recording, may be applied to reduce false positive readings requiring manual confirmation by a healthcare professional. © 2018

AB  - The convergence between wearable and medical device technologies is a natural progression. Miniaturization has allowed the design of small, compact monitoring systems that can record physiological signals over longer periods of time. Thus, the potential for these devices to expand the understanding of disease progression and patients' clinical status is very high. The accuracy of these devices, however, is dependent upon the computer algorithms utilized in the analysis of the large volume of physiological data monitored and/or recorded by the devices. Automated interpretation of the data by these new technologies, therefore, necessitates closer examination by regulatory organizations. The current requirements for the validation of novel Ambulatory ECG (A-ECG) annotation algorithms are based on the AAMI/ANSI-EC57 and IEC60601-2-47 Standard. These standards are being updated, but they rely on a very limited set of digitized ECG recordings from a couple of ECG databases built in the first half of the 70's. These reference signals are obsolete. We are developing a validation tool for computerized methods designed to detect and monitor cardiac activities based on body-surface ECGs. We will rely on a set of existing digital high-resolution 12‑lead A-ECG recordings acquired in cardiac patients and healthy individuals. These ECG signals include a large and unique set of electrocardiographic events. This tool is being qualified by the Center for Devices and Radiological Health of the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a Medical Device Development Tool (MDDT). This document provides insights into the design of the M.A.D.A.E. database, its functionalities, and its ultimate role in enabling the next generations of automatic interpretation of ECG signals. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The authors wish to make the following corrections to our published paper [1]. The scores, shown in the last column of Table 3, refer to the follow-up phase of the CinC 2017 challenge, and may have been obtained with methods and features different from those shown in columns 3 and 2, which refer to Challenge phase and are described in the cited articles published on CinC 2017 Proceedings. In particular: The score F1 = 0.848 of Teijero et al. was obtained not using 79 features, as shown in the table, but 42 features and the score F1 = 0.8278 of Plesinger et al. was obtained using not 277, but 60 features. These data are extracted from their recently published articles on Physiological Measurements. Furthermore, it must be specified that the applied classification method of Teijero et al. is not a Recurrent Neural Network, but an ensemble of a Gradient Boosting classifier and a Recurrent Neural Network. As for the other two items in the table (Kropf et al., Datta et al.), we have no information on any changes in the follow-up respect to the challenge phase. In summary, on page 9, Table 3 should be changed from: Table 3. Comparison of the results of the proposed methods with that of the other algorithms proposed for the Physionet Challenge 2017 obtained in the follow-up phase. (Table presented)to the following correct version: (Table Presented). On page 14, reference 40 and reference 43 should be changed from: 40.

AB  - Watermarking is currently investigated as an efficient and safe method of embedding additional patient or environment-related data into the electrocardiogram. This paper presents experimental work on the assessment of the loss of ECG (electrocardiogram signal) diagnostic quality from the industrial standard EN60601-2-25:2015 point of view. We implemented an original time-frequency watermarking technique with an adaptive beat-to-beat lead-independent data container design. We tested six wavelets, six coding bit depth values (including the automatic noise-dependent one) and two types of watermark content to find the conditions that are necessary for watermarked ECG to maintain the compliance with International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) requirements for interpretation performance. Unlike other authors, we did not assess the differences of signal values, but errors in ECG wave delineation results. The results of a total of 7300 original and watermarked 10 s ECGs were statistically processed to reveal possible interpretation quality degradation due to watermarking. Finally we found (1) the Symlet of 11-th order as the best of the wavelets that were tested; (2) the important role of ECG wave delineation and noise tracking procedures; (3) the high influence of the watermark-to-noise similarity of amplitude and values distribution and (4) the stability of the watermarking capacity for different heart rates in atrial rhythms. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation is one of the most frequent complications and a major risk of morbidity and mortality after cardiac surgery. Antioxidants such as vitamin C are used for prevention of this arrhythmia. Different results of studies have been reported, but most of them have shown efficiency of vitamin C in prophylaxis of postoperative AF. We tried to examine this efficacy with larger sample size. METHODS: Three hundred and fourteen on pump coronary artery bypass graft surgery alone. Patients were divided into two groups: The intervention group received vitamin C (N = 160) and the control group did not receive any (N = 154). Intervention group was administered two grams of vitamin C intravenously (IV) 24 hours preoperatively, 500 mg every 12 hours IV for 48 hours in ICU, and 500 mg every 12 hours PO for 48 hours in ward. Continuous monitoring in ICU and three times a day ECG was used for AF detection. The two groups were compared. RESULTS: The two groups were matched in terms of age, sex, LA size, ejection fraction, functional class, and TSH level. Of the patients, 244 were male. Mean age was 62 years (40-84 years) in both groups. M/F ratio was four in both groups. Functional class and ejection fraction were the same in both groups. There was no mean TSH level difference. AF occurrence in vitamin C group was 7.6 % and in control group was 7.8 %. There was no difference in ICU or hospital stay. CONCLUSIONS: Prophylactic use of vitamin C does not further reduce postoperative atrial fibrillation in on pump CABG patients.

AB  - Electrocardiography (ECG) is the recording of the electrical activity of the heart with the help of the electrodes placed on the skin. The transmission of the ECG signal is very helpful in the field of Telemedicine. This will help the doctors to view the patient's ECG who is living in the remote region. Other applications are ambulance monitoring, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patient monitoring, home patient monitoring, etc, where Internet of Things (IoT) plays a major role in the transmission of medical data and information. In existing wireless technology like Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM), Satellite, Bluetooth, zigbee, etc., communication of data, installation and other practical difficulties are quite complex. But in IoT even long distance communication is made that much easier when compared to other methods. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - Accurate detection of characteristic electrocardiogram (ECG) waves is necessary for ECG analysis and interpretation. In this paper, we distinguish four processing steps of detection algorithms: noise and artifacts reduction, transformations, fiducial marks selection of wave candidates, and decision rule. Processing steps combinations from several detection algorithms are used to find QRS, P, and T wave peaks. In addition, we consider the search window parameter modification based on waveform templates extracted by heart cycles clustering. The methods are extensively evaluated on two public ECG databases containing QRS, P, and T wave peaks annotations. We found that the combination of morphological mathematical filtering with Elgendi's algorithm works best for QRS detection on MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database (detection error rate (DER = 0.48%, Lead I). The combination of modified Martinez's PT and wavelet transform (WT) methods gave the best results for P wave peaks detection on both databases, when both leads are considered (MIT-BIH arrhythmia database: DER = 32.13%, Lead I, DER = 42.52%, Lead II; QT Database: DER = 21.23%, Lead I, DER = 26.80%, Lead II). Waveform templates in combination with Martinez's WT obtained the best results for T wave peaks detection on QT database (DER = 25.15%, Lead II). This paper demonstrates that combining some of the best proposed methods in literature leads to improvements over the original methods for ECG waves detection while maintaining satisfactory computation times. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Background: Fluoxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) commonly used in the treatment of depression. While most intoxications with SSRI's have favorable outcomes and do not require interventions other than strict observation of vital signs and heart rhythm, clinicians should be aware of the life-threatening complications that may occur. Case presentation: A 61-year-old woman presented to the emergency department after an intentional multiple drug overdose. Upon examination, she was somnolent with stable respiration and hemodynamics. Electrocardiography showed a prolonged QTc interval of 503ms. The patient was admitted to the ICU for cardiopulmonary monitoring. During admission, the patient remained stable and showed improved neurologic function over time. After 22h, a second ECG showed normalization of the QTc interval to 458ms. However, 36 to 40h after admission, our patient developed recurrent episodes of Torsades de Pointes (TdP) with loss of cardiac output, leading to cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Spontaneous circulation was restored after intravenous administration of magnesium sulphate. Retrospective serum analysis revealed fluoxetine concentrations of 2700mcg/l. Conclusion: Most intoxications with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) have favorable outcomes and do not require medical interventions other than strict cardiopulmonary observation. However, higher doses have been associated with QTc interval prolongation, TdP, serotonin syndrome, and death. This case illustrates that life-threatening complications may occur late in the course of hospital admission. Even though overdoses with SSRI's generally result in few fatalities, clinicians should be aware of the life-threatening clinical manifestations that may occur. Despite being an imperfect predictor of imminent TdP, continuous monitoring of cardiac rhythm is strongly recommended when either cardiac or non-cardiac symptoms are present. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Cardiac arrhythmia can lead to morbidity and mortality and is a substantial economic burden. Electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring is widely used to detect arrhythmia. The number of ECG recordings is increasing due to aging populations and availability of easy-to-use wearable devices. Manual interpretation of the high volume of recorded ECGs might not be a feasible and scalable solution. Therefore, machine learning algorithms are widely used for automatic ECG interpretation. In this paper, the challenges and differences between machine learning techniques for ECG monitoring and interpretation are reviewed, from traditional machine learning classifiers to deep learning and their combination. © 2018 Creative Commons Attribution.

AB  - T-wave alternans (TWA) is an every-other-beat fluctuation of the T-wave amplitude, often at microvolt (invisible) levels. It is recognized as an important risk index of severe ventricular arrhythmias, leading sometimes to sudden cardiac arrest. Many algorithms for automatic detection and quantification of TWA have been proposed; when applied to the same electrocardiogram (ECG), they may provide a different TWA quantification, making interpretation of differences difficult. Aim of this work is to propose TWA Simulator as a useful tool to validate and compare TWA identification methods. TWA Simulator is a user-friendly MATLAB graphical user interface (GUI) able to generate, model, visualize and store simulated ECG (SECG) affected by TWA of known morphology and amplitude. SECG is constructed by a N-fold repetition of a template, constituted by a real and clean ECG beat. Both number of beats and RR inter-beat variability can be set by the user. Both direct and inverted TWA can be simulated. Direct TWA is simulated by adding a waveform (among four possibility) to every other T wave; inverted TWA is simulated by changing T-wave polarity in every-other SECG beat. Availability of TWA Simulator would allow efficient validation and comparison of automatic TWA identification methods by helping interpretation of results. © 2018 Creative Commons Attribution.

AB  - Background: Customizing monitor alarm settings to individual patients can reduce alarm fatigue in intensive care units (ICUs), but has not been widely studied. Objectives: To understand ICU nurses’ approaches to customization of electrocardiographic (ECG) monitor alarms. Methods: A convergent mixed methods study was conducted in 3 ICUs in 1 hospital. Data on the type and frequency of ECG alarm customization were collected from patient monitors (n=298). Nurses’ customization clinical reasoning was explored through semi-structured interviews (n=27). Results: Of the 298 patients, 58.7% had ≥1 alarm(s) customized. Heart rate limits, irregular heart rate, and atrial fibrillation were the most commonly customized alarms. Interviews revealed that customization practices varied widely and were influenced by factors including clinical expertise, lack of customization education, and negative experiences. Conclusion: Alarm customization is nuanced and requires adequate support to develop safe and effective practices. The challenges identified can inform development of strategies to improve alarm customization. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Objective: This work aims at providing a new method for the automatic detection of atrial fibrillation, other arrhythmia and noise on short single-lead ECG signals, emphasizing the importance of the interpretability of the classification results. Approach: A morphological and rhythm description of the cardiac behavior is obtained by a knowledge-based interpretation of the signal using the Construe abductive framework. Then, a set of meaningful features are extracted for each individual heartbeat and as a summary of the full record. The feature distributions can be used to elucidate the expert criteria underlying the labeling of the 2017 PhysioNet/CinC Challenge dataset, enabling a manual partial relabeling to improve the consistency of the training set. Finally, a tree gradient boosting model and a recurrent neural network are combined using the stacking technique to provide an answer on the basis of the feature values. Main results: The proposal was independently validated against the hidden dataset of the Challenge, achieving a combined F 1 score of 0.83 and tying for the first place in the official stage of the Challenge. This result was even improved in the follow-up stage to 0.85 with a significant simplification of the model, attaining the highest score so far reported on the hidden dataset. Significance: The obtained results demonstrate the potential of Construe to provide robust and valuable descriptions of temporal data, even with the presence of significant amounts of noise. Furthermore, the importance of consistent classification criteria in manually labeled training datasets is emphasized, and the fundamental advantages of knowledge-based approaches to formalize and validate those criteria are discussed. © 2018 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.

AB  - Objective: To classify shock, using ultrasonography as the modality of choice for imaging and to assess the diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound as a tool to classify shock. Design: Prospective study. Setting: KEM Hospital, Pune in the ICU (Intensive care unit). Study Population: 100 patients admitted to the ICU with undifferentiated shock. Methods: Bedside ultrasound examination was performed within 1 hour of admission to the ICU. These patients were also evaluated clinically and biochemically to confirm the type of shock. All patients immediately received standard diagnostic emergent interventions including physical examination, intravenous access for whole blood assays, arterial gas analysis, electrocardiography, continuous cardiac monitoring, supplemental oxygen and chest radiograph. Clinical parameters, urine output, ECG and biochemical tests were performed within 12 hours of USG. Additional investigations were performed wherever required. The ultrasonographic diagnoses were compared with the respective final clinical diagnoses by employing the Cohen kappa inter-rater coefficient of agreement. In addition, various ultrasound parameters were also analyzed to assess the best predictors for each type of shock. Results: The ultrasound diagnosis showed an overall good agreement (Cohen's kappa coefficient > or = 0.6) with the final clinical diagnosis, in identifying the type of shock, in the emergency setting, when ultrasound was done within 1 hour after admission to the ICU. In our study, ultrasound showed maximum sensitivity, specificity, negative and positive predictive values in the setting of obstructive shock. In addition, perfect agreement was seen between the ultrasound and clinical diagnosis, with a Cohen kappa coefficient of 1 in obstructive shock. The least sensitivity, specificity, negative and positive predictive values of ultrasound were seen in the setting of distributive shock. Least agreement between the ultrasound and clinical diagnosis was also seen in distributive shock, as most ultrasound findings were found to overlap with those in the other types of shock. (Cohen kappa coefficient of 0.6). Conclusion: Ultrasonography carried out within 1 hour of admission to the ICU plays a major role in correct diagnosis of the type of shock and subsequent patient management. The best ultrasonographic predictors for diagnosis of each type of shock, can help the clinician to start timely specific interventions in critical care settings for each type of shock. © Journal of the Association of Physicians of India 2011.

AB  - Background: A challenge in ICU EEG interpretation is identifying subclinical status epilepticus versus patterns on the ictal–interictal continuum versus other repetitive patterns. In the electrically noisy intensive care unit, identifying and eliminating interference and artifact allow accurate diagnoses from the EEG, avoiding unnecessary treatment or sedation. Methods: We present a case during Impella (Abiomed Inc, Danvers, MA) continuous flow left ventricular assist device use where the EEG artifact was initially misinterpreted as seizure by the resident and treated as status epilepticus because of the “focal” sharply contoured repetitive pattern. During percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), an 88-year-old developed ventricular tachycardia followed by ventricular fibrillation requiring chest compressions for 10 min, multiple defibrillations, and treatment with epinephrine, amiodarone, calcium, bicarbonate, and magnesium. The patient had an Impella placed during PCI with therapeutic hypothermia initiated after the cardiopulmonary arrest. His neurological exam demonstrated preserved pupillary, corneal, gag and cough reflexes and spontaneous respirations. Results: Long-term video EEG monitoring is included in our institution’s hypothermia protocol. Initial baseline EEG performed 2 h after PCI showed a persistent rhythmic sharp discharge from the left central temporal region resembling left hemisphere status epilepticus. The sharp waves have an alternating repeating 2:1 relationship with the EKG rhythm strip. This is best seen in the left hemisphere, which we posit is related to the Impella’s positioning across the aortic valve pointing toward the patient’s left side. A chest x-ray confirmed the device’s position immediately before EEG monitoring. Arterial pressure tracings were not available in the chart. Conclusions: There is a low-amplitude spiky artifact; however, there was no pacing at that time. It is possible that synergistic flow with systole/diastole reinforced the pulsatility with movement of the Impella, resulting in the alternating pattern. The patient’s hemodynamic instability precluded extensive troubleshooting with the Impella device, but after EEG repositioning, the artifact was eliminated. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature and Neurocritical Care Society.

AB  - With the improvement of medical data capturing, vast amount of continuous patient monitoring data, e.g., electrocardiogram (ECG), real-time vital signs and medications, become available for clinical decision support at intensive care units (ICUs). However, it becomes increasingly challenging to model such data, due to high density of the monitoring data, heterogeneous data types and the requirement for interpretable models. Integration of these high-density monitoring data with the discrete clinical events (including diagnosis, medications, labs) is challenging but potentially rewarding since richness and granularity in such multimodal data increase the possibilities for accurate detection of complex problems and predicting outcomes (e.g., length of stay and mortality). We propose Recurrent Attentive and Intensive Model (RAIM) for jointly analyzing continuous monitoring data and discrete clinical events. RAIM introduces an efficient attention mechanism for continuous monitoring data (e.g., ECG), which is guided by discrete clinical events (e.g, medication usage). We apply RAIM in predicting physiological decompensation and length of stay in those critically ill patients at ICU. With evaluations on MIMIC-III Waveform Database Matched Subset, we obtain an AUC-ROC score of 90.18% for predicting decompensation and an accuracy of 86.82% for forecasting length of stay with our final model, which outperforms our six baseline models. © 2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - Medical emergencies are life-threatening situations which need immediate interventions. Response to such emergency situation will depend upon the resources available at that instant. A response time of any healthcare system will make a difference between life and death of a victim. In this work, the authors investigated the performance of various routing protocols for Ad Hoc network application in healthcare services for emergency situations where the data from the patients were collected via wearable devices. The comparison study is done to test the suitability of the Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols for such m-health applications established through an ad hoc network. The established network, however, diagnoses the patient’s parameters on real-time basis and sends the data to the doctors and to a database within the hospital, which is constantly monitored, creating a virtual Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for a victim so as to address any abnormal behaviour during remote process. The proposed architecture was designed with the aim to manage emergency situations by reducing delays and increase the effectiveness of the patient monitoring mechanism in situations where the delay in providing medical aid to the patient maked a difference to his/her survival. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the study, an Electrocardiogram (ECG) pattern of a patient was monitored on real-time basis. A custom packet frame was designed for data transmission having a special field to store ECG data along with other general information as per the packet standards. © 2018 Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.

AB  - Aim: To study the influence of patient characteristics and unit ergonomics and human factors on the time to initiation of CPR. Methods: A single center study of children, 0 to 21 years old, admitted to an ICU who experienced cardiopulmonary arrest (CPA) requiring &gt;1 min of chest compressions. Time of CPA was determined by analysis of continuous ECG, plethysmography, arterial blood pressure, and end-tidal CO2 (EtCO2) waveforms. Initiation of CPR was identified by the onset of cyclic artifact in the ECG waveform. Patient characteristics and unit ergonomics and human factors were examined including CPA cause, identification on the High-Risk Checklist (HRC), existing monitoring, ICU type, time of day, nursing shift change, and outcome. Results: The median time from CPA to initiation of CPR was 50.5 s (IQR 26.5 to 127.5) in 36 CPAs. Forty-seven percent of patients experienced time from CPA to initiation of CPR of &gt;1 min. There was no difference in CPA cause, ICU type, time of day, or nursing shift change. Conclusion: Nearly half of pediatric patients who experienced CPA in an ICU setting did not meet AHA guidelines for early initiation of CPR. This is an opportunity to study the recognition phase of CPA using continuous monitoring data with the aim of improving the understanding of and factors contributing to delays in initiation of CPR. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Objective: We developed an image-based electrocardiographic (ECG) quality assessment technique that mimics how clinicians annotate ECG signal quality. Methods: We adopted the structural similarity measure (SSIM) to compare images of two ECG records that are obtained from displaying ECGs in a standard scale. Then, a subset of representative ECG images from the training set was selected as templates through a clustering method. SSIM between each image and all the templates were used as the feature vector for the linear discriminant analysis classifier. We also employed three commonly used ECG signal quality index (SQI) measures: baseSQI, kSQI, and sSQI to compare with the proposed image quality index (IQI) approach. We used 1926 annotated ECGs, recorded from patient monitors, and associated with six different ECG arrhythmia alarm types which were obtained previously from an ECG alarm study at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). In addition, we applied the templates from the UCSF database to test the SSIM approach on the publicly available PhysioNet Challenge 2011 data. Results: For the UCSF database, the proposed IQI algorithm achieved an accuracy of 93.1% and outperformed all the SQI metrics, baseSQI, kSQI, and sSQI, with accuracies of 85.7%, 63.7%, and 73.8% respectively. Moreover, evaluation of our algorithm on the PhysioNet data showed an accuracy of 82.5%. Conclusion : The proposed algorithm showed better performance for assessing ECG signal quality than traditional signal processing methods. Significance: A more accurate assessment of ECG signal quality can lead to a more robust ECG-based diagnosis of cardiovascular conditions. © 1964-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Objective: This paper aims to prove that automatic beat classification on ECG signals can be effectively solved with a pure knowledge-based approach, using an appropriate set of abstract features obtained from the interpretation of the physiological processes underlying the signal. Methods: A set of qualitative morphological and rhythm features are obtained for each heartbeat as a result of the abductive interpretation of the ECG. Then, a QRS clustering algorithm is applied in order to reduce the effect of possible errors in the interpretation. Finally, a rule-based classifier assigns a tag to each cluster. Results: The method has been tested with the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database records, showing a significantly better performance than any other automatic approach in the state-of-the-art, and even improving most of the assisted approaches that require the intervention of an expert in the process. Conclusion: The most relevant issues in ECG classification, related to a large extent to the variability of the signal patterns between different subjects and even in the same subject over time, will be overcome by changing the reasoning paradigm. Significance: This paper demonstrates the power of an abductive framework for time-series interpretation to make a qualitative leap in the significance of the information extracted from the ECG by automatic methods. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings provide insights on a person's cardiac activity, and can be used to identify heartbeat abnormalities, or arrhythmia, they might suffer. Automatic ECG interpretation can be achieved via machine learning techniques to aid physicians. This research aims to model a ECG classifier based on Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Genetic Algorithm (GA) to classify a normal beat and three types of arrhythmia. SVM with radial basis function (RBF) kernel were used because of its superiority in handling the large number of numerical features generated from the ECG. GA was used to enhance the SVM by performing feature selection to generate dataset with optimal number of features, limiting possibilities of feature redundancy. ECG dataset used for model training and testing were obtained from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology-Beth Israel Hospital (MIT-BIH) arrhythmia database. The GA-SVM classifier then was compared to SVM-only classifier to ensure that GA is indeed able to improve the capabilities of SVM. Results show that in classifying six-seconds ECG recording with 120 training data and 20 testing data, GA-SVM yielded better average accuracy of 82.5%, compared to 47% yielded by SVM-only classifier. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - ECG is one of the important physiological parameters and is required for monitoring and diagnosis of common cardiac patients. Nowadays, it is an integrated part of generalized monitoring system in ICU and other critical care units. With the development of sophisticated instrumentation systems and modern signal processing technologies, the monitoring and automation in analysis of acquired data makes clinical decision faster and more reliable. The present article discusses the conventional ECG monitoring methodology and recent technologies used for signal acquisition and processing for ECG analysis. As the signal strength (amplitude, frequency, etc.) is feeble in biosignals like ECG, proper data acquisition hardware should be designed for capturing and further processing for information extraction. With the development of computerized automatic signal processing technologies, it becomes easier to develop a biosignal processing and interpretation system. In this article, the application of modern signal processing tools for electrocardiogram (ECG) signal analysis for classification and detection of rhythmic abnormalities is also discussed. For completeness, basics of the heart and generation and interpretation of ECG are also included along with the present trends toward wireless ECG monitoring and few specialized ECG monitoring applications. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - There has been requirement to evolve a general parallel architecture for concurrently processing Electrocardiogram (ECG) using Wavelet Transform based DSP algorithms. In order to acquire spatial ECG electrical signals, 12 ECG lead channels need to be digitized and concurrently processed by Wavelet Transforms, simultaneously acquiring from all the 12 leads. More over now a day 15 Channel ECG is also under consideration in research, for on-line monitoring of critical patient in an ICU situation, while assessing or monitoring load on heart, during treatment process. In this wavelet transform algorithms, matrix inverse operations using wavelet bases matrix, requiring simultaneous matrix multiplications are involved. In order not to loose, high frequency components of ECG, for signal perception or deviation detection using wavelets, the ECG beat is segmented into 410 cubic splines at 2048bps sample rate, to explore association of ECG deviations to different heart ailments. Each spline has associated wavelet coefficient matrix, computed using bases matrix and incoming Digitized ECG vector matrix. On each of the12 lead ECG channels, there are 410 matrix operations required per channel per beat. These matrix operations are required simultaneously, on all the 12 lead ECG Channels, for concurrent digital signal processing of channels for deviation detection. In this processing, multiple data has to be processed by single instruction or algorithm statement, which leads to SIMD (Signal Instruction Multiple Data) architecture. So, a parallel architecture with 16 Processing Elements (PE) with array multipliers for matrix operations are evolved in this review article for suggesting a general parallel architecture for ECG Wavelet Analysis for Signal Perception and Deviation Detection. Using this general parallel architecture, several Wavelet Transform based algorithms, for signal perception for deviation detection are possible, for associating ECG deviations to different heart ailments and localize the deviation to mechanical functional deviation of the hearts anatomy or muscle for on-line diagnostic purpose. So a complete architecture is evolved for such parallel processing, searching the architectural research space and suggested architecture, illustrating brief part of an algorithm. © 2018, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

AB  - Analysis and evaluation of ECG (Electrocardiogram) signals is one of the important methods used in the determination of heart diseases. Since the interpretation of ECG signals is a time consuming and demanding process for physicians, detailed analysis and interpretation software that gives the same result as the diagnosis of the physician at high rates by interpreting these signals in the computer environment is being developed and its usage is increasing. In this study, automatic detection of Normal Beat (NOR), APC (Atrial Premature Contraction) and PVC (Ventricular Premature Contraction) arrhythmia was studied and it was aimed to catch the points that the physician would avoid from the eye and to facilitate the treatment. In the study, the energy of the pulses was calculated, analyzed with Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and classified according to Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - Classifying arrhythmias can be a tough task for a human being and automating this task is highly desirable. Nevertheless fully automatic arrhythmia classification through Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals is a challenging task when the inter-patient paradigm is considered. For the inter-patient paradigm, classifiers are evaluated on signals of unknown subjects, resembling the real world scenario. In this work, we explore a novel ECG representation based on vectorcardiogram (VCG), called temporal vectorcardiogram (TVCG), along with a complex network for feature extraction. We also fine-tune the SVM classifier and perform feature selection with a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. Results for the inter-patient paradigm show that the proposed method achieves the results comparable to state-of-the-art in MIT-BIH database (53% of Positive predictive (+P) for the Supraventricular ectopic beat (S) class and 87.3% of Sensitivity (Se) for the Ventricular ectopic beat (V) class) that TVCG is a richer representation of the heartbeat and that it could be useful for problems involving the cardiac signal and pattern recognition. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Background The 12-lead Electrocardiogram (ECG) has been used to detect cardiac abnormalities in the same format for more than 70 years. However, due to the complex nature of 12-lead ECG interpretation, there is a significant cognitive workload required from the interpreter. This complexity in ECG interpretation often leads to errors in diagnosis and subsequent treatment. We have previously reported on the development of an ECG interpretation support system designed to augment the human interpretation process. This computerised decision support system has been named ‘Interactive Progressive based Interpretation’ (IPI). In this study, a decision support algorithm was built into the IPI system to suggest potential diagnoses based on the interpreter's annotations of the 12-lead ECG. We hypothesise semi-automatic interpretation using a digital assistant can be an optimal man-machine model for ECG interpretation. Objectives To improve interpretation accuracy and reduce missed co-abnormalities. Methods The Differential Diagnoses Algorithm (DDA) was developed using web technologies where diagnostic ECG criteria are defined in an open storage format, Javascript Object Notation (JSON), which is queried using a rule-based reasoning algorithm to suggest diagnoses. To test our hypothesis, a counterbalanced trial was designed where subjects interpreted ECGs using the conventional approach and using the IPI + DDA approach. Results A total of 375 interpretations were collected. The IPI + DDA approach was shown to improve diagnostic accuracy by 8.7% (although not statistically significant, p-value = 0.1852), the IPI + DDA suggested the correct interpretation more often than the human interpreter in 7/10 cases (varying statistical significance). Human interpretation accuracy increased to 70% when seven suggestions were generated. Conclusion Although results were not found to be statistically significant, we found; 1) our decision support tool increased the number of correct interpretations, 2) the DDA algorithm suggested the correct interpretation more often than humans, and 3) as many as 7 computerised diagnostic suggestions augmented human decision making in ECG interpretation. Statistical significance may be achieved by expanding sample size. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Background: The current significant progress in the use of heart rate variability in the solution of many diagnostic and therapeutic problems is determined by the availability of standardized methods of measurement and physiological interpretation of heart rate variability indices on the one hand and the high technological level of state-of-the-art electronic measuring equipment that is used for automatic registration and computer processing of cardio-signals. Methods: A retrospective analysis of anonymized cardio screening results of 22,433 adult residents of 565 settlements (cities and villages) across all 20 administrative districts of the Khmelnytskyi Region (Ukraine) was conducted to find a statistically significant connection between individual heart rate variability parameters and the age of people. Results: Primary statistical analysis and visualization showed a correlation between the selected heart rate variability parameters and the age and sex of the examined persons. The study found values of the predicted age slightly over estimation versus the actual age for very young test subjects and below estimation for elderly subjects. Conclusion: The use of neural network computations and the modification of the algorithm through the construction of individual training samples for different age intervals, and the creation of individual ensembles of classification neural networks, therefore achieved a prediction of the age of examined persons based on the values of their time and frequency domain heart rate variability indices, with 87% accuracy for women and 85% accuracy for men in the 66–85 years age interval and at least 85% for age groups across the entire sample. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - In view of requirements of low-resource consumption and high-efficiency in real-time Ambulatory Electrocardiograph Diagnosis (AED) applications, a novel Cardiac Arrhythmias Detection (CAD) algorithm is proposed. This algorithm consists of three core modules: an automatic-learning machine that models diagnostic criteria and grades the emergency events of cardiac arrhythmias by studying morphological characteristics of ECG signals and experiential knowledge of cardiologists; a rhythm classifier that recognizes and classifies heart rhythms basing on statistical features comparison and linear discriminant with confidence interval estimation; and an arrhythmias interpreter that assesses emergency events of cardia arrhythmias basing on a two rule-relative interpretation mechanisms. The experiential results on off-line MIT-BIH cardiac arrhythmia database as well as online clinical testing explore that this algorithm has 92.8% sensitivity and 97.5% specificity in average, so that it is suitable for real-time cardiac arrhythmias monitoring. © 2017 World Scientific Publishing Company.

AB  - Telehealthcare has become increasingly popular in clinical practice as a means of providing ubiquitous healthcare through long-term informative interactions and health monitoring. We have delivered a synchronized telehealthcare program since 2009. We have implemented a web-based clinical decision support system with a knowledge-based electrocardiogram (ECG) recognition mechanism as an augmentation service to assist medical practitioners doing decision making in clinical practice. To evaluate the capability and usage limits of this automatic ECG interpretation, the aim of this study was to validate the stability and robustness of proposed mechanism using stress testing through six simulation scenarios. According to experimental results, both of the processing items and processing time augmented steadily by the resource of hardware. Besides, under the cross-validation using 327,058 ECG signals from our telehealthcare program, the recognition classifiers yielded 86.8% accuracy in sinus detection and 88.4% accuracy in atrial fibrillation detection. In the future, this prominent mechanism of automatic ECG interpretation could widely offer high accessibility in the field of medical service. The findings of the present study also encourage and augment further support to implementation of screening and monitoring as part of telehealthcare. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - Background: Charted vital signs and laboratory results represent intermittent samples of a patient’s dynamic physiologic state and have been used to calculate early warning scores to identify patients at risk of clinical deterioration. We hypothesized that the addition of cardiorespiratory dynamics measured from continuous electrocardiography (ECG) monitoring to intermittently sampled data improves the predictive validity of models trained to detect clinical deterioration prior to intensive care unit (ICU) transfer or unanticipated death. Methods and findings: We analyzed 63 patient-years of ECG data from 8,105 acute care patient admissions at a tertiary care academic medical center. We developed models to predict deterioration resulting in ICU transfer or unanticipated death within the next 24 hours using either vital signs, laboratory results, or cardiorespiratory dynamics from continuous ECG monitoring and also evaluated models using all available data sources. We calculated the predictive validity (C-statistic), the net reclassification improvement, and the probability of achieving the difference in likelihood ratio χ2 for the additional degrees of freedom. The primary outcome occurred 755 times in 586 admissions (7%). We analyzed 395 clinical deteriorations with continuous ECG data in the 24 hours prior to an event. Using only continuous ECG measures resulted in a C-statistic of 0.65, similar to models using only laboratory results and vital signs (0.63 and 0.69 respectively). Addition of continuous ECG measures to models using conventional measurements improved the C-statistic by 0.01 and 0.07; a model integrating all data sources had a C-statistic of 0.73 with categorical net reclassification improvement of 0.09 for a change of 1 decile in risk. The difference in likelihood ratio χ2 between integrated models with and without cardiorespiratory dynamics was 2158 (p value: &lt;0.001). Conclusions: Cardiorespiratory dynamics from continuous ECG monitoring detect clinical deterioration in acute care patients and improve performance of conventional models that use only laboratory results and vital signs. © 2017 Moss et al.

AB  - Electrocardiogram (ECG) is a well-known diagnostic tool, which is applied by cardiologists to diagnose cardiac disorders. Despite the simple shape of the ECG, various informative measures are included in each recording, which causes complexity for cardiac specialists to recognize the heart problem. Recent studies have concentrated on designing automatic decision-making systems to assist physicians in ECG interpretation and detecting the disorders using ECG signals. This paper applies one optimization algorithm known as Kinetic Gas Molecule Optimization (KGMO) that is based on swarm behavior of gas molecules to train a feedforward neural network for classification of ECG signals. Five types of ECG signals are used in this work including normal, supraventricular, brunch bundle block, anterior myocardial infarction (Anterior MI), and interior myocardial infarction (Interior MI). The classification performance of the proposed KGMO neural network (KGMONN) was evaluated on the Physiobank database and compared against conventional algorithms. The obtained results show the proposed neural network outperformed the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and back propagation (BP) neural networks, with the accuracy of 0.85 and a Mean Square Error (MSE) of less than 20% for the training and test sets. The swarm based KGMONN provides a successful approach for detection of heart disorders with efficient performance. © 2016 TSI® Press.

AB  - Objectives High frequency QRS (HFQRS) analysis has been shown to be an accurate marker for myocardial ischemia. Our objective was to test the use of HFQRS in diagnosing ACS in the emergency department. Methods 324 patients presenting to the ED with chest pain were enrolled. Resting ECG was recorded and later analyzed by an HFQRS algorithm. Results were compared to the conventional ECG diagnosis by 3 independent interpretations: treating physician, expert cardiologist and an automated computer program. Results The HFQRS analysis demonstrated improved sensitivity (67.5%) for the NSTE-ACS group compared to the human interpreters (59.7% and 53.2% for the treating physician and cardiologist respectively) with similar specificity. The automatic program had significantly lower sensitivity (31%) with a higher specificity (77%). Conclusions HFQRS which has shown great promise in diagnosing stable CAD may also be helpful in the ED for diagnosing ACS. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Generally in hospitals, intensive care units (ICUs) have high rates of false arrhythmia alarms independent of their brands and prices. These falsely issued alarms disrupt patients' rest, drain hospital resources, and desensitize the hospital staff to potential emergency situations, which is named as 'false alarm fatigue'. It has been estimated that 43% of life threatening electrocardiogram (ECG) alarms issued by bedside monitors are false, with some categories of alarm being as high as 90%. In our study, we consider the alarms triggered by four life threatening conditions. These alarms are usually triggered by ECG and pulsatile waveforms recorded by monitoring equipment, which have standard alarm triggering criteria such as instantaneous thresholds on the predictor values. Most of the ICU false alarms are caused by single channel artifacts. In this study, we aim to fuse ECG features with information from other independent signals and get more robust alarm algorithms for ICUs. Pulsatile waveforms, which are highly correlated signals, can be used to corroborate the alarm category and to suppress significant number of false ECG alarms in ICUs. Photoplethysmogram (PPG), arterial blood pressure (ABP) or both PPG and ABP can be used for this purpose. These waveformsare the least noisy pressure signal available in certain ICUs and rarely contain ECG-related artifacts. We implement four different algorithms that use information from ECG, PPG and ABP waveforms, and compare the results. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - Background: The Electrocardiogram ECG is one of the most important non-invasive tools for cardiac diseases diagnosis. Taking advantage of the developed telecommunication infrastructure, several approaches that address the development of telemetry cardiac devices were introduced recently. Telemetry ECG devices allow easy and fast ECG monitoring of patients with suspected cardiac issues. Choosing the right device with the desired working mode, signal quality, and the device cost are still the main obstacles to massive usage of these devices. Methods: In this paper, we introduce design, implementation, and validation of a multi-purpose telemetry system for recording, transmission, and interpretation of ECG signals in different recording modes. The system consists of an ECG device, a cloud-based analysis pipeline, and accompanied mobile applications for physicians and patients. The proposed ECG device's mechanical design allows laypersons to easily record post-event short-term ECG signals, using dry electrodes without any preparation. Moreover, patients can use the device to record long-term signals in loop and holter modes, using wet electrodes. In order to overcome the problem of signal quality fluctuation due to using different electrodes types and different placements on subject's chest, customized ECG signal processing and interpretation pipeline is presented for each working mode. Results: We present the evaluation of the novel short-term recorder design. Recording of an ECG signal was performed for 391 patients using a standard 12-leads golden standard ECG and the proposed patient-activated short-term post-event recorder. In the validation phase, a sample of validation signals followed peer review process wherein two experts annotated the signals in terms of signal acceptability for diagnosis.We found that 96% of signals allow detecting arrhythmia and other signal's abnormal changes. Additionally, we compared and presented the correlation coefficient and the automatic QRS delineation results of both short-term post-event recorder and 12-leads golden standard ECG recorder. Conclusions: The proposed multi-purpose ECG device allows physicians to choose the working mode of the same device according to the patient status. The proposed device was designed to allow patients to manage the technical requirements of both working modes. Post-event short-term ECG recording using the proposed design provide physicians reliable three ECG leads with direct symptom-rhythm correlation. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Introduction: A high rate of false arrhythmia alarms in the intensive care unit (ICU) leads to alarm fatigue, the condition of desensitization and potentially inappropriate silencing of alarms due to frequent invalid and nonactionable alarms, often referred to as false alarms. Objective: The aim of this study was to identify patient characteristics, such as gender, age, body mass index, and diagnosis associated with frequent false arrhythmia alarms in the ICU. Methods: This descriptive, observational study prospectively enrolled patients who were consecutively admitted to one of five adult ICUs (77 beds) at an urban medical center over a period of 31 days in 2013. All monitor alarms and continuous waveforms were stored on a secure server. Nurse scientists with expertise in cardiac monitoring used a standardized protocol to annotate six clinically important types of arrhythmia alarms (asystole, pause, ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, accelerated ventricular rhythm, and ventricular bradycardia) as true or false. Total monitoring time for each patient was measured, and the number of false alarms per hour was calculated for these six alarm types. Medical records were examined to acquire data on patient characteristics. Results: A total of 461 unique patients (mean age =60±17 years) were enrolled, generating a total of 2,558,760 alarms, including all levels of arrhythmia, parameter, and technical alarms. There were 48,404 hours of patient monitoring time, and an average overall alarm rate of 52 alarms/hour. Investigators annotated 12,671 arrhythmia alarms; 11,345 (89.5%) were determined to be false. Two hundred and fifty patients (54%) generated at least one of the six annotated alarm types. Two patients generated 6,940 arrhythmia alarms (55%). The number of false alarms per monitored hour for patients’ annotated arrhythmia alarms ranged from 0.0 to 7.7, and the duration of these false alarms per hour ranged from 0.0 to 158.8 seconds. Patient characteristics were compared in relation to 1) the number and 2) the duration of false arrhythmia alarms per 24-hour period, using nonparametric statistics to minimize the influence of outliers. Among the significant associations were the following: age ≥60 years (P=0.013; P=0.034), confused mental status (P<0.001 for both comparisons), cardiovascular diagnoses (P<0.001 for both comparisons), electrocardiographic (ECG) features, such as wide ECG waveforms that correspond to ventricular depolarization known as QRS complex due to bundle branch block (BBB) (P=0.003; P=0.004) or ventricular paced rhythm (P=0.002 for both comparisons), respiratory diagnoses (P=0.004 for both comparisons), and support with mechanical ventilation, including those with primary diagnoses other than respiratory ones (P<0.001 for both comparisons). Conclusion: Patients likely to trigger a higher number of false arrhythmia alarms may be those with older age, confusion, cardiovascular diagnoses, and ECG features that indicate BBB or ventricular pacing, respiratory diagnoses, and mechanical ventilatory support. Algorithm improvements could focus on better noise reduction (eg, motion artifact with confused state) and distinguishing BBB and paced rhythms from ventricular arrhythmias. Increasing awareness of patient conditions that apparently trigger a higher rate of false arrhythmia alarms may be useful for reducing unnecessary noise and improving alarm management. © 2017 Harris et al.

AB  - Accurate automatic identification of fiducial points within an ECG is required for the automatic interpretation of this signal. Several methods exist in the literature for automatic ECG segmentation. These algorithms are based on different methodologies and often evaluated with different datasets and protocols, which makes their performance challenging to compare. For this study, nine segmentation algorithms were selected from the literature and evaluated with the same protocol in order to study their performance. One hundred signals from the PhysioNet's QT database were used for this evaluation. Results showed that one of the algorithms based in the discrete wavelet transform achieved sensitivity of 100% when detecting the onset and offset of the QRS complex. An algorithm using the Multi-scale Morphological Derivate achieved sensitivities of 99.81%, 98.17% and 99.56% when detecting the peak, onset and offset respectively of the P-wave. When segmenting the T-wave, an algorithm based on the Phasor transform had a good performance with sensitivities of 97.78%, 97.81% and 95.43% when detecting the peak, onset and offset, respectively. Additionally, probabilistic methods such as Hidden Markov Models had good results due to the fact that they can learn from real signals and adapt to specific conditions. However, these techniques are often computationally more complex and require training. This study could help in selecting optimal algorithms for ECG segmentation when implementing a system for automatic ECG interpretation. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The electrocardiogram (ECG) signal has been widely used to study the physiological substrates of emotion. However, searching for better filtering techniques in order to obtain a signal with better quality and with the maximum relevant information remains an important issue for researchers in this field. Signal processing is largely performed for ECG analysis and interpretation, but this process can be susceptible to error in the delineation phase. In addition, it can lead to the loss of important information that is usually considered as noise and, consequently, discarded from the analysis. The goal of this study was to evaluate if the ECG noise allows for the classification of emotions, while using its entropy as an input in a decision tree classifier. We collected the ECG signal from 25 healthy participants while they were presented with videos eliciting negative (fear and disgust) and neutral emotions. The results indicated that the neutral condition showed a perfect identification (100%), whereas the classification of negative emotions indicated good identification performances (60% of sensitivity and 80% of specificity). These results suggest that the entropy of noise contains relevant information that can be useful to improve the analysis of the physiological correlates of emotion. © 2016 Society for Psychophysiological Research

AB  - Background: In recent years, there has been an overall trend toward using less invasive hemodynamic monitoring in surgical intensive care units. The pulse contour cardiac output monitor (PiCCO) is one of them. Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate our practice of hemodynamic monitoring with PiCCO in the perioperative period. Methods: A retrospective descriptive analysis was performed in a single general surgical intensive care unit (ICU) run by anesthesiologists for the years 2013-2016. We collected information about patients, ICU quality parameters and monitoring equipment available in the ICU. The primary endpoint was the incidence of PiCCO use. Results: Out of 2972 patients admitted to the general surgical ICU in a 4-year period, besides basic monitoring with electrocardiography (ECG), pulse oximetry and blood pressure monitoring, more than half of the patients received central venous catheterization (55.1%), less than the half invasive arterial catheterization (44.1 %) and only a small proportion PiCCO (0.91%). No patient received a pulmonary arterial catheter. Mortality rate was 7.47 %. Conclusion: The use of PiCCO in our ICU is far below reported in literature. In the majority of cases, our anesthesiologists make clinical decisions based on measurement of central venous and invasive arterial pressure. © 2017, Pharmamed Mado Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background and objective The first-order high-pass filter (AC coupling) has previously been shown to affect the ECG for higher cut-off frequencies. We seek to find a systematic deviation in computer measurements of the electrocardiogram when the AC coupling with a 0.05'Hz first-order high-pass filter is used. Methods The standard 12-lead electrocardiogram from 1248 patients and the automated measurements of their DC and AC coupled version were used. We expect a large unipolar QRS-complex to produce a deviation in the opposite direction in the ST-segment. Results We found a strong correlation between the QRS integral and the offset throughout the ST-segment. The coefficient for J amplitude deviation was found to be −0.277'µV/(µV⋅s). Conclusions Potential dangerous alterations to the diagnostically important ST-segment were found. Medical professionals and software developers for electrocardiogram interpretation programs should be aware of such high-pass filter effects since they could be misinterpreted as pathophysiology or some pathophysiology could be masked by these effects. © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd

AB  - The purpose of this research is to localize ECG electrodes from a 3D photo and to reduce electrode misplacement related errors in the ECG interpretation. A Kinect camera is used to take a 3D photo, which is registered automatically to a model derived from MRI/CT(MC). The registration algorithms use a sternum marker attached to the skin to enable an accurate and fast matching of the 3D photo and the MC model. The algorithms have been compared to optimal manual registration. For all cases the automatic registration algorithms performed much better than the manual registration. The automatic registration of a 3D photo with patient specific electrode positions will offer a novel way of preventing and correcting errors due to ECG lead misplacement. © 2017 IEEE Computer Society.

AB  - Generally in hospitals, intensive care units (ICUs) have high rates of false arrhythmia alarms independent of their brands and prices. These falsely issued alarms disrupt patients rest, drain hospital resources, and desensitize the hospital staff to potential emergency situations, which is named as false alarm fatigue. It has been estimated that 43% of life threatening electrocardiogram (ECG) alarms issued by bedside monitors are false, with some categories of alarm being as high as 90%. In our study, we consider the alarms triggered by four life threatening conditions. These alarms are usually triggered by ECG and pulsatile waveforms recorded by monitoring equipment, which have standard alarm triggering criteria such as instantaneous thresholds on the predictor values. Most of the ICU false alarms are caused by single channel artifacts. In this study, we aim to fuse ECG features with information from other independent signals and get more robust alarm algorithms for ICUs. Pulsatile waveforms, which are highly correlated signals, can be used to corroborate the alarm category and to suppress significant number of false ECG alarms in ICUs. Photoplethysmogram (PPG), arterial blood pressure (ABP) or both PPG and ABP can be used for this purpose. These waveformsare the least noisy pressure signal available in certain ICUs and rarely contain ECG-related artifacts. We implement four different algorithms that use information from ECG, PPG and ABP waveforms, and compare the results. © 2017 IEEE Computer Society. All rights reserved.

AB  - A myriad of data is produced in intensive care units (ICU) even for short periods of time. This data is frequently used for monitoring patient’s immediate health status, not for real-time analysis because of technical challenges in real-time processing of such massive data. Data storage is also another challenge in making ICU data useful for retrospective studies. Therefore, it is important to know the minimal sampling frequency requirement to develop real-time analysis on ICU data and to develop a data storage plan. In this study, we have applied the Probabilistic Symbolic Pattern Recognition (PSPR) method in Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation (PAF) screening problem by analyzing electrocardiogram signals at different sampling frequencies varying from 128 Hz to 8 Hz. Our results show that using PSPR method, we can obtain a classification accuracy of 82.67% in identifying PAF subjects even when the test data is sampled at 8 Hz frequency (73.33% for 128 Hz). This classification accuracy drastically improved to 92% when other descriptive features were used along with PSPR features. The PSPR’s PAF screening ability at low sampling frequency indicates its potential for real-time analysis and wearable embedded computing applications. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.

AB  - Aims Screening for atrial fibrillation (AF) using intermittent electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings can identify individuals at risk of AF-related morbidity in particular stroke. We aimed to validate the performance of an AF screening algorithm compared with manual ECG analysis by specially trained nurses and physicians (gold standard) in 30 s intermittent one-lead ECG recordings. Methods and results The STROKESTOP study is a mass-screening study for AF using intermittent ECG recordings. All individuals in the study without known AF registered a 30-s ECG recording in Lead I two times daily for 2 weeks, and all ECGs were manually interpreted. A computerized algorithm was used to analyse 80 149 ECG recordings in 3209 individuals. The computerized algorithm annotated 87.1% (n = 69 789) of the recordings as sinus rhythm/minor rhythm disturbances. The manual interpretation (gold standard) was that 69 758 ECGs were normal, making the negative predictive value of the algorithm 99.9%. The number of ECGs requiring manual interpretation in order to find one pathological ECG was reduced from 288 to 35. Atrial fibrillation was diagnosed in 84 patients by manual interpretation, in all of whom the algorithm indicated pathology. On an ECG level, 278 ECGs were manually interpreted as AF, and of these the algorithm annotated 272 ECGs as pathological (sensitivity 97.8%). Conclusion Automatic ECG screening using a computerized algorithm safely identifies normal ECGs in Lead I and reduces the need for manual evaluation of individual ECGs with >85% with 100% sensitivity on an individual basis. © 2017 The Author.

AB  - Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia affecting approximately 3 million Americans, and is a prognostic marker for stroke, heart failure and even death. 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) is used to monitor normal sinus rhythm (NSR) and also detect AF in ICU and ambulatory patients. Current techniques to discriminate NSR and AF from single lead ECG suffer several limitations in terms of sensitivity and specificity using short time ECG data which distorts ECG and many are not suitable for real-time implementation. There is a clear need for more robust detection and classification algorithms for clinical applications and specifically for delivering appropriate therapy for implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICD) to provide lifesaving timely action. In this work, the authors propose and demonstrate the application of a multiscale frequency (MSF) technique which takes into account the contribution from various frequencies in ECG and thus yield valuable information regarding the chaotic nature of AF. In this work the authors used AF (25 ECG samples) and NSR (25 ECG samples) traces from publically available Atrial Fibrillation Physionet database for accurate discrimination using MSF approach. The results demonstrate that MSF index is significantly higher (p<0.01) in AF compared to NSR thus enabling robust discrimination. These results offer huge promise for clinical diagnosis of AF from single lead ECG enabling novel treatment strategies in a quick and effective fashion especially in ICD’s as well as for routine monitoring of ambulatory patients. The results also motivate the use of this technique for analysis of other cardiac arrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF).

AB  - Continuous monitoring of critical patients and their biological parameters are transmitted to doctor's console, and doctor's domain address in person using Internet of Things technology (IoT). The design involves measurement of all critical parameters of patients using sensors. Vital parameters measured are temperature, respiration, and pulse rate, humidity and oxygen saturation level using dht11 sensor, MQ sensor, pulse sensor and pulse oximeter sensor. The input sensors are interfaced with an Arduino board and then the signals are transferred to the Raspberry Pi controller and the vital parameters are transmitted to the centralized monitor, where the front end is designed using Lab VIEW software. Using IoT, physicians are notified about the sudden change in patient's condition. The graphical representation of the patient's data is displayed in the doctor's console using Lab VIEW, and the critical readings of the patient are sent to the doctor's domain address through IoT. Thus, critical patients can be monitored by the doctors from wherever they are, enabling more care and attention towards the patient's health by the doctor.

AB  - Background: The most common acquired cause of Long QT syndrome (LQTS) is drug induced QT interval prolongation. It is an electrophysiological entity, which is characterized by an extended duration of the ventricular repolarization. Reflected as a prolonged QT interval in a surface ECG, this syndrome increases the risk for polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (Torsade de Pointes) and sudden death. Method: Bibliographic databases as MEDLINE and EMBASE, reports and drug alerts from several regulatory agencies (FDA, EMEA, ANMAT) and drug safety guides (ICH S7B, ICH E14) were consulted to prepare this article. The keywords used were: polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, adverse drug events, prolonged QT, arrhythmias, intensive care unit and Torsade de Pointes. Such research involved materials produced up to December 2017. Results: Because of their mechanism of action, antiarrhythmic drugs such as amiodarone, sotalol, quinidine, procainamide, verapamil and diltiazem are associated to the prolongation of the QTc interval. For this reason, they require constant monitoring when administered. Other noncardiovascular drugs that are widely used in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), such as ondansetron, macrolide and fluoroquinolone antibiotics, typical and atypical antipsychotics agents such as haloperidol, thioridazine, and sertindole are also frequently associated with the prolongation of the QTc interval. As a consequence, critical patients should be closely followed and evaluated. Conclusion: ICU patients are particularly prone to experience a QTc interval prolongation mainly for two reasons. In the first place, they are exposed to certain drugs that can prolong the repolarization phase, either by their mechanism of action or through the interaction with other drugs. In the second place, the risk factors for TdP are prevalent clinical conditions among critically ill patients. As a consequence, the attending physician is expected to perform preventive monitoring and ECG checks to control the QTc interval. © 2017 Bentham Science Publishers.

AB  - T-wave amplitude (TWA) has been proposed as a marker of the innervation of the myocardium. Until now, TWA has been calculated manually or with poor algorithms, thus making its use not efficient in a clinical environment. We introduce a new wavelet-based algorithm for the delineation QRS complexes and T-waves, and the automatic calculation of TWA. When validated in the MIT/BIH Arrhythmia database, the QRS detector achieved sensitivity and positive predictive value of 99.84% and 99.87%, respectively. The algorithm was validated also on the QT database and it achieved sensitivity of 99.50% for T-peak detection. In addition, the algorithm achieved delineation accuracy that is similar to the differences in delineation between expert cardiologists. We applied the algorithm for the evaluation of the influence in TWA of anticholinergic and antiadrenergic drugs (i.e., atropine and metoprolol) for healthy subjects. We found that the TWA decreased significantly with atropine and that metoprolol caused a significant increase in TWA, thus confirming the clinical hypothesis that the TWA is a marker of the innervation of the myocardium. The results of this paper show that the proposed algorithm can be used as a useful and efficient tool in clinical practice for the automatic calculation of TWA and its interpretation as a non-invasive marker of the autonomic ventricular innervation. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - Background: Non-operative management in majority of paediatric blunt abdominal trauma injuries is routine. The need for pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) admission, length of hospital stay pre and post discharge imaging, duration of activity restriction varies from country to country and center to centre. The purpose of this study was to characterize the pattern of practice in a developing state health institution and formulate safe and effective care plan for managing children with isolated blunt splenic injuries. Method: A retrospective study between 2009-2015 with isolated blunt splenic trauma at our hospital in paediatric population. Result: A total of 40 children (30 male and 10 female) with isolated blunt trauma spleen were included in this study. Age group was between 2.5–16 years (mean 9.5 ± 0.17 years). Fifteen patients were hemodynamically unstable and were resuscitated at reception. Average grade of splenic injury was 2.9. All the patients were admitted in general ward and attached to monitor with heart rate (HR), respiratory rate(RR),electrocardiogram (ECG), blood pressure (B.P) and oxygen saturation (SPO2) monitoring. Average length of hospital stay was 5.5 days (Range 3-11 days). Initial imaging was Ultrasonography (USG) and contrast enhanced computed tomography (CECT) in 18 patients and CECT abdomen only 22 patients. Follow-up imaging was done with USG only in 10 patients (25%) before discharge. Mean observed activity restriction in our study was 5 weeks range (4-8 weeks). All the 40 patients had successful non-operative management without any death or complication. Conclusion; Non-operative management of isolated blunt splenic trauma in paediatric patients was 100% successful in our study. Routine pre-discharge imaging may not be necessary and admission to paediatric ICU might not be mandatory, provided strict hemodynamic monitoring is done. In most isolated splenic injuries 6 weeks activity restriction is safe. © 2017, Scientific Publishers of India. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Hemodynamic instability is frequent and outcome-relevant in critical illness. The understanding of complex hemodynamic disturbances and their monitoring and management plays an important role in treatment of intensive care patients. An increasing number of treatment recommendations and guidelines in intensive care medicine emphasize hemodynamic goals, which go beyond the measurement of blood pressures. Yet, it is not known to which extent the infrastructural prerequisites for extended hemodynamic monitoring are given in intensive care units (ICUs) and how hemodynamic management is performed in clinical practice. Further, it is still unclear which factors trigger the use of extended hemodynamic monitoring. Methods: In this multicenter, 1-day (November 7, 2013, and the preceding 24 h) cross-sectional study, we retrieved data on patient monitoring from ICUs in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland by means of a web-based case report form. One hundred and sixty-one intensive care units contributed detailed information on availability of hemodynamic monitoring. In addition, detailed information on hemodynamic monitoring of 1789 patients that were treated on due date was collected, and independent factors triggering the use of extended hemodynamic monitoring were identified by multivariate analysis. Results: Besides basic monitoring with electrocardiography (ECG), pulse oximetry, and blood pressure monitoring, the majority of patients received invasive arterial (77.9 %) and central venous catheterization (55.2 %). All over, additional extended hemodynamic monitoring for assessment of cardiac output was only performed in 12.3 % of patients, while echocardiographic examination was used in only 1.9 %. The strongest independent predictors for the use of extended hemodynamic monitoring of any kind were mechanical ventilation, the need for catecholamine therapy, and treatment backed by protocols. In 71.6 % of patients in whom extended hemodynamic monitoring was added during the study period, this extension led to changes in treatment. Conclusions: Extended hemodynamic monitoring, which goes beyond the measurement of blood pressures, to date plays a minor role in the surveillance of critically ill patients in German, Austrian, and Swiss ICUs. This includes also consensus-based recommended diagnostic and monitoring applications, such as echocardiography and cardiac output monitoring. Mechanical ventilation, the use of catecholamines, and treatment backed by protocol could be identified as factors independently associated with higher use of extended hemodynamic monitoring. © 2016, The Author(s).

AB  - Objectives: To determine the feasibility of automated co-registration of angiography and intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) to facilitate integration of these two imaging modalities in a synchronous manner. Background: IVUS provides cross-sectional imaging of coronary arteries but lacks overview of the vascular territory provided by angiography. Co-registration of angiography and IVUS would increase utility of IVUS in the clinical setting. Methods: Forty-nine consecutive patients undergoing surveillance for cardiac allograft vasculopathy with angiography and IVUS of the left anterior descending artery (LAD) were enrolled. A pre-IVUS angiogram of the LAD was performed followed by an ECG-triggered fluoroscopy (ECGTF) during IVUS pullback at 0.5 mm/s using an automatic pullback device. ECGTF was used to track the IVUS catheter during pullback and establish a spatial relationship to the pre-IVUS angiogram. Angio-IVUS co-registration was performed with a research prototype (Siemens Healthcare, Germany) and accuracy was evaluated by distance mismatch between angiography and IVUS images at vessel bifurcations. Results: Median age was 54 (44.5, 67) years. The population was 82.6% male with minimal risk factors. The median (IQR) co-registration distance mismatch measured at 108 bifurcations in 42 (85%) patients was 0.35 (0.00–1.16) mm. Seven patients were excluded due to inappropriate data acquisition (n = 3) and failure of tracking (n = 4), e.g., due to overlapping sternal wires. Estimated effective radiation dose for ECGTF was 0.09 mSv. Conclusion: This study demonstrates the feasibility of angio-IVUS co-registration which may be used as a clinical tool for localizing IVUS cross-sections along an angiographic roadmap. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Background: Although premature beats are a matter of concern in horses, the interpretation of equine ECG recordings is complicated by a lack of standardized analysis criteria and a limited knowledge of the normal beat-to-beat variation of equine cardiac rhythm. The purpose of this study was to determine the appropriate threshold levels of maximum acceptable deviation of RR intervals in equine ECG analysis, and to evaluate a novel two-step timing algorithm by quantifying the frequency of arrhythmias in a cohort of healthy adult endurance horses. Results: Beat-to-beat variation differed considerably with heart rate (HR), and an adaptable model consisting of three different HR ranges with separate threshold levels of maximum acceptable RR deviation was consequently defined. For resting HRs <60 beats/min (bpm) the threshold level of RR deviation was set at 20%, for HRs in the intermediate range between 60 and 100 bpm the threshold was 10%, and for exercising HRs >100 bpm, the threshold level was 4%. Supraventricular premature beats represented the most prevalent arrhythmia category with varying frequencies in seven horses at rest (median 7, range 2-86) and six horses during exercise (median 2, range 1-24). Conclusions: Beat-to-beat variation of equine cardiac rhythm varies according to HR, and threshold levels in equine ECG analysis should be adjusted accordingly. Standardization of the analysis criteria will enable comparisons of studies and follow-up examinations of patients. A small number of supraventricular premature beats appears to be a normal finding in endurance horses. Further studies are required to validate the findings and determine the clinical significance of premature beats in horses. © 2016 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Arrhythmia can significantly alter the image quality of cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR); automatic detection and sorting of the most frequent types of arrhythmias during the CMR acquisition could potentially improve image quality. New CMR techniques, such as non-Cartesian CMR, can allow self-gating: from cardiac motion-related signal changes, we can detect cardiac cycles without an electrocardiogram. We can further use this data to obtain a surrogate for RR intervals (valley intervals: VV). Our purpose was to evaluate the feasibility of an automated method for classification of non-arrhythmic (NA) (regular cycles) and arrhythmic patients (A) (irregular cycles), and for sorting of common arrhythmia patterns between atrial fibrillation (AF) and premature ventricular contraction (PVC), using the cardiac motion-related signal obtained during self-gated free-breathing radial cardiac cine CMR with compressed sensing reconstruction (XD-GRASP). Methods: One hundred eleven patients underwent cardiac XD-GRASP CMR between October 2015 and February 2016; 33 were included for retrospective analysis with the proposed method (6 AF, 8 PVC, 19 NA; by recent ECG). We analyzed the VV, using pooled statistics (histograms) and sequential analysis (Poincaré plots), including the median (medVV), the weighted mean (meanVV), the total number of VV values (VVval), and the total range (VVTR) and half range (VVHR) of the cumulative frequency distribution of VV, including the median to half range (medVV/VVHR) and the half range to total range (VVHR/VVTR) ratios. We designed a simple algorithm for using the VV results to differentiate A from NA, and AF from PVC. Results: Between NA and A, meanVV, VVval, VVTR, VVHR, medVV/VVHR and VVHR/VVTR ratios were significantly different (p values = 0.00014, 0.0027, 0.000028, 5×10-9, 0.002, respectively). Between AF and PVC, meanVV, VVval and medVV/VVHR ratio were significantly different (p values = 0.018, 0.007, 0.044, respectively). Using our algorithm, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 93 %, 95 % and 94 % to discriminate between NA and A, and 83 %, 71 %, and 77 % to discriminate between AF and PVC, respectively; areas under the ROC curve were 0.93 and 0.89. Conclusions: Our study shows we can reliably detect arrhythmias and differentiate AF from PVC, using self-gated cardiac cine XD-GRASP CMR. © 2016 The Author(s).

AB  - Automated detection and classification of electrocardiogram (ECG) noise sources can play a crucial role in reliable measurement of ECG parameters for accurate diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) under unsupervised telehealth monitoring and intensive care unit (ICU) applications. Although the methods had quite acceptable detection rates, most methods are too complicated for real-time implementation for wearable cardiac health monitoring devices. Therefore, in this paper, we present a low-complexity algorithm for automatically detecting and classifying the ECG noises including flat line (FL), time-varying noise (TVN), baseline wander (BW), abrupt change (ABC), muscle artifact (MA) and power line interference (PLI). The proposed method is based on the moving average (MAv) and derivative filters and the five temporal features including turning points, global and local amplitude estimates, zerocrossing and autocorrelation peak values. The proposed method is tested and validated using a wide variety of clean and noisy ECG signals taken from the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database and Physionet Challenge database. The method achieves an average sensitivity (Se) of 98.55%, positive productivity (+P) of 95.27% and overall accuracy (OA) of 94.19% for classifying the noises. Results show that the proposed method outperforms the other existing methods. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - Introduction: Patients in the intensive care unit are vulnerable to myocardial injury from a variety of causes, both ischaemic and non-ischaemic. It is challenging for ICU clinicians to apply the conventional guidance concerning diagnosis and treatment. We conducted this review to examine the evidence concerning diagnosis and treatment of myocardial infarction in the ICU. Methods: A systematic review was performed to identify relevant studies. Results: 19 studies concerning use of ECG, cardiac enzymes, echocardiography and angiography were identified. 4 studies considered treatment of myocardial infarction. Conclusions: Regular 12 lead ECG or 12 lead ECG monitoring is more sensitive than 2 lead monitoring, regular measurement of cardiac enzymes is more sensitive than when provoked by symptoms. Coronary angiography rarely identifies treatable lesions, without regional wall motion abnormality on echocardiography. Evidence relating to treatment was limited. A potential strategy to diagnose myocardial infarctions in the ICU is proposed. © 2016, © The Intensive Care Society 2016.

AB  - Background Most patients presenting with suspected acute coronary syndrome (ACS) are admitted to telemetry units. While telemetry is an appropriate level of care, acute complications requiring a higher level of care in the intensive care unit (ICU) occur. Purpose Among patients admitted to telemetry for suspected ACS, we determine the frequency of unplanned ICU transfer, and examine whether ECG changes indicative of myocardial ischemia, and/or symptoms preceded unplanned transfer. Method This was a secondary analysis from a study assessing occurrence rates for transient myocardial ischemia (TMI) using a 12-lead Holter. Clinicians were blinded to Holter data as it was used in the context research; off-line analysis was performed post discharge. Hospital telemetry monitoring was maintained as per hospital protocol. TMI was defined as >1 mm ST-segment ↑ or ↓, in >1 ECG lead, >1 minute. Symptoms were assessed by chart review. Results In 409 patients (64 ± 13 years), most were men (60%), Caucasian (93%), and had a history of coronary artery disease (47%). Unplanned transfer to the ICU occurred in 9 (2.2%), was equivalent by gender, and age (no transfer 64 ± 13 years vs transfer 67 ± 11 years). Four patients were transferred following unsuccessful percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) attempt, four due to recurrent angina, and one due to renal and hepatic failure. Mean time from admission to transfer was 13 ± 6 hours, mean time to ECG detected ischemia was 6 ± 5 hours, and 8.8 ± 5 hours for symptoms prompting transfer. In two patients ECG detected ischemia and acute symptoms prompting transfer were simultaneous. In five patients, ECG detected ischemia was clinically silent. All patients eventually had symptoms that prompted transfer to the ICU. In all nine patients, there was no documentation or nursing notes regarding bedside ECG monitor changes prior to unplanned transfer. Hospital length of stay was longer in the unplanned transfer group (2 days ± 2 versus 6 days ± 4; p = 0.018). Conclusions In patients with suspected ACS, while unplanned transfer from telemetry to ICU is uncommon, it is associated with prolonged hospitalization. Two primary scenarios were identified; (1) following unsuccessful PCI, and (2) recurrent angina. Symptoms prompting unplanned transfer occurred, but happened on average 8.8 hours after hospital admission; whereas ECG detected ischemia preceding unplanned transfer occurred on average 6 hours after hospital admission. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - An automated patient-specific system to classify the level of sedation in ICU patients using heart rate variability signal is presented in this paper. ECG from 70 mechanically ventilated adult patients with administered sedatives in an ICU setting were used to develop a support vector machine based system for sedation depth monitoring using several heart rate variability measures. A leave-one-subject-out cross validation was used for classifier training and performance evaluations. The proposed patient-specific system provided a sensitivity, specificity and an AUC of 64%, 84.8% and 0.72, respectively. It is hoped that with the help of additional physiological signals the proposed patient-specific sedation level prediction system could lead to a fully automated multimodal system to assist clinical staff in ICUs to interpret the sedation level of the patient. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - Alarm fatigue in intensive care units (ICU) is one of the top healthcare issues in the US. False alarms in ICU will decrease the quality of care and staff response time over the alarms. Normally, false alarm will cause desensitization of the clinical staff which leads to warnings and misleading, if the triggered alarm is true. In this study, we have proposed a multi-model ensemble approach to reduce the false alarm rate in monitoring systems. We have used 750 patient records from PhysioNet database. At First arrhythmia based features from electrocardiogram (ECG), arterial blood pressure (ABP) and photoplethysmogram (PPG) features were extracted from the records. Next, the dataset has been separated into two subsets on the basis of available features information. The first dataset (DS1) is the combination of ECG physiological, ABP and PPG features. Their correlation coefficient and p-values criteria have been applied for relevant alarm-wise feature-set selection, and random forest classifier was used for model development and validation. The threshold based approach was used on second dataset (DS2) which is the combination of arrhythmia, ABP and PPG features. The developed ensemble model is able to achieve sensitivity 83.33-100 % (average 95.56 %) being true alarms and suppress false alarms rate 66.67-89% (average 77.25%). The predictability of classifier shows the advantage to deal with unbalanced set of information, therefore overall model performance has reached to 83.96% accuracy. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - Background: Although electrocardiographic monitoring is valuable for continuous surveillance of intensive care unit (ICU) patients, false alarms are common and have been cited as a cause of alarm fatigue. ANSI/ AAMI EC12:2002 states that electrocardiograms (ECGs) should not detect a QRS if the waveform is less than 0.15 mV (1.5 mm) for adult patients, in order to avoid mislabeling P waves or baseline noise as QRSs during complete heart block or asystole. However, ECG software algorithms often use more conservative QRS thresholds, which may result in false-positive asystole alarms in patients with low-amplitude QRS complexes. Objectives: To 1) assess the frequency of low QRS amplitude in a group of ICU patients with one or more false-positive asystole alarms and 2) determine whether low-amplitude QRSs are associated with false-positive asystole alarms during continuous ECG monitoring. Methods: Hospital-acquired standard 12-lead ECGs were examined in a group of 82 ICU patients who had one or more falsepositive asystole alarms. Low QRS amplitude was deined as a unidirectional (only positive or negative) QRS of less than 5 mm in two of four leads (I, II, III, and V1). Results: Low-amplitude QRSs were present in 45 of 82 (55%) patients. The presence of low-amplitude QRSs did not difer according to age, sex, or race. Patients treated in the cardiac ICU had the highest proportion of low-amplitude QRSs. An equivalent proportion of patients had false-positive asystole alarms by group (no low-amplitude QRSs 95% vs. low-amplitude QRSs 87%; P = 0.229). Eight patients (10%) had both true- and false-positive asystole alarms (two [5%] with no low-amplitude QRSs and six [13%] with low-amplitude QRSs; P = 0.229). Conclusion: Low-amplitude QRS, as assessed from hospital 12-lead ECGs, occurs frequently and is more common in cardiac ICU patients. However, this ECG feature did not identify patients with false-positive asystole alarms during continuous ECG monitoring. © Copyright AAMI 2016.

AB  - Background: Heart rate variability indices (HRV) are prognostic marker in cardiovascular diseases. However, the prognostic value and pathophysiological role of HRVs in intensive care patients (ICU-pts) are not fully investigated. We compared HRVs [including non-linear index of long-term fractal β (fractal-β)] with Acute Physiologic and Chronic Health Evaluation III Score (APACHE III) and serum cytokine levels. The former is well-known prognostic index and the latter is indices reflecting various pathophysiological conditions in ICU-pts. Methods: HRVs were obtained from 24-hour ECG monitoring in 80 ICU-pts including 27 post-surgical pts with cardiac complications (67 ± 8 years old) and 53 pts with acute coronary syndrome (65 ± 13 years old). APACHE III was calculated and blood samples were obtained for cytokine measurement by ELIZA method at the time of pts admission to ICU. Cytokines that we measured were IL1β, IIA, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12 (p70), IL-13, IL-15, IL-17, G-CSF, INFγ, TNFα and MIP-1α. HRVs included fractal-β and mean-HR, SDANN, SD-index, pNN50, rMSSD, total frequency spectra fTF), very low frequency spectra (VLF), low frequency spectra (LF), high frequency spectra (HF) and LF/HF ratio. Results: Among HRVs, rMSSD and pNN50 correlated with APACHE III, respectively (r = 0.29 and r = 0.23, p < 0.05). On the other hand, fractal-β correlated with IL-13 and INF-γ (r = 0.26 and r = 0.26, p < 0.05) while mean-HR correlated with IL-8 (r = 0.27, p < 0.05) and SD-index with INF-γ and TNFα (r = 0.33, p < 0.01 and r = 0.28, p < 0.05). In addition, TF correlated with IL-12 (p70) (r = 0.35, p < 0.01) and VLF correlated with IL-12 (p70) and INF-γ (r = 0.26, p < 0.05 and r = 0.39, p < 0.001) while LF with IL-12 and INF-γ (r = 0.25 and r = 0.25, p < 0.05) as well as LF/HF ratio with IL-1β, IL-4, IL-13 and IL-8 (r = 0.23, r = 0.24, r = 0.24 and r = 0.28, p < 0.05). IL-8 correlated with APACHE III (r = 0.30, p < 0.01). Conclusions: Among HRVs and cytokines, rMSSD, pNN50 and IL-8 are associated with the prognosis and many HRVs reflect various immune and inflammatory state in ICU. Measuring HRVs gives us prognostic and pathophysiological information in ICU-pts with cardiac complications.

AB  - Objective: To explore the incidence, causal factors and prognosis of acute cor pulmonale (ACP) complicating H7N9 influenza virus infection. Methods: A retrospective study was conducted. Twenty-one laboratory-confirmed H7N9 patients who required intensive care during March 2013 to September 2015 in the Affiliated First Hospital of Soochow University and Suzhou 5th People's Hospital were enrolled. The ACP was defined as right ventricular (RV) dilatation with a paradoxical septal motion at end-systole. All patients were divided into two groups (ACP group and non-ACP group), and the clinical data of all patients were analyzed retrospectively. The presentation, mechanical ventilation (MV) setting, the characteristics of bedside electrocardiogram (ECG) and echocardiography between the two groups were compared and analyzed. Results: Six of 21 patients with H7N9 influenza virus infection developed ACP during hospitalization with the incidence of 28.6%, and with the presentation of tachycardia, unstabilized hemodynamics and decreased pulse blood oxygen saturation (SpO2). The media time from onset of influenza symptom to ACP occurrence was 11.00(6.25, 20.50) days. On the day of ACP occurrence, the worst value of heart rate was (102.83 ± 20.53) bpm, mean arterial pressure was (81.83 ± 12.14) mmHg (1 mmHg = 0.133 kPa), and oxygenation index was (132.40±74.90) mmHg, and SpO2 was 0.863±0.051, there were no statistically significant differences in above parameters as compared with those of non-ACP group except SpO2. The media from MV to ACP occurrence was 3.50(1.75, 6.75) days. The level of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and airway plateau pressure (Pplat) in ACP group were significantly higher than those of non-ACP group [PEEP (cmH2O, 1 cmH2O = 0.098 kPa):15.17 ± 3.71 vs. 11.73 ±2.57, Pplat (cmH2O):27.50 ± 1.05 vs. 23.09 ±4.37, both P &lt; 0.05]. The incidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and septic shock in ACP group were slightly higher than those of non-ACP group (83.3% vs. 53.3%, 50.0% vs. 26.7%, both P &gt; 0.05). The proportion of right axis deviation in ACP group was significantly higher than that of non-ACP group (83.3% vs. 13.3%, P &lt; 0.01), moderate-to-severe tricuspid regurgitation (TR) and inferior vena cava (IVC) collapse-index less than 50% were more common in ACP patients as compared with those of non-ACP patients (100.0% vs. 60.0%, P &gt; 0.05; 100.0% vs. 20.0%, P &lt; 0.01). The value of tricuspid regurgitation pressure gradient (TRPG) and IVC diameter in ACP group were significantly higher than those of non-ACP group [TRPG (mmHg):45.00 ± 8.65 vs. 28.01 ±9.02, IVC diameter (mm):2.25±0.14 vs. 1.87±0.15, both P &lt; 0.01]. No statistical difference in acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II) and sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) were found between ACP and non-ACP groups (23.33 ±7.06 vs. 19.27 ±5.50, 7.33 ± 1.21 vs. 7.80 ±3.01, both P &gt; 0.05), while the intensive care unit (ICU) mortality in ACP patients was significantly higher than that of non-ACP patients (83.3% vs. 26.7%, P &lt; 0.05). Conclusions: The prevalence of ACP in critically ill patients with H7N9 influenza virus infection was high. MV was an important factor responsible for the development of ACP with severe H7N9 influenza virus infection. Strengthen the monitoring and management of RV dysfunction at early stage was indispensable because of the poor prognosis and non specificity clinical symptoms of ACP in severe H7N9 virus infected patients. © 2016 Heilongjiang Institute of Science and Technology Information.

AB  - Aims: This study aims to compare different doses of magnesium administered via cardioplegic solutions to prevent atrial fibrillation (AF) after coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. Methods: A total of 120 patients who were scheduled for elective CABG surgery using cardiopulmonary bypass were enrolled in this double-blind, randomized clinical trial. After fulfilling the inclusion criteria, they were randomly allocated into three groups (A, B, and C). Patients in groups A, B, and C received 60, 80, and 100 mg/kg of magnesium sulfate via cardioplegic solutions during aortic cross-clamp, respectively. Postoperative AF was assessed by continuous ECG monitoring during 3 days after surgery. Also serum magnesium, potassium, and calcium levels were assessed during the study period. Results: The findings revealed significant differences in four point measurements of serum magnesium level after surgery (P<.001). In particular, it was observed that 10 (26.3%) patients in group A, 4 (10%) patients in group B, and 2 (5.4%) patients in group C had AF after surgery. This indicates patients receiving magnesium at doses of 80 and 100 mg/kg had lower rates of AF occurrence than those receiving 60 mg/kg dose of magnesium (P=.02). Additionally, no significant difference was found in serum calcium and potassium concentration between the three groups throughout the study period. Conclusion: Magnesium administration via the cardioplegic solution during aortic cross-clamping at doses of 80 and 100 mg/kg can reduce the risk of AF occurrence after CABG compared to the dose of 60 mg/kg. Considering the lower rate of AF incidence and shorter length of ICU stay in patients receiving 100 mg/kg of magnesium, it seems reasonable to administer 100 mg/kg magnesium during aortic cross-clamp to prevent postoperative AF. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Purpose: To compare the impact of a 100 kV tube voltage protocol to 120 kV in terms of image quality and radiation dose by a 320 row coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) with automatic exposure control (AEC). Materials and methods: Using a propensity matched analysis we compared a group of 135 patients scanned using a 100 kV tube voltage protocol with a group of 135 subjects scanned employing a 120 kV tube voltage setting. In all subjects the heart rate (HR) was <65 bpm and all CT scans were acquired using a prospective ECG gating and AEC strategy. Mean effective radiation dose and subjective and objective (Noise or N, signal to noise ratio or SNR, contrast to noise ratio or CNR) image quality, were evaluated. Subjective quality was assessed by two experienced radiologists using a 5-point scale (0: non diagnostic—4: excellent) using the 15-segment American Heart Association (AHA) coronary artery classification. Results: Mean effective dose and noise were non significantly different between the two groups: mean effective dose was 2.89 ± 0.7 mSv in the 100 kV group and 2.80 ± 0.57 mSv in the 120 kV group (p = 0.25) while noise was 28.9 ± 3.3 in the 120 kV group and 29.05 ± 3.6 in the 100 kV group (p = 0.72). Both SNR and CNR were significantly higher in the 100 kV group than in the 120 kV group. This data agrees with the evidence that subjective quality was significantly higher in the 100 kV group in the middle and distal segmental classes. Conclusion: Our study shows that, in using a 320 row CCTA with AEC strategy it is better to employ a 100 kV tube voltage protocol because compared to 120 kV tube voltage setting, it appears to significantly improve both subjective and objective image quality without decreasing the mean effective radiation dose. © 2016, Italian Society of Medical Radiology.

AB  - Computerized interpretation of the electrocardiogram (ECG) is increasingly used to assist clinician experts to reduce times to reperfusion for patients suspected of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). In this context, we have developed a system based on Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) for automatic detection of STEMI, using the MicroBlaze soft processor from Xilinx. More particularly, this work aims the implementation of an efficient knowledge-based 4-step algorithm for STEMI diagnosis, using the 12-lead ECG. We have used the Nexys 3 board from Digilent as development tool, and different ECG databases from Physiobank, containing the conventional 12-lead ECG. The implementation performance was tested mainly with 8 records of 12-lead ECG, i.e. 96 ECG signals, providing a sensitivity of 62.5%, with a QRS detection reaching an accuracy of 99.41%. The implementation occupied 97% of the slices of the used FPGA, namely the Spartan 6 XC6SLX16 from Xilinx. To our knowledge, this successful FPGA-based implementation for STEMI detection is novel and authentic. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - False intensive care unit (ICU) alarms induce stress in both patients and clinical staff and decrease the quality of care, thus significantly increasing both the hospital recovery time and rehospitalization rates. In the PhysioNet/CinC Challenge 2015 for reducing false arrhythmia alarms in ICU bedside monitor data, this paper validates the application of a real-time arrhythmia detection library (ADLib, Schiller AG) for the robust detection of five types of life-threatening arrhythmia alarms. The strength of the application is to give immediate feedback on the arrhythmia event within a scan interval of 3 s-7.5 s, and to increase the noise immunity of electrocardiogram (ECG) arrhythmia analysis by fusing its decision with supplementary ECG quality interpretation and real-time pulse wave monitoring (quality and hemodynamics) using arterial blood pressure or photoplethysmographic signals. We achieved the third-ranked real-time score (79.41) in the challenge (Event 1), however, the rank was not officially recognized due to the 'closed-source' entry. This study shows the optimization of the alarm decision module, using tunable parameters such as the scan interval, lead quality threshold, and pulse wave features, with a follow-up improvement of the real-time score (80.07). The performance (true positive rate, true negative rate) is reported in the blinded challenge test set for different arrhythmias: asystole (83%, 96%), extreme bradycardia (100%, 90%), extreme tachycardia (98%, 80%), ventricular tachycardia (84%, 82%), and ventricular fibrillation (78%, 84%). Another part of this study considers the validation of ADLib with four reference ECG databases (AHA, EDB, SVDB, MIT-BIH) according to the international recommendations for performance reports in ECG monitors (ANSI/AAMI EC57). The sensitivity (Se) and positive predictivity (+P) are: QRS detector QRS (Se, +P) > 99.7%, ventricular ectopic beat (VEB) classifier VEB (Se, +P) = 95%, and ventricular fibrillation detector VFIB (P + = 94.8%) > VFIB (Se = 86.4%), adjusted to the clinical setting requirements, giving preference to low false positive alarms. © 2016 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.

AB  - There has been a high rate of false alarms for the critical electrocardiogram (ECG) arrhythmia events in intensive care units (ICUs), from which the 'crying-wolf' syndrome may be resulted and patient safety may be jeopardized. This article presents an algorithm to reduce false critical arrhythmia alarms using arterial blood pressure (ABP) and/or photoplethysmogram (PPG) waveform features. We established long duration reference alarm datasets which consist of 573 ICU waveform-alarm records (283 for development set and 290 for test set) with total length of 551 patent days. Each record has continuous recordings of ECGs, ABP and/or PPG signals and contains one or multiple critical ECG alarms. The average length of a record is 23 h. There are totally 2408 critical ECG alarms (1414 in the development set and 994 in the test set), each of which was manually annotated by experts. The algorithm extracts ABP/PPG pulse features on a beat-by-beat basis. For each pulse, five event feature indicators (EFIs), which correspond to the five critical ECG alarms, are generated. At the time of a critical ECG alarm, the corresponding EFI values of those ABP/PPG pulses around the alarm time are checked for adjudicating (accept/reject) this alarm. The algorithm retains all (100%) the true alarms and significantly reduces the false alarms. Our results suggest that the algorithm is effective and practical on account of its real-time dynamic processing mechanism and computational efficiency. © 2016 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.

AB  - This study developed algorithms to decrease the arrhythmia false alarms in the ICU by processing multimodal signals of photoplethysmography (PPG), arterial blood pressure (ABP), and two ECG signals. The goal was to detect the five critical arrhythmias comprising asystole (ASY), extreme bradycardia (EBR), extreme tachycardia (ETC), ventricular tachycardia (VTA), and ventricular flutter or fibrillation (VFB). The different characteristics of the arrhythmias suggested the application of individual signal processing for each alarm and the combination of the algorithms to enhance false alarm detection. Thus, different features and signal processing techniques were used for each arrhythmia type. The ECG signals were first processed to reduce the signal interference. Then, a Hilbert-transform based QRS detector algorithm was utilized to identify the QRS complexes, which were then processed to determine the instantaneous heart rate. The pulsatile signals (PPG and ABP) were processed to discover the pulse onset of beats which were then employed to measure the heart rate. The signal quality index (SQI) of the signals was implemented to verify the integrity of the heart rate information. The overall score obtained by our algorithms in the 2015 Computing in Cardiology Challenge was a score of 74.03% for retrospective and 69.92% for real-time analysis. © 2016 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to develop algorithms to lower the incidence of false arrhythmia alarms in the ICU using information from independent sources, namely electrocardiogram (ECG), arterial blood pressure (ABP) and photoplethysmogram (PPG). Our approach relies on robust adaptive signal processing techniques in order to extract accurate heart rate (HR) values from the different waveforms. Based on the quality of available signals, heart rate was either estimated from pulsatile waveforms using an adaptive frequency tracking algorithm or computed from ECGs using an adaptive mathematical morphology approach. Furthermore, we developed a supplementary measure based on the spectral purity of the ECGs to determine whether a ventricular tachycardia or flutter/fibrillation arrhythmia has taken place. Finally, alarm veracity was determined based on a set of decision rules on HR and spectral purity values. The proposed method was evaluated on the PhysioNet/CinC Challenge 2015 database, which is composed of 1250 life-threatening alarm recordings, each categorized into either bradycardia, tachycardia, asystole, ventricular tachycardia or ventricular flutter/fibrillation arrhythmia. This resulted in overall true positive rates of 95%/99% and overall true negative rates of 76%/80% on the real-time and retrospective subsets of the test dataset, respectively. © 2016 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.

AB  - False arrhythmia alarms pose a major threat to the quality of care in today's ICU. Thus, the PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2015 aimed at reducing false alarms by exploiting multimodal cardiac signals recorded by a patient monitor. False alarms for asystole, extreme bradycardia, extreme tachycardia, ventricular flutter/fibrillation as well as ventricular tachycardia were to be reduced using two electrocardiogram channels, up to two cardiac signals of mechanical origin as well as a respiratory signal. In this paper, an approach combining multimodal rhythmicity estimation and machine learning is presented. Using standard short-time autocorrelation and robust beat-to-beat interval estimation, the signal's self-similarity is analyzed. In particular, beat intervals as well as quality measures are derived which are further quantified using basic mathematical operations (min, mean, max, etc). Moreover, methods from the realm of image processing, 2D Fourier transformation combined with principal component analysis, are employed for dimensionality reduction. Several machine learning approaches are evaluated including linear discriminant analysis and random forest. Using an alarm-independent reduction strategy, an overall false alarm reduction with a score of 65.52 in terms of the real-time scoring system of the challenge is achieved on a hidden dataset. Employing an alarm-specific strategy, an overall real-time score of 78.20 at a true positive rate of 95% and a true negative rate of 78% is achieved. While the results for some categories still need improvement, false alarms for extreme tachycardia are suppressed with 100% sensitivity and specificity. © 2016 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.

AB  - False alarms in intensive care units represent a serious threat to patients. We propose a method for detection of five live-threatening arrhythmias. It is designed to work with multimodal data containing electrocardiograph and arterial blood pressure or photoplethysmograph signals. The presented method is based on descriptive statistics and Fourier and Hilbert transforms. It was trained using 750 records. The method was validated during the follow-up phase of the CinC/Physionet Challenge 2015 on a hidden dataset with 500 records, achieving a sensitivity of 93% (95%) and a specificity of 87% (88%) for real-time (retrospective) files. The given sensitivity and specificity resulted in score of 81.62 (84.96) for real-time (retrospective) records. The presented method is an improved version of the original algorithm awarded the first and the second prize in CinC/Physionet Challenge 2015. © 2016 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.

AB  - Our approach to detecting false arrhythmia alarms in the intensive care unit breaks down into several tasks. It involves beat detection on different signals: electrocardiogram, photoplethysmogram and arterial blood pressure. The quality of each channel has to be estimated in order to evaluate the reliability of obtained beat detections. The information about the heart rate from the different channels must be integrated in order to find a final conclusion. Some alarm types require particular detectors as is the case of ventricular fibrillation. To identify false ventricular tachycardia alarms we needed to classify heart beats as normal/ventricular. For that purpose we introduce a new feature, QRS polarity type. This feature was important in order to reduce misclassification of ventricular beats: there was an improvement in the ventricular tachycardia alarm true positive rate from 69% to 81%. However, the true negative rate was reduced from 95% to 69% and our global challenge score (real-time event) dropped from 79.02 to 74.28. Our challenge algorithm achieved the third best score in the 2015 PhysioNet/CinC challenge event 1 (real time). © 2016 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.

AB  - False alarm (FA) rates as high as 86% have been reported in intensive care unit monitors. High FA rates decrease quality of care by slowing staff response times while increasing patient burdens and stresses. In this study, we proposed a rule-based and multi-channel information fusion method for accurately classifying the true or false alarms for five life-threatening arrhythmias: asystole (ASY), extreme bradycardia (EBR), extreme tachycardia (ETC), ventricular tachycardia (VTA) and ventricular flutter/fibrillation (VFB). The proposed method consisted of five steps: (1) signal pre-processing, (2) feature detection and validation, (3) true/false alarm determination for each channel, (4) 'real-time' true/false alarm determination and (5) 'retrospective' true/false alarm determination (if needed). Up to four signal channels, that is, two electrocardiogram signals, one arterial blood pressure and/or one photoplethysmogram signal were included in the analysis. Two events were set for the method validation: event 1 for 'real-time' and event 2 for 'retrospective' alarm classification. The results showed that 100% true positive ratio (i.e. sensitivity) on the training set were obtained for ASY, EBR, ETC and VFB types, and 94% for VTA type, accompanied by the corresponding true negative ratio (i.e. specificity) results of 93%, 81%, 78%, 85% and 50% respectively, resulting in the score values of 96.50, 90.70, 88.89, 92.31 and 64.90, as well as with a final score of 80.57 for event 1 and 79.12 for event 2. For the test set, the proposed method obtained the score of 88.73 for ASY, 77.78 for EBR, 89.92 for ETC, 67.74 for VFB and 61.04 for VTA types, with the final score of 71.68 for event 1 and 75.91 for event 2. © 2016 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.

AB  - The paper presents the design and implementation of an IOT-based health monitoring system for emergency medical services which can demonstrate collection, integration, and interoperation of IoT data flexibly which can provide support to emergency medical services like Intensive Care Units (ICU), using a INTEL GALILEO 2ND generation development board. The proposed model enables users to improve health related risks and reduce healthcare costs by collecting, recording, analyzing and sharing large data streams in real time and efficiently. The idea of this project came so to reduce the headache of patient to visit to doctor every time he need to check his blood pressure, heart beat rate, temperature etc. With the help of this proposal the time of both patients and doctors are saved and doctors can also help in emergency scenario as much as possible. The proposed outcome of the project is to give proper and efficient medical services to patients by connecting and collecting data information through health status monitors which would include patient's heart rate, blood pressure and ECG and sends an emergency alert to patient's doctor with his current status and full medical information. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - Background and Objectives: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia and a growing healthcare burden worldwide. It is often asymptomatic and may appear as episodes of very short duration; hence, the development of methods for its automatic detection is a challenging requirement to achieve early diagnosis and treatment strategies. The present work introduces a novel method exploiting the relative wavelet energy (RWE) to automatically detect AF episodes of a wide variety in length. Methods: The proposed method analyzes the atrial activity of the surface electrocardiogram (ECG), i.e., the TQ interval, thus being independent on the ventricular activity. To improve its performance under noisy recordings, signal averaging techniques were applied. The method's performance has been tested with synthesized recordings under different AF variable conditions, such as the heart rate, its variability, the atrial activity amplitude or the presence of noise. Next, the method was tested with real ECG recordings. Results: Results proved that the RWE provided a robust automatic detection of AF under wide ranges of heart rates, atrial activity amplitudes as well as noisy recordings. Moreover, the method's detection delay proved to be shorter than most of previous works. A trade-off between detection delay and noise robustness was reached by averaging 15 TQ intervals. Under these conditions, AF was detected in less than 7 beats, with an accuracy higher than 90%, which is comparable to previous works. Conclusions: Unlike most of previous works, which were mainly based on quantifying the irregular ventricular response during AF, the proposed metric presents two major advantages. First, it can perform successfully even under heart rates with no variability. Second, it consists of a single metric, thus turning its clinical interpretation and real-time implementation easier than previous methods requiring combined indices under complex classifiers. © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB  - Following a surgical procedure, patients are monitored in an ICU until physically stable, after which are discharged to a ward for further evaluation and recovery. Usually, ward evaluation does not imply continuous physiological parameters monitoring and therefore patient relapse is not uncommon. The present paper describes the steps taken to design and build a low-cost modular monitoring system prototype. This system aims to offer mobile support in order to facilitate faster and better medical interventions in emergency cases and has been developed using low-power dedicated sensor arrays for EKG, SpO2, temperature and movement. The interfaces for these sensors have been developed according to the IoT model: a central control unit exposes a RESTful based Web interface that ensures a platform agnostic behaviour and provides a flexible mechanism to integrate new components. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - This study was to investigate and define what is considered as a current clinical practice in hemodynamic monitoring and vasoactive medication use after cardiac surgery in Italy. A 33-item questionnaire was sent to all intensive care units (ICUs) admitting patients after cardiac surgery. 71 out of 92 identified centers (77.2 %) returned a completed questionnaire. Electrocardiogram, invasive blood pressure, central venous pressure, pulse oximetry, diuresis, body temperature and blood gas analysis were identified as routinely used hemodynamic monitoring, whereas advanced monitoring was performed with pulmonary artery catheter or echocardiography. Crystalloids were the fluids of choice for volume replacement (86.8 % of Centers). To guide volume management, central venous pressure (26.7 %) and invasive blood pressure (19.7 %) were the most frequently used parameters. Dobutamine was the first choice for treatment of left heart dysfunction (40 %) and epinephrine was the first choice for right heart dysfunction (26.8 %). Half of the Centers had an internal protocol for vasoactive drugs administration. Intra-aortic balloon pump and extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation were widely available among Cardiothoracic ICUs. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors were suspended in 28 % of the Centers. The survey shows what is considered as standard monitoring in Italian Cardiac ICUs. Standard, routinely used monitoring consists of ECG, SpO2, etCO2, invasive BP, CVP, diuresis, body temperature, and BGA. It also shows that there is large variability among the various Centers regarding hemodynamic monitoring of fluid therapy and inotropes administration. Further research is required to better standardize and define the indicators to improve the standards of intensive care after cardiac surgery among Italian cardiac ICUs. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - We have studied the effects of the 0.05 Hz first-order high-pass filter (AC coupling) on the automatic measurements of the electrocardiogram (ECG). The standard 12-lead ECG of 1248 patients and the automated measurements of the AC-and DC-coupled (unfiltered) versions were compared. We found a strong, linear correlation between the QRS integral and the difference in ST-segment amplitudes, suggesting that the AC coupling alters the ST segment. The effect on the remaining part of the ECG was minimal. Medical professionals and developers of software for ECG interpretation should be aware of such high-pass filter effects, since they could be misinterpreted as pathophysiology or some pathophysiology could be masked by these effects. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - Aim: Resuscitation guidelines recommend different treatments depending on the patient's cardiac rhythm. Rhythm interpretation is a key tool to retrospectively evaluate and improve the quality of treatment. Manual rhythm annotation is time consuming and an obstacle for handling large resuscitation datasets efficiently. The objective of this study was to develop a system for automatic rhythm interpretation by using signal processing and machine learning algorithms. Methods: Data from 302 out of hospital cardiac arrest patients were used. In total 1669 3-second artifact free ECG segments with clinical rhythm annotations were extracted. The proposed algorithms combine 32 features obtained from both wavelet- and time-domain representations of the ECG, followed by a feature selection procedure based on the wrapper method in a nested cross-validation architecture. Linear and quadratic discriminant analyses (LDA and QDA) were used to automatically classify the segments into one of five rhythm types: ventricular tachycardia (VT), ventricular fibrillation (VF), pulseless electrical activity (PEA), asystole (AS), and pulse generating rhythms (PR). Results: The overall accuracy for the best algorithm was 68%. VT, VF, and AS are recognized with sensitivities of 71%, 75%, and 79%, respectively. Sensitivities for PEA and PR were 55% and 56%, respectively, which reflects the difficulty of identifying pulse using only the ECG. Conclusions: An ECG based automatic rhythm interpreter for resuscitation has been demonstrated. The interpreter handles VT, VF and AS well, while PEA and PR discrimination poses a more difficult problem. © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB  - The 12-lead Electrocardiogram (ECG) is ubiquitously used as a diagnostic support tool to detect cardiovascular disease. However, it is difficult to read and is often incorrectly interpreted. This study aims to further previous research, which used of a set of interactive questions and prompts to guide an interpreter through the ECG reporting process. The model was named 'Interactive Progressive based ECG Interpretation' (IPI). In this study, the IPI model has been augmented with an automatic diagnoses suggestion tool following annotated analysis of an ECG. To accomplish this, a rule-based algorithm has been created to assess the interpreters' ECG annotations to each of the interactive questions in the IPI model. This Differential Diagnoses Algorithm (DDA) was implemented using web technologies such as JavaScript and uses a modern device agnostic and language independent storage format (JSON) for defining the rules. Hence, by augmenting the IPI model with the DDA we hypothesize that this will further lower the number of interpretation errors and increase diagnostic accuracy in ECG interpretation. © 2016 CCAL.

AB  - Decision support tools assist clinicians every day in healthcare by supporting decision making at the point of care. For example, decision support tools can help clinicians reduce misdiagnoses during the interpretation of the Electrocardiogram (ECG), by providing a reference to ECG background, causes, features, waves and segment data. As a potential solution to these problems an ECG interpretation clinical decision support tool (CDSS) was constructed. The prototype consisted of a web based user interface connected to a SQL database of thirty-eight identified ECG diagnostic interpretations. Benefits and risks of using a clinician friendly web based query-builder interface to perform SQL queries on the database against traditional ECG interpretation methods were identified. Ethical reasons for using the web based decision support system software to assist ECG interpretation are discussed. Potential benefits in using the ECG interpretation CDSS across computer /tablet/smart-phone devices to assist the clinician's diagnosis decision making process are identified. © 2016 CCAL.

AB  - In heart rate monitoring, the Electrocardiogram (ECG) is commonly used and is considered to be the gold standard in the field. However, long term monitoring with ECG is rarely used except for ICU and 24-hours Holter. Prolonged cardiac monitoring in various setups can be achieved using a Ballistocardiogram (BCG), which serves as a convenient way for contact free monitoring of the heart activity. This study was aimed to assess the potential of measuring cardiac Inter Beat Interval (IBI) series in real-time using a BCG signal using a contact-free piezo-electric sensor placed under the mattress (EarlySense Ltd.). In this paper, we evaluated three real-time novel algorithm that provide IBI measurement, predicated IBI measurement accuracy and IBI statistic. The performance of these algorithms was evaluated using IBI series derived from one-lead ECG signal. The results support the claim that under the mattress piezoelectric sensor can be used to accurately measure IBI in real-time, and establish the basis for Heart Rate Variability (HRV) analysis. © 2016 CCAL.

AB  - In this paper, a new method of automatic detection of the Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome is proposed based on electrocardiograms (ECGs) signals. Firstly, with the continuous wavelet transform (CWT), the P wave, the T wave and the QRS complex are identified. Then, their durations are also computed after determination of the boundaries (onsets and offsets of the P, T waves and the QRS complex). Secondly, the PR interval, the QRS complex interval and the area of the QRS complex are determined in order to detect the presence or not of the delta wave. This method has been tested on ECGs signals from patients affected by the WPW syndrome in order to evaluate its robustness. It can provide assistance to cardiologists during the interpretation of the ECG. © 2016 CCAL.

AB  - The ECG testing is very common in health diagnose of a patient. Also, in present it is common to apply as many automated technology solutions as possible. Generally, this should insure better quality of gained diagnostic results. On the other hand, complex solutions invoke human error in procedure, which ultimately can provide inaccurate results. The influence of such errors on example of ECG testing is analyzed and compared to normal ECG test in this research, where six scenarios are deliberately forced to provide fault diagnose. © 2016, Wydawnictwo SIGMA - N O T Sp. z o.o.

AB  - Continuous patient monitoring systems acquire enormous amounts of data that is either manually analysed by doctors or automatically processed using intelligent algorithms. Sections of data acquired over long period of time can be corrupted with artefacts due to patient movement, sensor placement and interference from other sources. Owing to the large volume of data these artefacts need to be automatically identified so that the analysis systems and doctors are aware of them while making medical diagnosis. Three important factors are explored that must be considered and quantified for the design and evaluation of automatic artefact identification algorithms: signal quality, interpretation quality and computational complexity. The first two are useful to determine the effectiveness of an algorithm, whereas the third is particularly vital in mHealth systems where computational resources are heavily constrained. A series of artefact identification and filtering algorithms are then presented focusing on the electrocardiography data. These algorithms are quantified using the three metrics to demonstrate how different algorithms can be evaluated and compared to select the best ones for a given wireless sensor network. © 2016 The Institution of Engineering and Technology.

AB  - Objectives To evaluate the feasibility of non-electrocardiogram (ECG)-triggered 70-kVp high-pitch aortic computed tomography angiography (CTA) with iterative reconstruction (IR) and reduced contrast agent using second-generation dual-source CT (DSCT). Methods Seventy-seven patients were examined: group A (n = 21), 70-kVp high-pitch (3.2) CTA, 60 mL contrast agent and IR on second-generation DSCT; group B (n = 29), standard-pitch (1.2) CTA, automatic tube voltage selection, filtered back projection and 80 mL contrast agent on second-generation DSCT; group C (n = 27), 120-kVp standard-pitch (1.2) CTA, filtered back projection, and 80 mL contrast agent on first-generation DSCT. Computed tomography values, noise, signal-to-noise ratio, contrast-to-noise ratio, and subjective image quality were compared. Results Computed tomography values and noise of all aortic segments in group A were increased compared with groups B and C (P < 0.05). Group B showed the highest signal-to-noise ratio and contrast-to-noise ratio for all aortic segments (P < 0.05), whereas no significant differences were found between groups A and C (P > 0.05). Mean effective dose was 0.88 ± 0.08 mSv for group A, reduced by 93% compared to group C and by 90% compared to group B. Conclusions Non-ECG-triggered 70-kVp high-pitch aortic CTA with IR provides equivalent diagnostic image quality with 90% reduction of radiation dose and 25% reduction of contrast volume compared with standard 120-kVp CTA. © 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

AB  - Radiology and pathology almost by definition are "big data" in both the healthcare and research arenas. The data sources are not only big, but incredibly varied. At the core of both medical practices are the acquired images that must be processed, transmitted, stored/archived and interpreted. Radiology is the most common medical imaging specialty with recent estimates of 3.6 billion medical procedures being done worldwide annually with ionizing radiation (3.1 billion diagnostic radiologic, 0.5 billion dental, and 37 million nuclear medicine examinations) [1]. The workload in pathology in terms of number of images that need to be processed and interpreted are incredibly large as well [2]. One of the key differences between radiology and pathology is that radiology has been digital for over 25 years and used routinely in clinical practice since the early 1990s; while pathology, although having had digital capability as whole slide imaging (WSI) since the late 1990s has yet to take off clinically due in most part to lack of FDA approval for the WSI acquisition and viewing systems for clinical use. With the advent of telemedicine the number of types of "big data" have increased exponentially with everything from store-forward dermatology and ophthalmology images, to realtime video data, to monitoring data of all sorts from wearable and other types of physiological monitoring sensors operated in every mode from periodic to 24/7. On the clinical side there are a number of tools that have been developed over the years to deal with all this data, most recently in the form of "dashboards" to help visualize aspects of clinical productivity such as device (e.g., MRI, CT, ultrasound) utilization to optimize patient scheduling and identify bottlenecks, clinician tracking to monitor RVUs (relative value units), QA/QC monitoring and a host of other metrics required to run a large or even small healthcare enterprise. Most of these tools include access not only to the raw data, but also to graphic and other visual representations to help users interpret the data efficiently and effectively. Surprisingly there have been very few studies on this aspect, although companies are starting to realize that there is usually no one-size-fits-all GUI and that product offerings likely need to be tailored somewhat at the individual site level. In terms of remote monitoring data there are a number of aspects relevant to the big data question, most typically centered on what data are useful and what data are not, and how to interpret the data (either by human or computer) in a meaningful way. For example, remote ECG monitoring systems are increasingly being used to monitor patients with a variety of cardiac conditions but there are significant challenges [3]. One of the key problems is trying to automate the analysis of the incoming data to reliability identify abnormal events (and intervene) without false positive rates that render the system useless due to the "annoyance" factor. Numerous groups are working on developing tools to classify the signals, but the problem is confounded by the fact that clinical guidelines are typically based on (often outdated and often applicable to only a narrow group of patients) population based data that at the individual level may be meaningless (e.g., baseline "normal" function for one patient may be quite different from baseline for someone else, so the algorithm needs to take this into account in order to maximize the true positive and minimize the false positive rates). The American Telemedicine Association (ATA) is developing a guideline document to address another important big data question in remote monitoring - the relationship between health care professionals and patient data, the responsibilities of the health care professional or clinical team to assess, interpret, and respond, to the data, and the responsibilities of the patient with respect to the data. For example, the nature and intent of use of the data are important to consider. If the data have a measurable impact on quality improvements in care delivery, it should receive a higher level of importance. If the data represent information about leading indicators for quality, then importance is high, but if they represent information for trailing indicators the data are less important. Data sources can also be weighted by importance. Healthcare provider requested data generated by the patient in a formal program based on improving health indicators, particularly for high risk patients, have high importance, while information generated by a patient and sent to a clinician that is not a part of a formal care process is of less importance. The technology itself can be taken into account as consumer-grade mobile technologies can be weighted less than an FDA cleared medical devices. From the research perspective there are numerous ways that big data are being used not only in terms of developing better ways to visualize and interpret image data (for example the use computer-aided detection and decision tools to analyze radiographic, pathologic and other clinical images), but also to analyze non-image medical data such as radiographic and pathologic reports. With respect to the latter, for example, there has been recent work in our department using sentiment analysis to assess whether the sentiment of a provider is associated with radiographic imaging utilization in the context of medical notes on ICU patients. Ten years of EMR data were analyzed using sentiment analysis software (a branch of natural language processing (NLP) that combines text analysis and computational linguistics to assess emotion in written text). Initial data suggest that there is a significant association with negative sentiment being associated with an increase in image utilization that decreased over time. In other words, physicians who judged their patients to be failing ordered more imaging exams than for those they perceived of as healthier or more stable, but then as time passed ordering was reduced overall. Another project is conducting a retrospective review of records from over 100,000 breast imaging studies to study rates of recall based on time intervals from last interpreted examination, permitting an analysis of the impact of human capital depreciation, fatigue, and more generally the day of week on the likelihood of a recall recommendation. This type of analysis could guide how we schedule our clinicians (easing them back into their routine so to speak) after vacations, multiple days on service and so on in order to avoid errors. Although much of the research focus in big data is focused on the computational side of the equation, there is some work being conducted on the human side - how does the clinician or other healthcare provider deal with all this information? On the one hand are studies that assess whether or not data from these sources (e.g., remote monitoring) has any impact on patient care [4]. On the other hand are the studies that approach data interpretation and use from a more human factors perspective. For example, we use eye tracking technology (Figure 1) to investigate and understand how clinicians interact with images and whether the information provided impacts both the decisions rendered as well as the efficiency with which they are rendered. (Figure Presented) In one recent study we examined the impact of adding a photo of the patient to the interface when radiologists interpreted a series of chest images. The goal was to address the fact that due to mislabeling of images "wrong patient" errors can and do occur. With 10 observers viewing a series of 21 portable chest x-ray images with and without photos, the presence of the photograph reduced the number of fixations (chest radiograph only mean 98.68; chest with photograph present 80.81; photograph 10.59) and total dwell (chest radiograph only mean 30.84 sec; chest radiograph with photograph present 25.68; photograph 3.93) on the chest radiograph as a result of periodically looking at the photograph. Overall time viewing the cases did not differ as time not spent on the radiograph was spent on the photograph. On average readers scanned from the radiograph to the photographs about 4 times during search. The added information of photographs may help with certain image interpretation tasks and may help personalize the reading experience for radiologists. There are numerous ways that big data is used in clinical practice. This presentation will highlight some of the novel approaches being used to analyze clinical data a variety of sources to address pressing questions in the clinic regarding ways to optimize data presentation for the clinical user as well as how to use big data to guide clinical practice and optimize patient care. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - Background: Measurement of myocardial T2 is becoming widely used in the assessment of patients at risk for cardiac iron overload. The conventional breath-hold, ECG-triggered, segmented, multi-echo gradient echo (MGRE) sequence used for myocardial T2quantification is very sensitive to respiratory motion and may not be feasible in patients who are unable to breath-hold. We propose a free-breathing myocardial T2 mapping approach that combines a single-shot gradient-echo echo-planar imaging (GRE-EPI) sequence for T2-weighted image acquisition with automatic non-rigid motion correction (MOCO) of respiratory motion between single-shot images. Methods: ECG-triggered T2-weighted images at different echo times were acquired by a black-blood, single-shot GRE-EPI sequence during free-breathing. A single image at a single TE is acquired in each heartbeat. Automatic non-rigid MOCO was applied to correct for in-plane respiratory motion before pixel-wise T2mapping. In a total of 117 patients referred for clinical cardiac magnetic resonance exams, the free-breathing MOCO GRE-EPI sequence was compared to the breath-hold segmented MGRE approach. Image quality was scored independently by 2 experienced observers blinded to the particular image acquisition strategy. T2measurements in the interventricular septum and in the liver were compared for the two methods in all cases with adequate image quality. Results: T2maps were acquired in all 117 patients using the breath-hold MGRE and the free-breathing MOCO GRE-EPI approaches, including 8 patients with myocardial iron overload and 25 patients with hepatic iron overload. The mean image quality of the free-breathing MOCO GRE-EPI images was scored significantly higher than that of the breath-hold MGRE images by both reviewers. Out of the 117 studies, 21 breath-hold MGRE studies (17.9 % of all the patients) were scored to be less than adequate or very poor by both reviewers, while only 2 free-breathing MOCO GRE-EPI studies were scored to be less than adequate image quality. In a comparative evaluation of the images with at least adequate quality, the intra-class correlation coefficients for myocardial and liver T2were 0.868 and 0.986 respectively (p < 0.001), indicating that the T2measured by breath-hold MGRE and free-breathing MOCO GRE-EPI were in close agreement. The coefficient of variation between the breath-hold and free-breathing approaches for myocardial and liver T2were 9.88 % and 9.38 % respectively. Bland-Altman plots demonstrated good absolute agreement of T2in the interventricular septum and the liver from the free-breathing and breath-hold approaches (mean differences -0.03 and 0.16 ms, respectively). Conclusion: The free-breathing approach described for T2mapping using MOCO GRE-EPI enables accurate myocardial and liver T2measurements and is insensitive to respiratory motion. © 2015 Jin et al.

AB  - To compare the performance of semi-automatic versus manual segmentation for ECG-triggered cardiovascular computed tomography (CT) examinations prior to transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), with focus on the speed and precision of experienced versus inexperienced observers. The preoperative ECG-triggered CT data of 30 consecutive patients who were scheduled for TAVR were included. All datasets were separately evaluated by two radiologists with 1 and 5 years of experience (novice and expert, respectively) in cardiovascular CT using an evaluation software program with or without a semi-automatic TAVR workflow. The time expended for data loading and all segmentation steps required for the implantation planning were assessed. Inter-software as well as inter-observer reliability analysis was performed. The CT datasets were successfully evaluated, with mean duration between 520.4 ± 117.6 s and 693.2 ± 159.5 s. The three most time-consuming steps were the 3D volume rendering, the measurement of aorta diameter and the sizing of the aortic annulus. Using semi-automatic segmentation, a novice could evaluate CT data approximately 12.3 % faster than with manual segmentation, and an expert could evaluate CT data approximately 10.3 % faster [mean differences of 85.4 ± 83.8 s (p < 0.001) and 59.8 ± 101 s (p < 0.001), respectively]. The inter-software reliability for a novice was slightly lower than for an expert; however, the reliability for a novice and expert was excellent (ICC 0.92, 95 % CI 0.75–0.97/ICC 0.96, 95 % CI 0.91–0.98). Automatic aortic annulus detection failed in two patients (6.7 %). The study revealed excellent inter-software and inter-observer reliability, with a mean ICC of 0.95. TAVR evaluation can be accomplished significantly faster with semi-automatic rather than with manual segmentation, with comparable exactness, showing a benefit for experienced and inexperienced observers. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Purpose: We investigated incidence, risk factors for new-onset atrial fibrillation (NAF), and prognostic impact during septic shock in medical Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients. Methods: Prospective, observational study in a university hospital. Consecutive patients from 03/ 2011 to 05/2013 with septic shock were eligible. Exclusion criteria were age <18 years, history of AF, transfer with prior septic shock. Included patients were equipped with long-duration (7 days) Holter ECG monitoring. NAF was defined as an AF episode lasting >30 seconds. Patient characteristics, infection criteria, cardiovascular parameters, severity of illness, support therapies were recorded. Results: Among 66 patients, 29(44%) developed NAF; 10 (34%) would not have been diagnosed without Holter ECG monitoring. NAF patients were older, with more markers of heart failure (troponin and NT-pro-BNP), lower left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), longer QRS duration and more nonsustained supra ventricular arrhythmias (<30s) on day 1 than patients who maintained sinus rhythm. By multivariate analysis, age (OR: 1.06; p = 0.01) and LVEF<45% (OR: 13.01, p = 0.03) were associated with NAF. NAF did not predict 28 or 90 day mortality. Conclusions: NAF is common, especially in older patients, and is associated with low ejection fraction. We did not find NAF to be independently associated with higher mortality. © 2015 Guenancia et al.

AB  - ECG signal is time varying in nature which is most common source used for the diagnosis and analysis of heart diseases present in the patient. ECG is recorded by placing electrodes at specified positions of human body. During recording, ECG is contaminated with artifacts and noises which always degrade its quality, and makes accurate and automatic interpretation more difficult. Power line interference, baseline wanders and muscle tremors are mostly noticed artifacts or noises. So for accurate delineation of characteristics points of ECG, a good quality of ECG is necessary. This paper is presenting a survey on various methods developed for de-noising, delineation of characteristics points and classification of diseases along with their respective advantages and disadvantages. © 2015 IEEE.

AB  - With the increasing quality and costs of health services a lot of attention is put to provide excellent care on the ICU. However, the amount of false alarms of cardiac episodes still outnumbers the true ones significantly. The advanced analysis of multiple signals registered by monitoring system might enable reduction of the false alarms. We analyzed 750 multi-channel recordings from the PhysioNet Challenge 2015 labeled either 'true alarm' or 'false alarm'. In our algorithm there are multiple methods enabling to determine the location of R peaks in ECG signal, basing mostly on RS slopes. Similar slope detection method is performed for other channels provided. In case of signals where it is not possible to detect QRS complexes direct signal morphology assessment is used. These steps allowed us to obtain information needed to verifY if the alarm was true or false. The final scores of PhysioNet Challenge 2015 were: 57. 72for Real-time event and 63.69 for the Retrospective one. © 2015 CCAL.

AB  - High sampling frequency is not usually available in hospital monitoring systems, what can limit the usefulness of the data, namely for repolarization measures. In this work the reliability of beat-to-beat measures using low sampling frequency is quantified with respect to the original high sampling rate. ECG recordings originally at 1000 Hz, including intensive care patients data, were downsampled to 500 Hz and to 250 Hz. Automatic delineation was applied to extract beat-to-beat intervals. The reliability was measured considering concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC); the Information-based measure of disagreement (IBMD) was used for agreement quantification. High reliability and low disagreement were generally found. Using the conventional interpretation excellent consistency was found at 250 HZ for more than 68%, 50%, 50% and 58% of the cases for RR, RT, QT and QTc, respectively. Results indicate that at 250 Hz RR, RT, QT and QTc measures are still reliable compared with the values at 1000 Hz. © 2015 CCAL.

AB  - It is crucial to assure the quality of ECG recordings to support correct clinical interpretation. This research aimed at developing an automated standardization method to gauge digital electrocardiography (EC) devices. The proposed microprocessed gauge equipment (MGE) is divided into digital and analogic circuits, and embedded software to control them. Conditioned reference signals (CRS) from Physionet Bank were embedded in the MGE to simulate cardiac activity. The outputs from the MGE (or EC) are then compared with the CRS. All circuits of the MGE are gauged at the self-check mode. CRS are sent to the EC when set at the EC check mode. A commercial EC equipment was used in the MGE validation (IEC60601-2-51:2005), assessed with the statistical R2 correlation analysis and Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS). At the MGE self-test, temperature and humidity were changed (R2≥0.99 as designed). The KS test (P<0.01) resulted in D=0.012 for amplitude accuracy, 0.0028 for timing accuracy and 0.021 for signal stability against noise influence. All KS values were lower than their respective critical values according to the default standard (5%). Finally, visual inspection between EC signals and CRS on printed graph paper at a standard scale certifies the EC reliability. © 2015 CCAL.

AB  - Sudden death is the most common disease of heart diseases and usually caused by cardiac arrest. The electrocardiograph (ECG) system is the most direct way to observe and monitor health status of the heart. In this kind of disease, the patient may need continuous monitoring, and sometimes is kept in Intensive Care Unit (ICU), which needs more utilities and manpower that will eventually leads to increase the cost and demands for qualified medical staff. In this paper we introduce a comprehensive real time monitoring ECG system for continuous monitoring patients inside/outside home. Wearable Wireless Sensor Network with a cluster head is connected to patient body for monitoring. Measured data by WWSS are transmitted via cluster head to an internet connection to the monitoring system located on the hospital. In case of emergency, the measured data is sent to the physician's cell phone for any necessary actions. We discuss the inside/outside system structure. Additionally, we analyze the proposed system in terms of power consumptions and optimum distance between WSN sensors. © 2015 The Authors.

AB  - The necessity of respiratory monitoring is rapidly increasing in medical field to diagnose various cardio-pulmonary diseases. It is difficult to monitor respiration for ambulatory and ICU patients, as conventional methods are either obtrusive or suffer from low accuracy. The extraction of ECG derived respiration (EDR) signal using single-lead ECG has been proposed lately. This allows monitoring of ECG and respiration signal simultaneously from a recorded ECG signal. Recently few methods for EDR extraction from ECG are reported in literature. In this work, respiratory rates (RR) are derived from Heart Rate Variability (HRV) and Peak Amplitude Variation (PAV) method and a comparative study of these two methods is reported. Moreover, the validation of the proposed methods is made by comparing the obtained RR with that derived from original respiration signal. Subjects from Fantasia database and real-time data for both normal and with pulmonary diseases are considered for the work.Grant: Authors are thankful to Dr. Pranab Kumar Mandal (Head of the Department, Chest Medicine, NRS Medical College, Kolkata-700014), and Dr. Avradip Santra (Clinical Tutor, Chest Medicine, NRS Medical College Hospital, Kolkata- 700014) for real-time data acquisition and classification of the data with pulmonary diseases.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE - : Guidelines recommend continuous ECG monitoring in patients with cerebrovascular events. Studies on intensive care units (ICU) demonstrated high sensitivity but high rates of false alarms of monitoring systems resulting in desensitization of medical personnel potentially endangering patient safety. Data on patients with acute stroke are lacking. METHODS - : One-hundred fifty-one consecutive patients with acute cerebrovascular events were prospectively included. Automatically identified arrhythmia events were analyzed by manual ECG analysis. Muting of alarms was registered. Sensitivity was evaluated by beat-to-beat analysis of the entire recorded ECG data in a subset of patients. Ethics approval was obtained by University of Erlangen-Nuremberg. RESULTS - : A total of 4809.5 hours of ECG registration and 22 509 alarms were analyzed. The automated detection algorithm missed no events but the overall rate of false alarms was 27.4%. Only 0.6% of all alarms indicated acute life-threatening events and 91.4% of these alarms were incorrect. Transient muting of acoustic alarms was observed in 20.5% patients. CONCLUSIONS - : Continuous ECG monitoring using automated arrhythmia detection is highly sensitive in acute stroke. However, high rates of false alarms and alarms without direct therapeutic consequence cause desensitization of personnel. Therefore, acoustic alarms may be limited to life-threatening events but standardized manual evaluation of all alarms should complement automated systems to identify clinically relevant arrhythmias. © 2015 American Heart Association, Inc.

AB  - The Electrocardiogram (ECG) is a diagnostic tool that measures and records the electrical activity of the heart. Interpretation of the ECG signal allows diagnosis of a wide range of heart conditions. These conditions can vary from minor to life threatening. In this paper real ECG records provided by the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database are used to build an efficient mechanism for detecting abnormalities in the ECG records. Prior to the detection, selected filters are used to eliminate any interference while maintaining the useful information within the signal. Detection of Heartbeat-related abnormalities of other heart diseases such as AV blockage and Ventricular Fibrillation is implemented. Results of ECG signal preprocessing and abnormality detection demonstrate the suitability of the selected filtering techniques and the efficiency of the detection mechanisms.

AB  - Background: Traditional approaches to physiological signal processing have focused on highly sensitive, and less specific detection techniques, generally with the expectation that an expert will overread the results and deal with the false positives. However, acquisition of physiological signals has become increasingly routine in recent years, and clinicians are often fed large flows of data which can become rapidly unmanageable and lead to missed important events and alarm fatigue (Aboukhalil et al. 2008). Ignoring the nascent world of the quantified self for now, which itself has the potential to swamp medical practitioners with all manner of noise, there are two obvious examples of this paradigm. First, each intensive care unit (ICU) generates an enormous quantity of physiological data, up to 1GB per person per day (Clifford et al. 2009) More than 5 million patients are admitted annually to ICUs in the United States, with Europe and the rest of the world, rapidly catching up (Mullins et al. 2013; Rhodes et al. 2012). This can be attributed in part to the aging global population. ICU patients are a heterogeneous population, but all require a high level of acute care, with numerous bedside monitors. Patients in the ICU often require mechanical ventilation or cardiovascular support and invasive monitoring modalities and treatments (e.g., hemodialysis, plasmapheresis and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation). With an ever increasing reliance on technology to keep critically ill patients alive, the number of ICU beds in the US has grown significantly, to an estimated 6000 or more (Rhodes et al. 2012). Assuming an average ICU bed occupancy of 68.2% (Wunsch et al. 2013), the sum total of all bedside data generated in the US is over a petabyte of data each year. Multi-terabyte ICU databases are therefore becoming available (Saeed et al. 2011), and include parameters such as the ECG, the photoplethysmogram, arterial blood pressure and respiratory effort. © Cambridge University Press 2015

AB  - Traditional approaches for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) diagnosis are apt to using multiple channels of physiological signals to detect apnea events by dividing the signals into equal-length segments, which may lead to incorrect apnea event detection and weaken the performance of OSA diagnosis. This paper proposes an automatic-segmentation-based screening approach with the single channel of Electrocardiogram (ECG) signal for OSA subject diagnosis, and the main work of the proposed approach lies in three aspects: (i) an automatic signal segmentation algorithm is adopted for signal segmentation instead of the equal-length segmentation rule; (ii) a local median filter is improved for reduction of the unexpected RR intervals before signal segmentation; (iii) the designed OSA severity index and additional admission information of OSA suspects are plugged into support vector machine (SVM) for OSA subject diagnosis. A real clinical example from PhysioNet database is provided to validate the proposed approach and an average accuracy of 97.41% for subject diagnosis is obtained which demonstrates the effectiveness for OSA diagnosis. Note to Practitioners - Automatic diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea based on physiological signals is critical for healthcare service improvement. Equal-length segmentation of signals is adopted in current OSA diagnosis, in which each segment of signal requires inferences from physicians to determine the apnea events. However, this equal-length segmentation may bring possible misdetected apnea events, and finally lead to an incorrect diagnosis. This paper aims to reduce the number of misdetected apnea events by proposing an automatic segmentation rule with consideration of reasonable physiological interpretation. An OSA severity index which can be obtained from signal segments of each subject is designed. An SVM is employed to implement the final diagnosis. To fully implement this approach, it is necessary (i) to preprocess the RR intervals and eliminate unexpected signal points; (ii) to embed individual information of OSA suspects into an SVM. A real world case study has shown that the proposed diagnosis approach provided a satisfactory diagnosis accuracy. © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - Background: Heart rate variability (HRV) has been proposed as a predictor of acute stroke outcome. This study aimed to evaluate the predictive value of a novel non-linear method for analysis of HRV, multiscale entropy (MSE) and outcome of patients with acute stroke who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Methods: The MSE of HRV was analysed from 1 h continuous ECG signals in ICU-admitted patients with acute stroke and controls. The complexity index was defined as the area under the MSE curve (scale 1-20). A favourable outcome was defined as modified Rankin scale 0-2 at 3 months after stroke. Results: The trends of MSE curves in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) (n=77) were apparently different from those in patients with non-AF stroke (n=150) and controls (n=60). In addition, the values of complexity index were signi ficantly lower in the patients with non-AF stroke than in the controls (25.8±.3 vs 32.3±4.3, p<0.001). After adjustment for clinical variables, patients without AF who had a favourable outcome were significantly related to higher complexity index values (OR=1.15, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.25, p<0.001). Importantly, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for predicting a favourable outcome of patients with non-AF stroke from clinical parameters was 0.858 (95% CI 0.797 to 0.919) and signi ficantly improved to 0.903 (95% CI 0.853 to 0.954) after adding on the parameter of complexity index values ( p=0.020). Conclusions: In ICU-admitted patients with acute stroke, early assessment of the complexity of HRV by MSE can help in predicting outcomes in patients without AF. © 2015, BMJ Publishing Group.

AB  - Smart Wireless Body Sensor Nodes (WBSNs) are a novel class of unobtrusive, battery-powered devices allowing the continuous monitoring and real-time interpretation ofa subject’s bio-signals, such as the electrocardiogram (ECG). These low-power platforms,while able to perform advanced signal processing to extract information on heart conditions,are usually constrained in terms of computational power and transmission bandwidth. It istherefore essential to identify in the early stages which parts of an ECG are critical for thediagnosis and, only in these cases, activate on demand more detailed and computationallyintensive analysis algorithms. In this work, we present a comprehensive framework forreal-time automatic classification of normal and abnormal heartbeats, targeting embeddedand resource-constrained WBSNs. In particular, we provide a comparative analysis ofdifferent strategies to reduce the heartbeat representation dimensionality, and thereforethe required computational effort. We then combine these techniques with a neuro-fuzzy classification strategy, which effectively discerns normal and pathological heartbeats witha minimal run time and memory overhead. We prove that, by performing a detailedanalysis only on the heartbeats that our classifier identifies as abnormal, a WBSN systemcan drastically reduce its overall energy consumption. Finally, we assess the choice ofneuro-fuzzy classification by comparing its performance and workload with respect to otherstate-of-the-art strategies. Experimental results using the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia databaseshow energy savings of as much as 60% in the signal processing stage, and 63% in thesubsequent wireless transmission, when a neuro-fuzzy classification structure is employed, coupled with a dimensionality reduction technique based on random projections. © 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - It is well known that there are gender differences in 12 lead ECG measurements, some of which can be statistically significant. It is also an accepted practice that we should consider those differences when we interpret ECGs, by either a human overreader or a computerized algorithm. There are some major gender differences in 12 lead ECG measurements based on automatic algorithms, including global measurements such as heart rate, QRS duration, QT interval, and lead-by-lead measurements like QRS amplitude, ST level, etc. The interpretation criteria used in the automatic algorithms can be adapted to the gender differences in the measurements. The analysis of a group of 1339 patients with acute inferior MI showed that for patients under age 60, women had lower ST elevations at the J point in lead II than men (57 ± 91 μV vs. 86 ± 117 μV, p < 0.02). This trend was reversed for patients over age 60 (lead aVF: 102 ± 126 μV vs. 84 ± 117 μV, p < 0.04; lead III: 130 ± 146 μV vs. 103 ± 131 μV, p < 0.007). Therefore, the ST elevation thresholds were set based on available gender and age information, which resulted in 25% relative sensitivity improvement for women under age 60, while maintaining a high specificity of 98%. Similar analyses were done for prolonged QT interval and LVH cases. The paper uses several design examples to demonstrate (1) how to design a gender-specific algorithm, and (2) how to design a robust ECG interpretation algorithm which relies less on absolute threshold-based criteria and is instead more reliant on overall morphology features, which are especially important when gender information is unavailable for automatic analysis. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Over the past few years, reducing the number of false positive cardiac monitor alarms (FA) in the intensive care unit (ICU) has become an issue of the utmost importance. In our work, we developed a robust methodology that, without the need for additional non-ECG waveforms, suppresses false positive ventricular tachycardia (VT) alarms without resulting in false negative alarms. Our approach is based on features extracted from the ECG signal 20 seconds prior to a triggered alarm. We applied a multi resolution wavelet transform to the ECG data 20 seconds prior to the alarm trigger, extracted features from appropriately chosen scales and combined them across all available leads. These representations are presented to a L1-regularized logistic regression classifier. Results are shown in two datasets of physiological waveforms with manually assessed cardiac monitor alarms: the MIMIC II dataset, where we achieved a false alarm (FA) suppression of 21% with zero true alarm (TA) suppression; and a dataset compiled by UCSF and General Electric, where a 36% FA suppression was achieved with a zero TA suppression. The methodology described in this work could be implemented to reduce the number of false monitor alarms in other arrhythmias. © 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The computer-aided interpretation of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals provides a non-invasive and inexpensive technique for analyzing heart activity under various cardiac conditions. Further, the proliferation of smartphones and wireless networks makes it possible to perform continuous Holter monitoring. However, although considerable attention has been paid to automated detection and classification of heartbeats from ECG data, classifier learning strategies have never been used to deal with individual variations in cardiac activity. In this paper, we propose a novel method for automatic classification of an individual's ECG beats for Holter monitoring. We use the Pan-Tompkins algorithm to accurately extract features such as the QRS complex and P wave, and employ a decision tree to classify each beat in terms of these features. Evaluations conducted against the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database before and after personalization of the decision tree using a patient's own ECG data yield heartbeat classification accuracies of 94.6% and 99%, respectively. These are comparable to results obtained from state. -of. -the-art schemes, validating the efficacy of our proposed method. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Background: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common arrhymia, and it results in increased risk of thromboembolism and decreased cardiac function. In patients undergoing cardiac surgery, concomitant radiofrequency ablation to treat AF is effective in restoring sinus rhythm (SR). This study is an observational cohort study aimed to investigate the safety and efficacy of bipolar radiofrequency ablation (BRFA) for treating AF combined with heart valve diseases. Methods. Clinical data were analyzed retrospectively from 324 cases of rheumatic heart disease combined with persistent AF patients who underwent valve replacement concomitant BRFA. The modified left atrial and the simplified right atrial ablation were used for AF treatments. Of the 324 patients, 248 patients underwent mitral valve replacement and 76 patients underwent double valve replacement. Meanwhile, 54 patients underwent concomitant thrombectomy and 97 underwent tricuspid valvuloplasty. And all of them received temporary pacemaker implantation. The 24 hours holter electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring and echocardiography was performed before the operation, on the first day after operation, on discharge day, and at 6 and 12 months after operation. Results: There were 299 patients with SR on the first day after operation (92.30%), 12 patients with junctional rhythm (3.70%), 11 patients with AF (3.39%), and 2 patients with atrial flutter (0.62%). The temporary pacemaker was used in 213 patients (65.74%) with heart rates less than 70 beat/minute in the ICU. Two patients died early and the mortality rate was 0.62%. Two patients had left ventricular rupture and the occurrence rate was 0.62%. They both recovered. There was no degree III atrioventricular blockage and no permanent pacemaker implantation. Overall survival rate was 99.38% (322 cases) with SR conversion rate of 89.13% (287 cases) at discharge. The SR conversion rate was 87.54% and 87.01% at 6 and 12 months after operation. Sinus bradycardia occurred in 3.42% of patients at 6 months after operation and in 3.03% of patients at 12 months after operation. Echocardiography showed that the left atrial diameter was significantly decreased, and ejection fraction and fractional shortening were significantly improved. Conclusions: BRFA for treating AF in concomitant valve replacement is safe and with good efficacy. © 2014 Chen et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Telehealthcare is a global trend affecting clinical practice in the world. With the progress and development of telecommunication technologies, telecom facilities have afforded telehealthcare a new approach for chronic disease management. The electrocardiogram (ECG) is commonly used to detect abnormal heart rhythms and to investigate the cause of heart abnormalities. To reduce the cardiologists' loading and to provide a continuously telehealthcare, we developed a clinical decision and support system (CDSS) with automatic recognition of the ECG in real-time analysis. In addition, we adopted the approach of noise reduction and feature extraction for support vector machine (SVM) implementation with automatic learning algorithms. The automatic interpretation of ECG could provide assistance to physicians in decision-making, especially with large volumes of data. According to the preliminary results of automatic classification models, we acquired 88.4% sensitivity, for noise detection model, 85.9% specificity for sinus classification model and 89.1% sensitivity for disease classification model, respectively. However, it is not reliable enough to obviate the need for physician's diagnosis and confirmation. We should put much effort on enhancing the performance of ECG interpretation in the future. © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - The proposed system aims at non-invasively measure vital parameters of the ICU patient and make available the real-time data to the physician using the above mentioned protocols. The system is designed in such a way that if due to non-availability of resources if one of the data transfer protocols fails the parameters (ECG, Heart rate, blood Pressure and body temperature) are sent through the next protocol and hence the data reaches the physician and the patient is serviced accordingly The sole purpose of the system is to ease the monitoring system and to ensure proper treatment of the patient in the right time. Another area where the system focuses is that in rural areas very few resources are available which includes non-availability of internet, so real-time data is transferred using power lines from one room to other. Also using GSM technology data can be sent to phone using text message if doctor is not present in the hospital premises. © Research India Publications.

AB  - Introduction: Computerized interpretation of the prehospital electrocardiogram (ECG) is increasingly being used in the basic life support (BLS) ambulance setting to reduce delays to treatment for patients suspected of ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Objectives: To estimate 1) predictive values of computerized prehospital 12-lead ECG interpretation for STEMI and 2) additional on-scene time for 12-lead ECG acquisition. Methods: Over a 2-year period, 1,247 ECGs acquired by primary care paramedics for suspected STEMI were collected. ECGs were interpreted in real time by the GEMarquette 12SL ECG analysis program. Predictive values were estimated with a bayesian latent class model incorporating the computerized ECG interpretations, consensus ECG interpretations by study cardiologists, and hospital diagnosis. On-scene time was compared for ambulance-transported patients with (n 5 985) and without (n 5 5,056) prehospital ECGs who received prehospital aspirin and/or nitroglycerin. Results: The computer's positive and negative predictive values for STEMI were 74.0% (95% credible interval [CrI] 69.6-75.6) and 98.1% (95% CrI 97.8-98.4), respectively. The sensitivity and specificity were 69.2% (95% CrI 59.0-78.5) and 98.9% (95% CrI 98.1-99.4), respectively. Prehospital ECGs were associated with a mean increase in on-scene time of 5.9 minutes (95% confidence interval 5.5-6.3). Conclusions: The predictive values of the computerized prehospital ECG interpretation appear to be adequate for diversion programs that direct patients with a positive result to hospitals with angioplasty facilities. The estimated 26.0% chance that a positive interpretation is false is likely too high for activation of a catheterization laboratory from the field. Acquiring prehospital ECGs does not substantially increase on-scene time in the BLS setting. © Canadian Association of Emergency Physicians.

AB  - In this paper, we present a novel algorithm to evaluate the quality of ECG recordings. Our algorithm is designed to help clinicians in rapid selection of good quality ECG segments from long recordings collected by an ECG monitoring device such as a 12-lead bedside monitor. With some adjustments, we used the Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2011 database in order to compare the performance of our algorithm to the published results. The challenge was aimed to develop near real-time algorithms in mobile phones and provide feedback on quality of the ECGs for interpretation to the users who are mostly laypersons with little knowledge of ECG interpretation. Our algorithm generates a noise score which is a combination of two parameters: a high-frequency noise measure which accounts for the muscle noise and other fast changing artifacts, and a baseline wander noise measure quantifying the low-frequency noise. The training dataset (set A) with reference quality assessments was used to determine an optimum threshold on the ROC curve for classification of acceptable and unacceptable segments. The algorithm was then evaluated on the test dataset (set B) with undisclosed annotations. Our method achieved maximum accuracy of 93.9% on the training dataset and an accuracy of 90.2% on the test dataset, placing itself among the top 10 performers who participated in the challenge.

AB  - The paper presents results of interactive hidden survey of disease-related relevance of standard rest ECG diagnostic parameters. The interactive interface methodology revealed human expert preferences for a particular subset of diagnostic results in context of actual patient disease. We applied a custom-build software randomizing the appearance of the interface, stimulating the expert to a knowledgebased reaction and recording his interaction with the computer. The acquisition of interaction data works behind the standard 12-leads ECG interpretation software and does not interfere with the diagnosis. Only few mouse clicks are recorded while the expert is selecting the ECG diagnostic statements necessary for a final report. Using the interaction recording module we captured 5127 events of decision making, together with patient-anonymized human-annotated examinations in eleven cardiologists' offices. These records yield statistically justified values of parameter's relevance in 16 most common heart diseases and approximate values in case of other 13. The hierarchy of ECG diagnostic parameters may be applied to adaptation of automatic interpretation, to optimization of data transmission and to objective, disease-oriented quality assessment of ECG processing. © 2014 et al.; licensee Cardiology Academic Press.

AB  - Several ECG features are common electrocardiographic markers for manual interpretation of early repolarization (ER) and acute pericarditis (PCARD), both confounders for acute myocardial infarction (AMI). We hypothesized these features could improve automated AM! detection in the presence of ER and PCARD. Method: The training set of ECGs included cardiologist reading of ER (n= 147), PCARD (n= 114), normal (n=239) and AMI (n=380). AMI was confirmed by reading infarct evolution in serial ECGs. The test set came from emergency department chest pain patients (n= 1806). The reference was discharge diagnosis of AMI. Positive ECGs (n=1023) were both STEM! and NSTEMI. ECGs not meeting STEM! criteria by algorithm were excluded from both the test and training sets leaving 430 and 581 ECGs respectively. Two logistic regression AMI classifiers were compared, one using traditional features, another using traditional plus additional features to help detect ER and PCARD. Additional features included J-waves, notches, slurs, PQ segment depression, ST-T concavity, spatial QRS-T angle, and T-wave PCA ratio. Results: As expected, the traditional ST-T features had the most discrimination power. However, the automatically-selected best features included T-wave PCA ratio and the mean anterior PQ segment depression. Total accuracy was higher for the additional feature classifier, 79% versus 70%. Conclusion: Additional ECG features aimed at ER and PCARD may improve automatic AM! classification when STEMI criteria are met.

AB  - Background: The automatic interpretation of electrocardiography (ECG) data can provide continuous analysis of heart activity, allowing the effective use of wireless devices such as the Holter monitor.
Materials and Methods: We propose an intelligent heartbeat monitoring system to detect the possibility of arrhythmia in real time. We detected heartbeats and extracted features such as the QRS complex and P wave from ECG signals using the Pan-Tompkins algorithm, and the heartbeats were then classified into 16 types using a decision tree. Copyright © 2014, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.
Results: We tested the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of our system against data from the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database. Our system achieved an average accuracy of 97% in heartbeat detection and an average heartbeat classification accuracy of above 96%, which is comparable with the best competing schemes.
Conclusions: This work provides a guide to the systematic design of an intelligent classification system for decision support in Holter ECG monitoring.

AB  - Sudden cardiac death in young athletes is a devastating event. Screening programs have been proposed to prevent sudden cardiac death in young athletes. Mortality rates and causes of death differ among young adults and children. Children have a considerably lower incidence of sudden cardiac death. Data lack to compare athletes and non-athletes in childhood, but 40-50 % of sudden cardiac death in this age group seems to be related to exercise. Screening programs including history and physical exam are not very sensitive or specific and will result in important numbers of false-positives and false-negatives. Especially, interpretation of ECG in children is different from ECG in adults, with less accurate diagnoses as a consequence. Secondary prevention by widespread education of simple resuscitation techniques and use of automatic external defibrillators if available will probably save as many lives as any screening program. Conclusion: Sufficient data are lacking to support general preparticipation screening with history, physical exam, and ECG in competitive children. Nevertheless, the impact of such a program, together with secondary preventive measures, should be evaluated in large prospective studies. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - It is estimated that 3.2 million people have developed atrial fibrillation (AF) in the United States and 30% of AF patients are unaware of their diagnosis (silent AF). We tested a new technology for contactless detection of AF based on facial video recordings in patients undergoing electrical cardioversion for AF. The proposed technique uses the facial video signal to extract the beat-to-beat variations of the skin color reflecting the cardiac pulsatile signal. We developed the concept of Pulse Harmonic Strength (PHS) to capture AF patterns from this signal. Also, we quantified the variability of the heart rate and pulse rate using additional measurements of heart rate variability. Eleven subjects (65±6 years, 8 males) were enrolled in the study and 407 epochs of 15 sec. were acquired simultaneously with ECG and facial video signals. PHS was associated with a 20% detection error rate of AF in reference to human interpretation while the error rates of the automatic ECG-based measurements ranged between 17% and 29% across the investigated HRV parameters.

AB  - Virtual Reality (VR) is increasingly being used in combination with psycho-physiological measures to improve assessment of distress in mental health research and therapy. However, the analysis and interpretation of multiple physiological measures is time consuming and requires specific skills, which are not available to most clinicians. To address this issue, we designed and developed a Decision Support System (DSS) for automatic classification of stress levels during exposure to VR environments. The DSS integrates different biosensor data (ECG, breathing rate, EEG) and behavioral data (body gestures correlated with stress), following a training process in which self-rated and clinical-rated stress levels are used as ground truth. Detected stress events for each VR session are reported to the therapist as an aggregated value (ranging from 0 to 1) and graphically displayed on a diagram accessible by the therapist through a web-based interface.© 2014 The authors and IOS Press.

AB  - Background: One-third of stroke and Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) are cryptogenic requiring additional investigation and intervention. Occult Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation (PAF) has been suggested as a possible cause for these cryptogenic strokes. Objective: The aim of our study is to evaluate the role of simple ECG &amp; bedside echocardiographic parameters for prediction of PAF in patients presenting with stroke or TIAs. Patients &amp; methods: The study included 60 patients with non hemorrhagic stroke. During 1week of continuous ICU monitoring, 30% of patients had PAF (group 1), the remaining 42 patients did not develop PAF (group 2). All patients were subjected to detailed history taking, thorough clinical examination including NIHSS, serial ECGs for calculation of maximum and minimum P wave duration (Pmax, and Pmin) &amp; P wave dispersion (Pdis), and transthoracic echocardiography for calculation of left atrial volume (LAV), and left atrial volume index (LAVI). Results: It was found that Pmax &amp; Pdis were significantly higher in group 1 in comparison to group 2 (147.7±9.6mm vs 114.3±9mm, P: &lt;0.001) and (54.1±7.5mm vs 30.2±7mm, P: &lt;0.001), respectively. Also LAV &amp; LAVI were significantly higher in group 1 compared to group 2 (57.1±10mm vs 40.1±12mm, P: &lt;0.001) &amp; (28.9±3mm2/m2 vs 20.1±8mm2/m2, P: &lt;0.001), respectively. On multivariate logistic regression analysis Pmax, Pdis, and LAVI were the most significant independent predictors of PAF. Conclusion: PAF is a possible etiology of patients with ischemic cerebrovascular accidents patients even in those who had normal sinus rhythm on admission. Pmax≥125mm, Pdis≥40mm, and LAVI≥24 are highly significant predictors of PAF with PPV of 99%, 96% and 78%, respectively, sensitivity of 98%, 94% and 89%, respectively, specificity 96%, 93% and 75%, respectively and AUC of 0.99, 0.98 and 0.87, respectively. © 2013.

AB  - Purpose: To demonstrate the feasibility of comprehensive assessment of cardiac arrhythmias by combining body surface electrocardiographic (ECG) mapping (BSM) and imaging. Materials and Methods: This study was approved by the institutional review board, and all patients gave written informed consent. Twenty-seven patients referred for electrophysiologic procedures in the context of ventricular tachycardia (VT) (n = 9), Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome (n = 2), atrial fibrillation (AF) (n = 13), or scar-related ventricular fibrillation (VF) (n = 3) were examined. Patients underwent BSM and imaging with multidetector computed tomography (CT) (n = 12) and/or delayed enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging (n = 23). BSM was performed by using a 252-electrode vest that enabled the computation of epicardial electrograms from body surface potentials. The epicardial geometry used for BSM was registered to the epicardial geometry segmented from imaging data by using an automatic algorithm. The output was a three-dimensional cardiac model that integrated cardiac anatomy, myocardial substrate, and epicardial activation. Results: Acquisition, segmentation, and registration were feasible in all patients. In VT, this enabled a noninvasive assessment of the arrhythmia mechanism and its location with respect to the myocardial substrate, coronary vessels, and phrenic nerve. In WPW syndrome, this enabled understanding of complex accessory pathways resistant to previous ablation. In AF and VF, this enabled the noninvasive assessment of arrhythmia mechanisms and the analysis of rotor trajectories with respect to the myocardial substrate. In all patients, three-dimensional models were successfully integrated in navigation systems and used to guide mapping and ablation. Conclusion: By combining information on anatomy, substrate, and electrical activation, the fusion of BSM and imaging enables comprehensive noninvasive assessment of cardiac arrhythmias, with potential applications for diagnosis, prognosis, and ablation targeting. © RSNA, 2013.

AB  - To investigate the image quality and the minimum required radiation dose for automatic tube potential selection (ATPS) in dual-source computed tomography (DSCT) coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA). Three hundred twenty-five consecutive patients (153 men and 172 women) undergoing CCTA were assigned to either the ATPS group (n = 172) or the control group (n = 153); the control group underwent imaging at a constant current of 120 kV. All patients were scanned in either prospectively ECG-triggered high-pitch helical mode or sequential mode. The subjective image quality score, attenuation, image noise, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), volume CT dose index (CTDIvol), and effective dose (ED) were compared between the two groups with the Student t test or Mann–Whitney U test. The subjective image quality score was not significantly different between the two groups. Imaging noise and attenuation were both significantly higher in the ATPS group than in the control group (imaging noise: 25.6 ± 7.6 versus 15.8 ± 4.0 HU, P &lt; 0.001; attenuation: 559.6 ± 142.0 versus 412.5 ± 64.3 HU, P &lt; 0.001). SNR and CNR were significantly lower in the ATPS group than in the control group (SNR: 23.21 ± 7.40 versus 27.71 ± 8.25, P &lt; 0.001; CNR: 27.81 ± 8.44 versus 33.94 ± 9.69, P &lt; 0.001). ED was significantly lower in the ATPS group than in the control group (ED: 1.25 ± 1.24 versus 2.19 ± 1.77 mSv, P &lt; 0.001). For both groups, ED was significantly lower in the high-pitch mode than in the sequential mode. The use of ATPS for CCTA significantly reduced the radiation dose while maintaining image quality. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Background: We sought to determine if monitoring heart rate variability (HRV) would enable preclinical detection of secondary complications after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Methods: We studied 236 SAH patients admitted within the first 48 h of bleed onset, discharged after SAH day 5, and had continuous electrocardiogram records available. The diagnosis and date of onset of infections and DCI events were prospectively adjudicated and documented by the clinical team. Continuous ECG was collected at 240 Hz using a high-resolution data acquisition system. The Tompkins-Hamilton algorithm was used to identify R-R intervals excluding ectopic and abnormal beats. Time, frequency, and regularity domain calculations of HRV were generated over the first 48 h of ICU admission and 24 h prior to the onset of each patient's first complication, or SAH day 6 for control patients. Clinical prediction rules to identify infection and DCI events were developed using bootstrap aggregation and cost-sensitive meta-classifiers. Results: The combined infection and DCI model predicted events 24 h prior to clinical onset with high sensitivity (87 %) and moderate specificity (66 %), and was more sensitive than models that predicted either infection or DCI. Models including clinical and HRV variables together substantially improved diagnostic accuracy (AUC 0.83) compared to models with only HRV variables (AUC 0.61). Conclusions: Changes in HRV after SAH reflect both delayed ischemic and infectious complications. Incorporation of concurrent disease severity measures substantially improves prediction compared to using HRV alone. Further research is needed to refine and prospectively evaluate real-time bedside HRV monitoring after SAH. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the clinical effectiveness of continuous blood purification (CBP) in combination with ulinastatin for the treatment of thermoplegia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty patients (28 men and 12 women) with severe heat stroke were admitted to our hospitals ICU department from June 2010 to August 2013. The patients were randomized into a treatment group (n=21; 15 men and six women, with an average age of 32.9 years) and control group (n=19; 13 men and six women, with an average age of 33.1 years). Patients in the control group underwent treatments of oxygen inhalation, dynamic ECG monitoring, physical cooling methods (ice caps or ice application), whereas patients in the treatment group, in addition to this treatment, were further treated with continuous blood purification in combination with ulinastatin. During administration, the content of one vial was dissolved in 100 mL of physiological saline for intravenous dripping for 1.5 hours. RESULTS: There were 18 cured cases, one case of sequelae of mild neurological disorders, and two deaths in the treatment group, with the cure rate of 90.48%. In comparison, there were 12 cured cases, three cases of sequelae of mild neurological disorders, and four deaths in the control group, with the cure rate of 78.95%. The overall response rates of rectal temperature drop were determined to be 95.24% and 73.68% for the treatment group and the control group, respectively. Based on the treatment outcomes data, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) recovery, deaths and survival outcomes of patients in the treatment group was more favorable than that of the control group. This difference was statistically significant (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Continuous blood purification in combination with ulinastatin is effective in treating thermoplegia and warrants further investigation.

AB  - Even though it might be beneficial to have continuous baseline data upfront, today's hospitalized patients are put on a vital signs monitor not earlier than they become bed-ridden. The aim of this study is to show the feasibility of a broader monitoring concept, embracing many more subjects, by monitoring contactless vital signs with sensors embedded in non-ICU settings. In order to conduct the experiments, a system was designed to measure electrocardiograms (ECG) unobtrusively by capacitive sensors in various patient fitments e.g., stretchers, hospital-beds and wheelchairs. Contact ECG and contactless ECG measurements by shielded textile electrodes are contrasted to each other to display the potential of contactless monitoring. Our experiments demonstrate that the contactless ECG recordings are of sufficient quality and later used for further standard ECG analysis like QRS-complex detection. We believe that our results are motivating for the potential future care facility featuring a personal, non-obtrusive and yet permanent health monitoring system. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - The patients in the ICU need a constant monitoring of their ECG, Temperature, BP and heart beat. This project is a working model, which incorporates sensors to measure important parameters namely the Temperature, Respiratory temperature, BP, Heart Beat and ECG. The sensors are interfaced to computer, so that the condition of a patient can be analyzed by doctors in any part of the hospital wherever they are. Whenever there is an abnormality felt by the patient, the particular patient will give an alarm signal, by which the doctor can rush to the patient. Even when the patient is in an unconscious condition, all the parameters will be sensed and doctor will be cautioned, thus it reduces doctor's workload and also gives more accurate results. Our project is a working model which incorporates sensors to measure all these parameters like body temperature, Respiratory Temp, Saline Status, ECG and Heart Beat rate and transfer it to the computer, so that the patient condition can be analyzed to by doctors in any part of the hospital wherever they are. Thus it reduces doctors work load and also gives more accurate results. © IDOSI Publications, 2013.

AB  - Automatic interpretation of electrocardiography provides a non-invasive and inexpensive technique to analyze the heart activity for different cardiac conditions. The emergence of smartphones and wireless networks has made it possible to perform continuous Holter monitoring on patients or potential patients. Recently, much attention has been paid to the development of the monitoring methodologies of heart activity, which include both the detection of heartbeats in electrocardiography and the classification of types of heartbeats. However, many studies have focused on classifying limited types of heartbeats. We propose a system for classification into 17 types of heartbeats. This system consists of two parts, the detection and classification of heartbeats. The system detects heartbeats through repetitive features and classifies them using a A-nearest neighbor algorithm. Features such as the QRS complex and P wave were accurately extracted using the Pan-Tompkins algorithm. For the classifier, the distance metric is an adaptation of locally weighted regression. The system was validated with the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database. The system achieved a sensitivity of 97.22 % and a specificity of 97.4 % for heartbeat detection. The system also achieved a sensitivity of 97.1 % and a specificity of 96.9 % for classification. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Objectives: To determine (1) the proportion and number of clinically relevant alarms based on the type of monitoring device; (2) whether patient clinical severity, based on the sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score, affects the proportion of clinically relevant alarms and to suggest; (3) methods for reducing clinically irrelevant alarms in an intensive care unit (ICU). Design: A prospective, observational clinical study. Setting: A medical ICU at the University of Tokyo Hospital in Tokyo, Japan. Participants: All patients who were admitted directly to the ICU, aged ≥18 years, and not refused active treatment were registered between January and February 2012. Methods: The alarms, alarm settings, alarm messages, waveforms and video recordings were acquired in real time and saved continuously. All alarms were annotated with respect to technical and clinical validity. Results: 18 ICU patients were monitored. During 2697 patient-monitored hours, 11 591 alarms were annotated. Only 740 (6.4%) alarms were considered to be clinically relevant. The monitoring devices that triggered alarms the most often were the direct measurement of arterial pressure (33.5%), oxygen saturation (24.2%), and electrocardiogram (22.9%). The numbers of relevant alarms were 12.4% (direct measurement of arterial pressure), 2.4% (oxygen saturation) and 5.3% (electrocardiogram). Positive correlations were established between patient clinical severities and the proportion of relevant alarms. The total number of irrelevant alarms could be reduced by 21.4% by evaluating their technical relevance. Conclusions: We demonstrated that (1) the types of devices that alarm the most frequently were direct measurements of arterial pressure, oxygen saturation and ECG, and most of those alarms were not clinically relevant; (2) the proportion of clinically relevant alarms decreased as the patients' status improved and (3) the irrelevance alarms can be considerably reduced by evaluating their technical relevance.

AB  - Sudden cardiac death in young athletes is a devastating event. Thus, screening programs have been proposed to prevent sudden cardiac death in young athletes. Still, the mortality rates and the causes of death differ among young adults and children. Children have a considerably lower incidence of sudden cardiac death. Data comparing athletes and non-athletes in childhood are lacking, although 40% to 50% of the sudden cardiac death in this age group seems to be related to exercise. Screening programs, including the medical history and a physical exam, are not very sensitive nor specific and will result in important numbers of false-positives and false-negatives. Especially the interpretation of an electrocardiogram (ECG) in children is different from the ECG in adults, with less accurate diagnoses as a consequence. Secondary prevention by means of a widespread education of simple resuscitation techniques and the use of automatic external defibrillators, if available, will probably save as many lives as any screening program. Sufficient data are lacking to support a general preparticipation screening of competitive children with their medical history, a physical exam and an ECG. Still, the impact of such a program together with secondary preventive measures should be evaluated in large prospective studies.

AB  - High-grade aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage patients are monitored in the ICU for up to 21 days, as they are at risk for complications such as vasospasm of cerebral arteries, cardiac arrhythmias and neurogenic stress cardiomyopathy. The diagnosis of these treatable complications is often delayed by the limitations of monitoring capabilities. We applied computational analysis to a cohort of 24 aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage patients, to identify heart rate variability and ECG frequency profiles that may be potential biomarkers of severe vasospasm, reversible cardiomyopathy and death. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Objectives: To test the hypothesis that instituting a process of routine daily review of rhythm alarms in non-cardiac patients in the pediatric intensive care unit would yield clinically important disturbances that would otherwise go undetected. Study design: A prospective observational study was performed over a consecutive 28-day period. Total bedside monitor alarms, rhythm alarms, and heart rate (HR) trends were recorded. Rhythm alarm recordings were reviewed independently by two study team members. Medical records for patients with critical arrhythmias were reviewed to evaluate for prior knowledge of the event and to correlate with clinical data. Results: We evaluated 86 patients (343 patient-days). There were 54 656 total monitor alarms (159.3 alarms/patient-day), of which 19 970 (37%) were rhythm alarms, including 4032 (20%) critical arrhythmias. Fifty-six percent of the critical alarms were artifactual. Seventeen of the 1786 ventricular tachycardia alarms represented true episodes that occurred in 5 patients. Two patients' care were altered as a result of detection of the arrhythmia in the review process. Eight hundred sixty-five (98%) of the 883 true critical alarms reviewed were for extreme HR. Eighty-three percent (5172) of the 6239 true non-critical alarms reviewed were HR alarms. Conclusions: Daily review of rhythm alarms improves detection of clinically relevant arrhythmias in non-cardiac pediatric intensive care unit patients. Copyright © 2013 Mosby Inc.

AB  - Background: This study proposed a fast and fully automatic calibration system to suppress the dark banding artifacts in balanced steady-state free precession (bSSFP) cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) at 3.0 T. Methods. Twenty-one healthy volunteers (18 men, 3 women; mean age 24.9 years) participated in this study after providing institutionally approved consent. The optimal frequency was obtained using sweep scans of transition-band low flip-angle bSSFP (bSSFP-L), performed with three conditions: breath-hold plus electrocardiography (ECG) triggering (BH + ECG), breath-hold only (BH), and free breathing (FB). A real-time feedback system was implemented to allow the performing of bSSFP-L calibration scanning and conventional cine bSSFP within one breath-hold. For each scan condition, the optimal phase was estimated using 20-point and 10-point spline fitting. Results: Linear regression analysis indicated high correlation between the optimal phases obtained using BH and FB and those obtained using BH + ECG (R§ssup§2§esup§ = 0.91 to 0.98, n = 21). The optimal phases obtained using 10-point datasets showed high correlation with the 20-point BH + ECG datasets (R§ssup§2§ esup§ = 0.92 to 0.99, n = 21); although the within-subject coefficient of variation (wsCV) was larger using 10-point fitting. The variation of repeated measurements was largest with FB acquisition and smallest with BH + ECG acquisition. The optimal frequency obtained by offline calculation and by real-time feedback calibration significantly reduced dark-band artifacts in cine bSSFP images (both p <.01). Conclusions: The proposed real-time feedback calibration method for bSSFP imaging is rapid and fully automatic. This method could greatly reduce dark-band artifacts in bSSFP images and facilitate clinical CMR at 3.0 T. © 2013 Tang et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Real-time remote health monitoring systems are experiencing tremendous advancement resulting from improvements in low power, reliable sensors; yet they are still constrained to low-level interpretation. Automatic data analysis continues to be a tedious task due to a lack of efficient, reliable platforms for data analysis. In this paper, we present a system for monitoring patients remotely by emphasizing the strength of Complex Event Processing (CEP) and Situation Awareness. In this approach, the system makes decisions in a declarative way, which helps medical experts to understand the situation in a more realistic manner. The primary objective of this paper is to explicate the different components inside the system. To verify the technical feasibility of each component, the proposed system is implemented and tested using ECG data. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - A 62-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital for removal of hydatid cyst from the liver. Intraoperatively, the patient suddenly became hypotensive with tachycardia and ST segment elevation. There was no erythema, bronchospasm or desaturation. Anaesthetic agents were stopped and oxygen fraction was increased. In view of the recurrence of hypotension, she was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) without completion of surgery. She was successfully resuscitated and acute myocardial infarction was ruled out. She was managed for the possibility of anaphylaxis with hydration, dopamine, antihistamin and hydrocortisone. After stabilisation, she was taken back to the theatre and the cyst was then removed. Histopathology confirmed hydatid disease of the liver. The patient was discharged from the ICU and then from the hospital in 6 days. Anaphylaxis secondary to hydatid disease is uncommon; however, the possibility of such a diagnosis in all patients with non-ruptured hydatid disease in the endemic areas that develop intraoperative shock should be considered.

AB  - Electroencephalogram (EEG) examination plays a very important role in the diagnosis of disorders related to epilepsy in clinic. However, epileptic EEG is often contaminated with lots of artifacts such as electrocardiogram (ECG), electromyogram (EMG) and electrooculogram (EOG). These artifacts confuse EEG interpretation, while rejecting EEG segments containing artifacts probably results in a substantial data loss and it is very timeconsuming. The purpose of this study is to develop a novel algorithm for removing artifacts from epileptic EEG automatically. The collected multi-channel EEG data are decomposed into statistically independent components with Independent Component Analysis (ICA). Then temporal and spectral features of each independent component, including Hurst exponent, skewness, kurtosis, largest Lyapunov exponent and frequency-band energy extracted with wavelet packet decomposition, are calculated to quantify the characteristics of different artifact components. These features are imported into trained support vector machine to determine whether the independent components represent EEG activity or artifactual signals. Finally artifact-free EEGs are obtained by reconstructing the signal with artifact-free components. The method is evaluated with EEG recordings acquired from 15 epilepsy patients. Compared with previous work, the proposed method can remove artifacts such as baseline drift, ECG, EMG, EOG, and power frequency interference automatically and efficiently, while retaining important features for epilepsy diagnosis such as interictal spikes and ictal segments. © VIBROENGINEERING.

AB  - Measurements of the Q-T interval are less reliable in children than in adults. Identification of superior diagnostic tools is warranted. This study aimed to investigate whether a vectorcardiogram (VCG) recorded from three orthogonal leads (X, Y, Z) according to Frank is superior to a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) in providing a correct long Q-T syndrome (LQTS) diagnosis in children. This LQTS group consisted of 35 genetically confirmed carriers of mutations in the KCNQ1 (n = 29) and KCNH2 (n = 6) genes. The control group consisted of 35 age- and gender-matched healthy children. The mean age was 7 years in the LQTS group and 6.7 years in the control group (range, 0.5-16 years). The corrected Q-T interval (QTc) was measured manually (QTman) by one author (A.W.). The 12-lead ECG automatic measurements (QTECG) and interpretation (QTInterpret) of QTc were performed with the Mac5000 (GE Medical System), and the VCG automatic measurements (QTVCG) were performed with the Mida1000, CoroNet (Ortivus AB, Sweden). By either method, a QTc longer than 440 ms was considered prolonged and indicative of LQTS. Of the 35 children with genetically confirmed LQTS, 30 (86 %) received a correct diagnosis using QTVCG, 29 (82 %) using QTman, 24 (69 %) using QTECG, and 17 (49 %) using QTInterpret. Specificity was 0.80 for QTVCG, 0.83 for QTman, 0.77 for QTECG, and 0.83 for QT Interpret. The VCG automatic measurement of QTc seems to be a better predictor of LQTS than automatic measurement and interpretation of 12-lead ECG. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - A modern intensive care unit (ICU) has automated analysis systems that depend on continuous uninterrupted real time monitoring of physiological signals such as electrocardiogram (ECG), arterial blood pressure (ABP), and photo-plethysmogram (PPG). These signals are often corrupted by noise, artifacts, and missing data. We present an automated learning framework for real time reconstruction of corrupted multi-parameter nonstationary quasiperiodic physiological signals. The key idea is to learn a patient-specific model of the relationships between signals, and then reconstruct corrupted segments using the information available in correlated signals. We evaluated our method on MIT-BIH arrhythmia data, a two-channel ECG dataset with many clinically significant arrhythmias, and on the CinC challenge 2010 data, a multi-parameter dataset containing ECG, ABP, and PPG. For each, we evaluated both the residual distance between the original signals and the reconstructed signals, and the performance of a heartbeat classifier on a reconstructed ECG signal. At an SNR of 0 dB, the average residual distance on the CinC data was roughly 3% of the energy in the signal, and on the arrhythmia database it was roughly 16%. The difference is attributable to the large amount of diversity in the arrhythmia database. Remarkably, despite the relatively high residual difference, the classification accuracy on the arrhythmia database was still 98%, indicating that our method restored the physiologically important aspects of the signal. © 2012 Ganeshapillai and Guttag; licensee Springer.

AB  - Objectives: To compare image quality in coronary artery computed tomography angiography (cCTA) using reconstructions with automated phase detection and Reconstructions computed with Identical Filling of the heart (RIF). Methods: Seventy-four patients underwent ECG-gated dual source CT (DSCT) between November 2009 and July 2010 for suspected coronary heart disease (n=35), planning of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (n=34) or evaluation of ventricular function (n=5). Image data sets by the RIF formula and automated phase detection were computed and evalutated with the AHA 15-segment model and a 5-grade Likert scale (1: poor, 5: excellent quality). Subgroups regarding rhythm (sinus rhythm = SR; arrhythmia = ARR) and potential premedication were evaluated by a per-segment, per-vessel and per-patient analysis. Results: RIF significantly improved image quality in 10 of 15 coronary segments (P<0.05). More diagnostic segments were provided by RIF regarding the entire cohort (n=693 vs. 590, P<0.001) and all of the subgroups (e.g. ARR: n=143 vs. 72, P<0.001). In arrhythmic patients (n=19), more diagnostic vessels (e.g. LAD: n=10 vs. 3; P<0.014) and complete data sets (n=7 vs. 1; P<0.001) were produced. Conclusions: RIF reconstruction is superior to automatic diastolic non-edited reconstructions, especially in arrhythmic patients. RIF theory provides a physiological approach for determining the optimal image reconstruction point in ECG-gated CT angiography. Key Points: • Conventional CT coronary angiography suffers from numerous artefacts in patients with irregular rhythms • Coronary computed tomography angiograms (cCTA) were reconstructed with identical cardiac filling (RIF) • RIF reconstructions provide improved image quality compared to non-edited standard reconstructions • RIF theory links physiology with cardiac CT. © European Society of Radiology 2012.

AB  - Myocardial infarction which happens post operatively belongs to surgery is due to myocardial infarctions with hemodynamic instability. The mortality is increased and reduce the survival of patients undergoing CABG surgery that depends on revascularization and ejection fraction. This study was designed to determine the electrocardiogram changes in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft in Afshar cardiovascular research center, Yazd, Iran. In a before-after study, 200 patients who were undergone Coronary Artery Bypass Graft surgery, from October 2001 to 0ctober 2002 in Afshar Cardiovascular Research Center in Yazd, Iran were investigated.Patient s selection was done by Haphazard method that including 145 men and 55 women. Among them 21 patients were treated with off-pump surgery and the other 179 ones treated with on-pump CABG surgery. An electrocardiogram for each patient was done once before surgery, also immediately after surgery (that was in intensive care unit after CABG surgery) and finally when they were discharged from hospital.ECGs were investigated for Q and T waves in Lateral, Anterior and Inferior segments and also left anterior hemi block, left posterior hemi block, left bundle branch block and right bundle branch block. In lateral leads 22 patients had T - depression in preoperative evaluations which was seen in 23 patients in immediately after operation and in 21 patients when they were discharged that it was not significant by chi-square test (P-Value > 0.05). Pathologic Q wave were found in 13 patients with one vessel obstruction category in inferior leads while 28 patients were reported for the same wave with three vessels. In three categorized ejection fraction, 2 patients were found with pathologic Q wave in EF between 35 to 45% and one patient above 45%. In conclusion,We found that Pathologic Q wave and Reversed T in lateral, anterior and inferior leads did not changed significantly in pre and post operation investigations in our study. In this survey among conductive disorders only LBBB changed significantly between pre operation and ICU investigation and also between ICU and discharge-time ones which it may because of cardiac inflammation and edema in CABG procedure especially in first two days after surgery and it can be better just with rest. © IDOSI Publications, 2012.

AB  - An electrical impedance tomography (EIT) system can visualize conductivity and permittivity distributions inside the human body from measured boundary voltages induced by externally injected currents. We have developed a fully parallel multi-frequency EIT system called the KHU Mark2.5. It is based on an impedance measurement module (IMM) comprising a current source, a voltmeter and a calibration circuit. Each IMM is independent and can calibrate its own current source and voltmeter through an automatic self-calibration procedure. We found that the output impedance values of all current sources are greater than 1MΩ at the chosen frequencies. The CMRR is around 96 dB and the voltmeter SNR is between 80 and 85 dB depending. To increase spatial resolution of conductivity and permittivity images, we can cascade multiple EIT systems to form a system with a larger number of channels. They are synchronized by clock synchronization circuits. Physiological events such as cardiac and respiratory functions alter electrical tissue properties. To correlate such events with EIT images, we can perform a biosignal-gated EIT imaging. We can improve interpretation of EIT images by incorporating real-time ECG and respiration signals into EIT images. This may allow us to separate fast cardiac events and slow respiratory events from reconstructed EIT images and also improve the SNR by signal-gated data averaging We present the performance of the KHU Mark2.5 system with experimental results of animal.

AB  - Background Patients with in-hospital cardiopulmonary arrest (IHCA) precipitated by respiratory insufficiency often exhibit bradycardia before the arrest. We hypothesized that bradycardia frequently occurs in the 10. min preceding IHCA and is associated with poor outcomes when IHCA occurs outside the intensive care unit (ICU). Objectives: To determine the prevalence and association of antecedent bradycardia with outcome in adult patients with IHCA occurring outside the ICU.Methods We performed a retrospective cohort study among telemetry monitored adults with IHCA outside the ICU in a two-hospital health system between 2008 and 2010 with follow-up until their discharge or death in-hospital.We defined (1) IHCA as >1. min of chest compressions or trans-thoracic defibrillation, (2) Antecedent bradycardia as at least 2. min of continuous heart rate between 1 and 59 beats per minute in the 10. min preceding IHCA, and (3) ventricular tachyarrhythmia arrests as presence of sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia for >20. s in the 10. min preceding IHCA. Results: Of 98 IHCAs, 39 (39.8%) survived to hospital discharge. Of 98 IHCAs, 53 (54.1%) had antecedent bradycardia. After adjusting for potential confounders, antecedent bradycardia was associated with death prior to hospital discharge (adjusted OR = 3.80, 95%CI: 1.47-9.81, p= 0.006). Among patients with ventricular tachyarrhythmia arrests, antecedent bradycardia was associated with a higher risk of death (OR = 13.1, 95%CI 1.92-89.5, p= 0.009). Conclusions: Antecedent bradycardia occurred frequently and was associated with death prior to hospital discharge in non-ICU hospitalized adults on telemetry monitoring who developed IHCA. © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB  - Respiratory activity is an important parameter in clinical monitoring used in a wide range of areas like intensive care units (ICU), sports performance studies and sleep studies. Common methods measure the respiratory activity by means of facemasks (FM) or Plethysmographie belts strapped around chest and/or abdomen. FMs are often too obtrusive when worn for a longer period of time while Plethysmographie belts lack the necessary accuracy for acquiring the exact volume of air in- and exhaled and are prone to error from artefacts. It has been shown that respiratory induced modulations can be found in other vital signs like Electrocardiogram (ECG), Photoplethysmogram (PPG) and arterial blood pressure (ABP). It is possible to use these signals to derive respiration without the need for additional sensors. In this paper we propose to combine these cardiac signals and compensate for the pulse arrival time to derive the respiratory activity. Employing principal component analysis (PCA) to extract respiration from combined ECG, PPG and ABP can improve the results over single signal approaches. © 2012 by Walter de Gruyter Berlin Boston.

AB  - Newly devices allow the analysis and collection of very long-term electrocardiogram (ECG). However, associated with this devices and long-term signal, are artefacts that conduce to misleading interpretations and diagnosis. So, new developments over automatic ECG classification are needed for a reliable interpretation. The feasibility of the cardiac systems is one of the main concerns, once they are currently used as diagnosis or help systems. In this project, an artefact detection algorithm is developed, dividing the time-series in intervals of signal and artefact. The algorithm is based on the assumption that, if the analysed frame is signal, there is not an abrupt alteration over consecutive short windows. So, the time-series is divided in consecutive nonoverlapped short windows. Over these windows, it is calculated the time-series standard deviation, the maximum and minimum slope. A threshold-based rule is applied, and the algorithm reveals that, in mean, it is verified a 99.29% of correctly classified signal and only 0.71% of signal erroneously classified. Over the results obtained, the algorithm seems to present good results, however it is needed its validation in a wider and representative sample with segments marked as artefact by multiple specialists.

AB  - The electrocardiogram (ECG) is the recording of the heart's electrical activity from the surface of the body and has been worldwide used in routine medical practice since the last century. This is a first-rate tool for a rapid interpretation of cardiac rhythm and for assessment and immediate therapeutic management in patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome, which is a clinical entity that includes unstable angina and acute myocardial infarction with and without ST-segment elevation. Currently, electrocardiographs from various manufacturers are capable of providing automatic diagnosis of ECGs, but there are few published studies about the performance of these equipments. The objective of this paper is to evaluate the performance of an interpretive electrocardiograph in order to determine their suitability for use in a computer system that uses the medical history information obtained by the general practitioner and the electrocardiographic report emitted by the equipment evaluated to aid the diagnosis of acute coronary syndromes, when the patient is not treated by cardiologists. We used an interpretive electrocardigraph Nihon Kohden Cardiofax 9620. The electrocardiograph simulator Metron PS 420 was the choice for the simulated tests, and also we compared the performance of the Cardiofax with a telemedicine system available in a semi-rural area in Brazil. The tests resulted in 93.8% sensitivity and 83.3% specificity that were considered satisfactory in clinical situations compatible with acute myocardial ischemia, validating their use in an artificial intelligence system for the diagnosis of ACS.

AB  - Background. Hybrid PET/CT allows for acquisition of cardiac PET and coronary CT angiography (CCTA) in one session. However, PET and CCTA are acquired with differing breathing protocols and require software registration. We aimed to validate automatic correction for breathing misalignment between PET and CCTA acquired on hybrid scanner. Methods. Single-session hybrid PET/CT studies of rest/stress 13N-ammonia PET and CCTA in 32 consecutive patients were considered. Automated registration of PET left ventricular (LV) surfaces with CCTA volumes was evaluated by comparing with expert manual alignment by two observers. Results. The average initial misalignments between the position of LV on PET and CCTA were 27.2 ± 11.8, 13.3 ± 11.5, and 14.3 ± 9.1 mm in x, y, and z axes on rest, and 26.3 ± 10.2, 11.1 ± 9.5, and 11.7 ± 7.1 mm in x, y, and z axes on stress, respectively. The automated PETCCTA co-registration had 95% agreement as judged visually. Compared with expert manual alignment, the translation errors of the algorithm were 5.3 ± 2.8 mm (rest) and 6.0 ± 3.5 mm (stress). 3D visualization of combined coronary vessel anatomy and hypoperfusion from PET could be made without further manual adjustments. Conclusion. Software co-registration of CCTA and PET myocardial perfusion imaging on hybrid PET/CT scanners is necessary, but can be performed automatically, facilitating integrated 3D display on PET/CT.

AB  - Background: The aim of this study was to determine the frequency and nature of errors made by computer electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis of atrial fibrillation (AF), and the clinical consequences. Hypothesis: Computer software for interpreting ECGs has advanced. Methods: A total of 10279 ECGs were collected, automatically interpreted by the built-in ECG software, and then reread by 2 cardiologists. AF-related ECGs were classified into 3 groups: overinterpreted AF (rhythms other than AF interpreted as AF), misinterpreted AF (AF interpreted as rhythms other than AF), and true AF (AF interpreted as AF by both computer ECG interpretation and cardiologists). Results: There were 1057 AF-related ECGs from 409 patients. Among these, 840 ECGs (79.5%) were true AF. Overinterpretation occurred in 98 (9.3%) cases. Sinus rhythm and sinus tachycardia with premature atrial contraction and/or baseline artifact and sinus arrhythmia were commonly overinterpreted as AF. Heart rate ≤60 bpm and baseline artifact significantly increased the likelihood of overinterpreted AF. Misdiagnosis occurred in 119 (11.3%) cases, in which AF was usually misdiagnosed as sinus or supraventricular tachycardia. The presence of tachycardia and low-amplitude atrial activity significantly increased the likelihood of misdiagnosis of AF. Among the erroneous computer ECG interpretations, 17 cases (7.8%) were not corrected by the ordering physicians and/or repeat computer-ECG interpretation; inappropriate follow-up studies or treatments of the patients were undertaken with no serious sequelae. Conclusions: Erroneous computer ECG interpretation of AF was not rare. Attention should be concentrated on educating physicians about ECG appearance and confounding factors of AF, along with ongoing quality control of built-in software for automatic ECG interpretation. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Although electrical impedance tomography (EIT) for ventilation monitoring is on the verge of clinical trials, pulmonary perfusion imaging with EIT remains a challenge, especially in spontaneously breathing subjects. In anticipation of more research on this subject, we believe a thorough review is called for. In this paper, findings related to the physiological origins and electrical characteristics of this signal are summarized, highlighting properties that are particularly relevant to EIT. The perfusion impedance change signal is significantly smaller in amplitude compared with the changes due to ventilation. Therefore, the hardware used for this purpose must be more sensitive and more resilient to noise. In previous works, some signal- or image-processing methods have been required to separate these two signals. Three different techniques are reviewed in this paper, including the ECG-gating method, frequency-domain- filtering-based methods and a principal-component-analysis-based method. In addition, we review a number of experimental studies on both human and animal subjects that employed EIT for perfusion imaging, with promising results in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE) and pulmonary arterial hypertension as well as other potential applications. In our opinion, PE is most likely to become the main focus for perfusion EIT in the future, especially for heavily instrumented patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). © 2012 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.

AB  - Objectives: To improve screening and quantification of subclinical atherosclerosis in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes (T1D), we investigated the distribution of cardiovascular risk factors (cRFs) and carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) percentiles with regard to sex-specific differences. Methods: This cross-sectional analysis included clinical parameters, blood lipids, and B-mode ultrasound examination of the bilateral mean cIMT using an automatic contour identification procedure combined with computerized analysis. Results: A total of 270 patients were eligible for evaluation (126 females, mean age 13.7 yr; 144 males, mean age 13.8 yr). In the total group, cIMT was significantly related to sex and diabetes duration but not to age. In males, cIMT was significantly higher than in females and sex-specific cIMT percentiles were calculated. Both pulse pressure and diabetes duration in boys and low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), and diabetes duration in girls showed a significant association with cIMT. Conclusions: On the basis of sex differences of cRFs and cIMT in pediatric T1D, the assessment of sex-specific IMT percentiles facilitates a differentiated interpretation of subclinical atherosclerosis. The underlying diabetes and additional cRFs seem to be more important determinants of intima-media thickening than age. To improve the comparability of IMT measurements of relevant studies, the international harmonization of IMT measurements should be aimed for. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

AB  - Objectives: The present study was conducted to evaluate the cardioprotective effect of sevoflurane compared with propofol in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) undergoing peripheral vascular surgery; and to address the question whether a volatile anesthetic might improve cardiac outcome in these patients. Methods: One hundred twenty-six patients scheduled for elective peripheral vascular surgery were prospectively randomized to receive either sevoflurane inhalation anesthesia or total intravenous anesthesia. ST-segment monitoring was performed continuously during intra- and post-operative 48 h periods. The number of ischemic events and the cumulative duration of ischemia in each patient were recorded. Blood was sampled in all patients for the determination of cTnI. Samples were obtained before the induction of anesthesia, on admission to the ICU, and at 6, 12, 24, and 48 h after admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). Patients were followed-up during their hospital stay for any adverse cardiac events. Results: The incidence of ischemia were comparable among the groups [16 (25%) patients in sevoflurane group vs 24 (39%) patients in propofol group; P=0.126]. Duration, cumulative duration, and magnitude of ST-segment depression of ischemic events in each patient were significantly less in sevoflurane group (P=0.008, 0.048, 0.038, respectively). cTnI levels of the overall population were significantly less in sevoflurane group vs propofol group (P values <0.0001) from 6 h postoperative and onward. Meanwhile, cTnI levels at 6, 12, 24, and 48 h after admission to the ICU in patients who presented with ischemic electrocardiographic (ECG) changes were significantly lower in sevoflurane group than in the propofol group (P<0.0001, <0.0001, <0.0001, 0.0003). None of the patients presented with unstable angina, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, or serious arrhythmia either during ICU or hospital stay. Conclusion: Patients with CAD receiving sevoflurane for peripheral vascular surgery had significantly lower release of cardiac troponin I at 6 h postoperatively and lasting for 48 h than patients receiving propofol for the same procedure with significant decrease in duration, cumulative duration of ischemic events, and degree of ST depression in each patient.

AB  - Background: Vectorcardiogram (VCG) signals monitor both spatial and temporal cardiac electrical activities along three orthogonal planes of the body. However, the absence of spatiotemporal resolution in conventional VCG representations is a major impediment for medical interpretation and clinical usage of VCG. This is especially so because time-domain features of 12-lead ECG, instead of both spatial and temporal characteristics of VCG, are widely used for the automatic assessment of cardiac pathological patterns.Materials and methods: We present a novel representation approach that captures critical spatiotemporal heart dynamics by displaying the real time motion of VCG cardiac vectors in a 3D space. Such a dynamic display can also be realized with only one lead ECG signal (e.g., ambulatory ECG) through an alternative lag-reconstructed ECG representation from nonlinear dynamics principles. Furthermore, the trajectories are color coded with additional dynamical properties of space-time VCG signals, e.g., the curvature, speed, octant and phase angles to enhance the information visibility.Results: In this investigation, spatiotemporal VCG signal representation is used to characterize various spatiotemporal pathological patterns for healthy control (HC), myocardial infarction (MI), atrial fibrillation (AF) and bundle branch block (BBB). The proposed color coding scheme revealed that the spatial locations of the peak of T waves are in the Octant 6 for the majority (i.e., 74 out of 80) of healthy recordings in the PhysioNet PTB database. In contrast, the peak of T waves from 31.79% (117/368) of MI subjects are found to remain in Octant 6 and the rest (68.21%) spread over all other octants. The spatiotemporal VCG signal representation is shown to capture the same important heart characteristics as the 12-lead ECG plots and more.Conclusions: Spatiotemporal VCG signal representation is shown to facilitate the characterization of space-time cardiac pathological patterns and enhance the automatic assessment of cardiovascular diseases. © 2012 Yang et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - A cross-sectional study was conducted to evaluate the electrocardiographic changes in 107 patients of acute organophosphorus poisoning admitted at casuality ward of MGM Medical College, Kisanganj from June 2007 to June 2010. Electrocardiographic changes were recorded before the administration of atropine. Prolonged Q-Tc interval was the commonest ECG abnormality, found in 67 patients (62.6%), followed by sinus tachycardia in 36 patients (33.6%). Sinus bradycardia was found in 33 patients (30.8%). Elevation of ST segment was seen in 27 patients (25.2%). T wave inversion was seen in 21 patients (19.6%). First-degree heart block (P-R interval >0.20 seconds) occurred in 9 cases (8.4%). Atrial fibrillation was seen in 5 patients (4.6%). Ventricular tachycardia was seen in 6 cases (5.6%) and ventricular premature complexes in 3 patients (2.8%). Of these 6 cases of ventricular tachycardia 1 responded to intravenous lignocaine, and the other 5 developed ventricular fibrillation leading to death despite other resuscitative measures. All the electrocardiographical abnormalities returned to normal before the patients were discharged. Seventeen patients died. The cause of death was ventricular fibrillation in 5 patients and non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema in others. In conclusion it can be said that ECG should be carefully recorded and analysed in all patients of acute organophosphorus poisoning, and depending upon these changes and other clinical and biochemical parameters, the patients should immediately be shifted to well equipped ICU for better care which will reduce the mortality rate caused by these highly lethal poisons.

AB  - Monitoring serves an important role in ICU as an adjunct to clinical evaluation. It is important that all staff are familiar with their equipment in order to use it safely and to the maximum benefit of the patient. In particular, the settings of the alarms must be tailored to each patient, with consideration to their age, weight and pathology.

AB  - Background: Pneumonia is the leading infectious cause of death. Early deterioration and death commonly result from progressive sepsis, shock, respiratory failure, and cardiac complications. Recent data suggest that cardiac arrest may also be common, yet few previous studies have addressed this. Accordingly, we sought to characterize early cardiac arrest in patients who are hospitalized with coexisting pneumonia. Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of a multicenter cardiac arrest database, with data from >500 North American hospitals. We included in-hospital cardiac arrest events that occurred in community-dwelling adults with pneumonia within the first 72 h after hospital admission. We compared patient and event characteristics for patients with and without pneumonia. For patients with pneumonia, we also compared events according to event location. Results: We identified 4,453 episodes of early cardiac arrest in patients who were hospitalized with pneumonia. Among patients with preexisting pneumonia, only 36.5% were receiving mechanical ventilation and only 33.3% were receiving infusions of vasoactive drugs prior to cardiac arrest. Only 52.3% of patients on the ward were receiving ECG monitoring prior to cardiac arrest. Shockable rhythms were uncommon in all patients with pneumonia (ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation, 14.8%). Patients on the ward were significantly older than patients in the ICU. Conclusions: In patients with preexisting pneumonia, cardiac arrest may occur in the absence of preceding shock or respiratory failure. Physicians should be alert to the possibility of abrupt cardiopulmonary collapse, and future studies should address this possibility. The mechanism may involve myocardial ischemia, a maladaptive response to hypoxia, sepsis-related cardiomyopathy, or other phenomena. © 2012 American College of Chest Physicians.

AB  - Now many remote or underserved areas have brought forward a high demand for improving the quality of ECG interpretation. Telediagnosis can provide a feasible solution. However, even communities already equipped with ECG machines cannot communicate with a remote diagnostic center, because these machines lack interoperability. It can be predicted that the applicability and popularization of ECG telediagnosis could be greatly improved via developing high interoperable ECG machines and realizing a direct interaction between the machines and a remote diagnostic center. In this paper, a detail analysis on the flow of ECG telediagnosis is represented first. Several interactive transactions and a complete and reasonable interaction workflow of ECG machine are designed on the base of the analysis. The design has realized an automatic acquisition of patient information and the transmission of a complete ECG record as well as a diagnostic report. We have created an ECG machine based on the design presented and developed a Web Service named TeleECGService, through which a direct interaction between an ECG machine and a remote diagnostic center can be achieved. An ECG remote diagnosis system based such high interoperable ECG machines has been put into use in a hospital in Shanxi Province of China. © 2011 IEEE.

AB  - During the process of measurement, the ECG signal suffers from several noises, artifacts and interferences, which reduce its quality. Automatic signal quality estimation could permit indentify when the level of noise is high to avoid wrong ECG interpretation. With this aim, several methods have been proposed in the literature. This work assesses eleven different methods for estimation of ECG signal quality available in literature. In addition, three new methods are proposed. These methods were evaluated in a simulated database containing ECGs with different types and levels of noise with SNR values ranging from -20 to 20 dB. From all the quality estimators studied, one novel parameter: Kurtosis, gave the best performance overall the tests. It gave high correlation with the signal SNR (0.95±0.00) and high correlation with the output of a beat detector (Positive Predictivity=0.97±0.00) and high resolution in time (10 seconds of signal length). However kurtosis did not have a high dynamic range. Some methods require some knowledge about the ECG signal (like the position of the R peak) and therefore are not suitable for applications with high levels of noise. © 2011 CCAL.

AB  - We estimate that as much as 5% of all recorded ECGs worldwide may, to some degree, suffer from poor signal quality or incorrect electrode positioning, which often interferes with correct interpretation of the ECG. Proper training of ECG technicians and regular inspection of signal quality is necessary to achieve a high standard. Due to the large amounts of ECGs recorded daily, we devised an automatic ECG quality inspection method based on the conversion of an ECG into a VCG and back again into a reconstructed ECG. Incorrectly placed electrodes as well as different types of noise can be detected with a high level of accuracy. We used this method to assess the quality of the ECGs in the learning set of the Physionet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2011, giving a correct interpretation of the quality of the ECGs of 92.2% which corresponded to a sensitivity of 97.0 and a specificity of 75.1%. © 2011 CCAL.

AB  - The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a diagnostic tool that measures and records the electrical activity of the heart in exquisite detail. Interpretation of these details allows diagnosis of a wide range of heart conditions. Automatic extraction of time plane features is important for cardiac disease diagnosis. This paper presents a multi-resolution wavelet transform based system for detection and evaluation of QRS complex. In first step of this paper we use the selective confident method to find the QRS complex, at next step we use a threshold method to find the QRS complex and finally we apply the composition of first step algorithm and thresholding method which shows robust ability of finding QRS compared to other methods. Achieved overall accuracy of QRS detection for only d4 scale without threshold is 84.48%, the composition of d3, d4, d5 without threshold 93.23%, only d4 with threshold 90%, and d3, d4, d5 with threshold 98.2%. © 2011 CCAL.

AB  - This paper describes an algorithm for the automatic detection of systolic peaks in the Arterial Blood Pressure (ABP) signal. ABP waveform is rich in pathological information such as heart rate, systolic, mean and diastolic pressure therefore it is very important for clinical diagnosis in cardiology. The proposed algorithm deals with the development of energy based technique for the detection of systolic peaks in ABP signal that is of great importance in evaluating heart rate computation and serves as the basis for the extraction of other ABP features. The algorithm has been developed based on the window based energy analysis of ABP signal. This energy domain offers an easy interpretation of the ABP signal for the detection of systolic peaks in ABP signal. The ABP signal under test undergoes window based energy analysis by selecting a window of 100 ms duration. The window is shifted along time axis and the energy of samples falling in the succeeding window is calculated. The areas in ABP signal where systolic peaks are available appear as high energy zones. Window based amplitude threshold and interval threshold are applied to reject the unwanted peaks. The algorithm is easier to implement just after removal of the low frequency samples in ABP signal. ABP signals are downloaded from MGH/MF waveform database and algorithm has been developed on five minute segment of ABP signals. The method has been validated based on beat annotations of five minute segment of corresponding ECG signal from modified lead II. © 2011 IEEE.

AB  - During a retroperitoneoscopic adrenalectomy in the prone position, a sudden increase in end-Tidal CO 2 (EtCO 2) (from 42 to 68 mmHg) followed by an abrupt decrease (from 68 to 35 mmHg) was observed, concomitantly with a right adrenal vein laceration. Heart rate decreased to 30 bpm, and the systolic blood pressure decreased to 40 mmHg. The patient was slightly turned in the left lateral and Trendelenburg position and vasoactive drugs were administered. The systemic blood pressure, EtCO 2, CO 2 elimination (VCO 2) and pulse oximetry (SpO 2) progressively improved within 10 minutes and, at the end of the surgery, the blood pressure recovered from hypotension. ECG returned to normal, with sinusal rhythm and heart rate ∼70 bpm. The patient was extubated and moved to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). This case suggests that gas embolisms may occur during retroperitoneoscopic adrenalectomy, and acute changes in EtCO 2 should alert the clinicians to these rare but potentially lethal complication. EtCO 2 monitoring is essential during laparoscopy, as it may help an early detection of CO 2 embolism, characterized by a transient and rapid increase in EtCO 2, followed by an abrupt decrease.

AB  - Pulse oximetry (PO) is extensively used in intensive care unit (ICU); this is mainly due to the fact that it is a non-invasive and real-time monitoring method. PO allows to measure arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) and in particular hemoglobin oxygenation. Optical PO is typically realized by the use of a clip (to be applied on the ear or on the finger top) containing a couple of monochromatic LED sources and a photodiode. The main drawback with the use of PO is the presence of movement artifacts or disturbance due to optical sources and skin, causing erroneous saturation data. The aim of this work is to present the measurement procedure based on a specially developed algorithm able to reject erroneous oxygen saturation data during long lasting monitoring of patients in ICU and to compare measurement data with reference data provided by EGA. We have collected SaO2 data from a standard PO and used an intensive care unit monitor to collect data. This device was connected to our acquisition system and heart rate (HR) and SaO2 data were acquired and processed by our specially developed algorithm and directly reproduced on the PC screen for use by the clinicians. The algorithm here used for the individuation and rejection of erroneous saturation data is based on the assessment of the difference between the Heart Rate (HR) measured by respectively by the ECG and PO. We have used an emogasanalyzer (EGA) for comparison of the measured data. The study was carried out in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), using 817 data coming from 24 patients and the observation time was of about 10000 hours. Results show a reduction in the maximum difference between the SaO2 data measured, simultaneously, on the same patient by the EGA and by the proposed method of 14.20% and of the 4.76% in average over the 817 samples. The measurement method proposed is therefore able to individuate and eliminate the erroneous saturation data due to motion artifacts and reported by the pulse oxymeter. Specifically in neonatal ICU, it allows to come to more efficient individuation of apnea, hypoxia and hyperoxia events and consequently to operate more adequate and efficient therapeutic actions. © 2011 American Institute of Physics.

AB  - High level of false positive alarms is one of the main issues in ambulatory monitoring in Intensive Care Units. The solution to it is the development of new methods that will be both reliable in detection of anomalies in the patient's state and robust to noise and artifacts. The current study is focused on the development of unsupervised automated approach to analysis of periodic biosignals. The proposed classification method for distinguishing anomalies from normal patterns is based on the combination of time series domain pattern recognition method Singular Spectrum Analysis and clustering techniques. The model itself includes preprocessing, analysis, classification and validation stages and one of its main benefits consists in automated approach to regular features (e.g., heartbeats) extraction without the need of analysing its morphologies, and further unsupervised classification of the obtained patterns. Still, this method has its limitations, as all unsupervised learning-based techniques, and the validation stage requires additional work. The results of testing on the series of biomedical signals (ECG, O2, arterial pressure) from Physionet Database showed that this method is effective in anomalies detection tasks, highly independent of the periodic signal specificity and resistant to the average level of noise. © 2011 Univ of Sarajevo.

AB  - Objectives: Our experience with the use of Warden's procedure for the repair of sinus venosus ASD with anomalous right upper pulmonary venous connection. Method: Fifty-eight patients had Warden's procedure from September 2008 to May 2011. The demographic data, preoperative and postoperative ECG, aortic cross-clamp time, cardiopulmonary bypass time, Holter monitoring, complications length of ICU and hospital stay were analysed. Result: The male to female ratio was 1:1. The median age was 10.9 years (range 2-48 years). Preoperatively all patients were in sinus rhythm. Twenty-six patients had associated left superior vena cava and two patients had also Tuckers procedure at the same time. The mean follow up was 1.2 years (range 1 months-2.8 years). Postoperative Holter monitoring showed sinus rhythm in all the patients. The mean CPB time was 83.6. min (range 54-163. min), mean aortic cross-clamp time was 48.0. min (range 22-112. min), mean ICU stay was 1.26 days (range 1-4 days) and length of hospital was 8.3 days (range 5-13 days) Postoperative echocardiography showed less than 1. mmHg gradient across the SVC-RA appendage anastomotic site in all the patients. No mortality was recorded. Conclusion: This is the largest reported series of Warden's procedure in the literature till date. It is known from other studies that sinus node dysfunction and conversion to junctional nodal rhythm were quite a concern with the conventional techniques and Warden's procedure specifically avoids these problems. © 2011 Australasian Society of Cardiac and Thoracic Surgeons and the Cardiac Society of Australia and New Zealand.

AB  - Personal health monitoring refers to the long-term health monitoring that is performed in uncontrolled environments instead of a laboratory, for example, at home or by using wearable sensors. The monitoring is done by individuals alone, usually without guidance from health care professionals. Data produced by personal health monitoring (for example, actigraphy, heart rate, etc.) are currently used more in personal wellness monitoring rather than in clinical decisionmaking, because of challenges in the interpretation of the long-term and possibly unreliable data. Automatic analysis of long-term personal health monitoring data could be used for the continuous recognition of changes in individual's behavior and health status, and to point out which everyday selections have a negative effect on health and which have a positive effect. This can not be achieved by using sparse measurements in controlled environments.In this thesis, data analysis was carried out for the recognition of physical and mental load using data from wearable sensors and other self-measurements. Large, annotated data libraries were collected in real-life or realistic laboratory conditions for the purpose of the development of practical algorithms and the identification of the most information-rich sensors and signal interpretation methods. Time and frequency domain features were computed from raw sensor data for the correlation analysis and the automatic classification of the personal health monitoring data. The decision tree, artificial neural network, K-Nearest Neighbor and a hybrid of a decision tree and artificial neural network classifiers were used. Automatic activity recognition aims at recognizing individual's activities and postures using data from unobtrusive, wearable sensors. Similarly, the unobtrusive, wearable sensors can be used for the assessment of energy expenditure.The quantities measured in this thesis include acceleration, compass bearings, angular rate, ECG, heart rate, respiratory effort, illumination, temperature, humidity, GPS location, pulse plethysmogram, skin conductance and air pressure. The results indicate that several everyday activities, especially those with regular movements, can be recognized with good accuracy. The energy expenditure estimate obtained using movement sensors was found accurate in activities involving regular movements. The sensors that react to the change of activity type without delay were found the most useful for activity recognition. These include accelerometers, magnetometers, angular rate sensors and GPS location sensors. Automatic assessment of mental load aims at measuring the level of mental load during everyday activities using data from wearable sensors. The assessment of long-term stress aims at finding measures that reflect the perceived stress level, either directly or as observed through changes in behavior. Data were collected with people suffering from long-term work-related stress and participating in a rehabilitation program. Automatic measurements of recovery, measured with a bed sensor, actigraphy and bedroom illumination sensors were found to correlate best with the self-assessed stress level.Careful selection of sensor types, sensor locations and input features played a more critical role in successful classification than the selection of a classifier. Computational complexity of the classifier's classification phase has an impact on the power consumption of a hosting mobile terminal. Power consumption is one of the bottlenecks in long-term personal health monitoring solutions today. © VTT 2011.

AB  - In this paper, a novel nonlinear joint dynamical model is presented, which is based on a set of coupled ordinary differential equations of motion and a Gaussian mixture model representation of pulsatile cardiovascular (CV) signals. In the proposed framework, the joint interdependences of CV signals are incorporated by assuming a unique angular frequency that controls the limit cycle of the heart rate. Moreover, the time consequence of CV signals is controlled by the same phase parameter that results in the space dimensionality reduction. These joint equations together with linear assignments to observation are further used in the Kalman filter structure for estimation and tracking. Moreover, we propose a measure of signal fidelity by monitoring the covariance matrix of the innovation signals throughout the filtering procedure. Five categories of life-threatening arrhythmias were verified by simultaneously tracking the signal fidelity and the polar representation of the CV signal estimations. We analyzed data from Physiobank multiparameter databases (MIMIC I and II). Performance evaluation results demonstrated that the sensitivity of the detection ranges over 93.50 and 100.00. In particular, the addition of more CV signals improved the positive predictivity of the proposed method to 99.27 for the total arrhythmic types. The method was also used for false arrhythmia suppression issued by ICU monitors, with an overall false suppression rate reduced from 42.3 to 9.9. In addition, false critical ECG arrhythmia alarm rates were found to be, on average, 42.3, with individual rates varying between 16.7 and 86.5. The results illustrate that the method can contribute to, and enhance the performance of clinical life-threatening arrhythmia detection. © 2011 IEEE.

AB  - A simple and effective method of displaying blood pressure measurement from photoplethysmography has been developed. The method is developed to be incorporated as noninvasive monitoring of blood pressure from a patient in a intensive care unit. This implementation includes finger tip pulseoximetry probe, differential amplifier, data acquisition card, software filtering, amplification and blood pressure measurement from pulse transit time calculation continuously by microcomputer correlation of pulse transit time to blood pressure. It is expected that the method will be incorporated to a low cost portable personal computer based ICU monitoring system that will also display temperature, pulse rate and ECG of the patient continuously in future. © 2011 IEEE.

AB  - Coronary artery disease is one of its most important causes of early mortality in western world. Therefore, clinicians seek to improve diagnostic procedures in order to reach reliable early diagnoses. In the clinical setting, coronary artery disease diagnostics is often performed in a sequential manner, where the four diagnostic steps typically consist of evaluation of (1) signs and symptoms of the disease and electrocardiogram (ECG) at rest, (2) sequential ECG testing during the controlled exercise, (3) myocardial perfusion scintigraphy, and (4) finally coronary angiography, that is considered as the "gold standard" reference method. Our study focuses on improving diagnostic and probabilistic interpretation of scintigraphic images obtained from the penultimate step. We use automatic image parameterization on multiple resolutions, based on spatial association rules. Extracted image parameters are combined into more informative composite parameters by means of principle component analysis, and finally used to build automatic classifiers with neural networks and naive Bayes learning methods. Experiments show that our approach significantly increases diagnostic accuracy, specificity and sensitivity with respect to clinical results. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - The QT interval is regarded as an important biomarker for the assessment of arrhythmia liability, and evidence of QT prolongation has led to the withdrawal and relabeling of numerous compounds. Traditional methods of assessing QT prolongation correct the QT interval for the length of the RR interval (which varies inversely with heart-rate) in a variety of ways. These methods often disagree with each other and do not take into account changes in autonomic state. Correcting the QT interval for RR reduces a bivariate observation (RR, QT) to a univariate observation (QTc). The development of automatic electrocardiogram (ECG) signal acquisition systems has made it possible to collect continuous (so called 'beat-to-beat') ECG data. ECG data collected prior to administration of a compound allow us to define a region for (RR, QT) values that encompasses typical activity. Such reference regions are used in clinical applications to define the 'normal' region of clinical or laboratory measurements. This paper motivates the need for reference regions of (RR, QT) values from beat-to-beat ECG data, and describes a way of constructing these. We introduce a measure of agreement between two reference regions that points to the reliability of 12-lead digital Holter data. We discuss the use of reference regions in establishing baselines for ECG parameters to assist in the evaluation of cardiac risk and illustrate using data from two methodological studies.

AB  - Background: Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) is increasingly utilized for patients with acute respiratory failure (ARF). The shortage of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) beds, a growing confidence with the technique, and the opportunity to treat ARF in a more responsive phase lead to the application of NIV outside of the ICU. The Study Group on Emergency of the Italian Society of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) promoted a national survey to collect data on NIV use outside of the ICU. Methods: An anonymous questionnaire was developed, focusing on the location and modalities of NIV treatments, organizational and technical aspects, monitoring, estimated outcomes, the presence of protocols, and complications. The questionnaire was mailed to all members of the Scientific Society. Results: Forty-six respondents were from 46 hospitals. Thirty-seven (80%) respondents applied NIV in the Emergency Department and/or General Wards. In the majority of hospitals (72%), training preceded NIV introduction. NIV could be applied in all ordinary wards in 28% of the hospitals. Patients remained in their ward in 89% of the hospitals, and a protocol was present in 70% of the hospitals. Monitoring was usually limited to continuous pulseoxymetry and EKG; 18% of respondents did not have a monitoring standard. Reported complications and practical problems were potentially severe. Few hospitals (15%) collected data on NIV treatments. The efficacy of NIV was perceived as low, as 73% of respondents estimated that NIV avoided tracheal intubation in less than half of the treated patients. Conclusion: In Italy, NIV is extensively applied in non-intensive wards, and its use is not free from criticalities and contradictions. Further prospective studies and possibly guidelines are needed. © Minerva Medica.

AB  - Background: The aim of this study was to determine the frequency and nature of errors made by computer ECG analysis of AF and its clinical consequences. Methods: A total of 10,279 ECGs were collected. They were automatically interpreted by the built-in ECG software, and then reread by two cardiologists. AF-related ECGs included the three groups; overdiagnosed AF (other rhythms except AF diagnosed as AF), misdiagnosed AF (AF diagnosed as other rhythms except AF), and true AF (AF diagnosed as AF by both computer ECG interpretation and cardiologist). Results: There were 1,057 AF-related ECGs from 409 patients and among these, 840 ECGs (79.5%) were true AF. Overdiagnosis occurred in 98 (9.3%) cases. Sinus rhythm and sinus tachycardia with premature atrial contraction and/or baseline artifact and sinus arrhythmia were commonly overdiagnosed as AF. Misdiagnosis occurred in 119 (11.3%) cases where AF was usually misdiagnosed as sinus or supraventricular tachycardia. Among erroneous computer ECG interpretations, 17 cases (7.8%) were not corrected by the ordering physicians and inappropriate managements of patients were conducted. Conclusions: Erroneous computer ECG interpretation of AF was not rare. Attention should be concentrated on educating physicians about the ECG appearance and confounding factors of AF along with ongoing quality control of built-in software for automatic ECG interpretation. © 2011, Japanese Heart Rhythm Society.

AB  - Introduction, One of the most important functions of any intensive care unit (ICU) is to enable patients to arrive at specific, goal-directed endpoints of care. The exact nature of this care plan is individualized based on the character of the patient, the disease process, the unit, and the ICU team; to ensure that care is proceeding along the desired trajectory requires objective data. These data are most often provided by monitors – devices that measure specific physiological variables. Collection of data over time allows for minute-to-minute assessment of trends in a patient’s physiological state. Intensivists, physicians specially trained in critical care medicine, and other members of the ICU care team may have in-depth knowledge of monitors not available to the practitioner, who does not use them on a daily basis. It is important that these non-intensivists understand the utility, indications/contraindications, and basic interpretation of the information provided by the monitors currently in use. Non-invasive monitors do not require significant intrusion into a patient’s body. The most commonly encountered non-invasive monitors are electrocardiography (ECG), pulse oximetry, blood pressure measurement by manometry, urine output, pulse oximetry and end-tidal carbon dioxide monitoring. Invasive monitors are those which require encroachment on a patient’s body such as cannulation of vessels, insertion of neurological monitors, or insertion of pressure monitors. © Marc Van de Velde, Helen Scholefield and Lauren A.

AB  - This paper addresses principles of discrete nonlinear control performed towards the diagnostic quality-based interpretive software optimization for cardiology-based monitoring system. Thanks to the pervasive access to wireless digital communication, distributed biosignal interpretation networks may not only optimally solve difficult medical cases, but also adapt the data acquisition, interpretation and transmission to the variable patient's status and availability of technical resources. The adaptation is based on the innovative use of results from the automatic ECG analysis to the seamless remote modification of the interpreting software. This paper focuses on the static properties and control accuracy and dynamic properties of the ECG processing optimization. It provides also details on the automatic scoring of the performance of ECG interpretation procedures. Testing of the prototype, despite its limited scale, yields significant quantitative benefits and improvement of diagnostic quality. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Data acquisition and analysis of various cardiac/transducer signals based on virtual instrument technology is gaining importance .This paper introduces a novel way of automating the diagnosis of cardiac disorders using an expert system developed on the basis of information derived from the analysis of Electrocardiogram (ECG) and also provides the online monitoring of cardiac patient. Cardiologists use ECG as a definitive indicator of the condition of the human heart using certain well-defined rules and their own experience to diagnose the condition of patient. The decision process is made systematic by developing a visualization tool using proven algorithm for processing the information contained in the typical ECG. The information can be of great help to a general practitioner, to identify the specific problem and start treatment without any delay. The proposed system provides a fast and effective diagnosis of the problem. This has been possible by encoding the expert knowledge and interfacing it with real time ECG available. The system has fast updating facility to track any rapid deterioration, if it occurs and is thus helpful to monitor patients in ICU. ©2010 IEEE.

AB  - You are a nurse working in an intensive care unit (ICU), and your patient, a 62-year-old man, has just arrived from the operating room after a cholecystectomy. He is sleepy but arousable and says he has some incisional pain. You start cardiac monitoring with lead II, as is the practice in your area. One hour later, the patient has ventricular fibrillation. After successful defibrillation, 12-lead electrocardiography (ECG) is done. The patient has ST-segment depression in lead III and 4 mm of ST-segment elevation in leads V3 and V4. You note that the patient's history includes placement of a stent to the left anterior descending coronary artery 3 months before the cholecystectomy and that he had stopped taking clopidogrel 2 weeks before the current surgery. Knowing this information, would you have chosen a different way to monitor this patient? How would you decide what leads to monitor? Is it possible that the ECG changes would have been visible before the arrest, allowing intervention that might have prevented the arrest?. © 2010 American Association of Critical-Care Nurses.

AB  - Critical Arrhythmic ECG such as Ventricular Tachycardia (VT) and Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) are both distinguishable by its waveform characteristics. A VF waveform is often described as disorganized and has an irregular rhythm while a VT waveform exhibits abnormal signatures and presents a regular rhythm pattern. This paper presents a fast cross-correlation algorithm using multiple waveform templates for automatic detection of life threatening arrhythmias such as VT and VF from the Normal Sinus Rhythm (NSR) waveforms. A sliding-window template cross-correlation technique is applied to an ECG signal to generate an array of correlation coefficients. Then a correlation coefficient curve is used to detect high coefficient values for a type of template that will quantify the similarity between an examined ECG signal and a template. The method presented in this paper is able to detect all three different types of ECG signals from a total 21 testing signal set with a satisfied correct rate. © 2010 IEEE.

AB  - Our research concerns the problem of data queuing in telemedical non-uniformly reporting surveillance systems, recently introduced to cardiology. Automatic scheduling of reports was achieved with taking into consideration of two auxiliary data attributes in the information structure: the validity period and the priority, set individually for each ECG diagnostic measurement. The patient-side recorder-interpreter works in one of two reportingmodes: in the delayed mode the transmission is deferred until packets are filled with valid data, while in the immediate mode diagnostic packets are transmitted as promptly as implied by sampling requirements. In the delayed reporting mode, the packet size lasts for 6 minutes of recording, while the wireless transfer session is completed within 10 seconds, allowing for reduction of 94% of required power. In the immediate reporting mode, the packet is collected within 4.63 seconds, which is still acceptable as real time monitoring.

AB  - Monitoring cardiac output (CO) is important for the management of patient circulation in an operation room (OR) or intensive care unit (ICU). We assumed that the change in pulse wave transit time (PWTT) obtained from an electrocardiogram (ECG) and a pulse oximeter wave is correlated with the change in stroke volume (SV), from which CO is derived. The present study reports the verification of this hypothesis using a hemodynamic analysis theory and animal study. PWTT consists of a pre-ejection period (PEP), the pulse transit time through an elasticity artery (T1), and the pulse transit time through peripheral resistance arteries (T2). We assumed a consistent negative correlation between PWTT and SV under all conditions of varying circulatory dynamics. The equation for calculating SV from PWTT was derived based on the following procedures. 1. Approximating SV using a linear equation of PWTT. 2. The slope and y-intercept of the above equation were determined under consideration of vessel compliance (SV was divided by Pulse Pressure (PP)), animal type, and the inherent relationship between PP and PWTT. Animal study was performed to verify the above-mentioned assumption. The correlation coefficient of PWTT and SV became r = - 0.710 (p &lt; 0.001), and a good correlation was admitted. It has been confirmed that accurate continuous CO and SV measurement is only possible by monitoring regular clinical parameters (ECG, SpO2, and NIBP). © 2010 IEEE.

AB  - Background: In patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery (CABGS), occurrence of atrial fibrillation (AF) is common in the postoperative period and is associated with increased morbidity with longer intensive unit care (ICU) and hospital stay. Prevention with antiarrhythmic drugs is of limited success and associated with significant side effects. Therefore alternative approaches, such as Bachmann Bundle pacing, are required. Methods and Results: 154 consecutive patients, mean age 58±8.8 years, including 134 males and 20 females, were randomized to three groups; Group I: No pacing n= 54, Group II: RA pacing n= 52, Group III: Bachmann Bundle pacing n= 48. All the groups were well matched with regard to age, left atrial size, ejection fraction and use of beta blockers. Patients in Groups II and III were continually paced at a rate of 100 beats per minute (bpm) or at 10 bpm more than patients' intrinsic heart rate. All the patients were monitored for 72 hours by telemetry and occurrence of AF was noted. Incidence of AF was 0% (none of 48 patients) in Group III as compared to 16.6% in Group I (9 of 54 patients) (p 0.003) and 12.5% in Group II (5 of 52 patients) (p 0.03). There was a trend towards shorter ICU stay in Group III (3.9 days) ascompared to Group II (4.5 days) and Group I (4.1 days). Among the three groups, the reductionin mean P wave duration also was greater in Bachmann bundle paced group. Conclusion: In patients undergoing CABGS, Bachmann bundle pacing is superior to right atrial/ no pacing in the post operative period for preventing occurrence of AF and reducing ICU stay,commensurate with a reduction in mean P wave duration on surface ECG.

AB  - During anesthesia practise the mean goal is effective tissue oxygenation for this reason we use different parameters. In traditional usage we evaluate ECG, non-invasive blood pressure measurements and SpO 2 parameters. In advanced monitorisation arterial, central venous and pulmonary artery pressure, ventilator parameters and blood gas analyses are used. We use the same monitorisation in adult cardiac surgey. During extracorporal circulation (ECC) the flow is non-pulsatile which causes release of mediators that damage microcirculation, acute and deep hemodilution. Based on these phenomena and the patient's underlying disease, balance between bleeding and coagulation is impaired increasing incidence of stroke and cerebral hypoperfusion However according to all risks that we mentioned above, in cardiac surgery with ECC, generally cerebral tissue perfusion monitorisation is never used which is a weak-point . traditional advanced monitorisation. So physicians perform many manipulations to reduce risks, such as increasing mean arterial pressure and cardiac output. These manipulations also bring some other risks. As a result cerebral tissue function monitorisation is very important during ECC, and near- infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) method which is improved for advanced cerebral function monitorisation can be used. NIRS method can be used for cardiac surgery, geriatric non cardiac surgery patients, and also the patients who have diabetes, congestive heart failure and other comorbidi-ties. NIRS monitorisation decreases post-operative cognitive function disorders, ICU and hospital stay and also operative costs.

AB  - Intensive care unit (ICU) monitors have alarm options to intimate the staff of critical incidents but these alarms needs to be adjusted in every patient. With this objective in mind, this study was done among resident doctors, with the aim of assessing the existing attitude among resident doctors towards ICU alarm settings. This study was conducted among residents working at ICU of a multispeciality centre, with the help of a printed questionnaire. The study involved 80 residents. All residents were in full agreement on routine use of ECG, pulse oximeter, capnograph and NIBP monitoring. 86% residents realised the necessity of monitoring oxygen concentration, apnoea monitoring and expired minute ventilation monitoring. 87% PGs and 70% SRs routinely checked alarm limits for various parameters. 50% PGs and 46.6% SRs set these alarm limits. The initial response to an alarm among all the residents was to disable the alarm temporarily and try to look for a cause. 92% of PGs and 98% of SRs were aware of alarms priority and colour coding. 55% residents believed that the alarm occurred due to patient disturbance, 15% believed that alarm was due to technical problem with monitor/sensor and 30% thought it was truly related to patient's clinical status. 82% residents set the alarms by themselves, 10% believed that alarms should be adjusted by nurse, 4% believed the technical staff should take responsibility of setting alarm limits and 4% believed that alarm levels should be pre-adjusted by the manufacturer. We conclude that although alarms are an important, indispensable, and lifesaving feature, they can be a nuisance and can compromise quality and safety of care by frequent false positive alarms. We should be familiar of the alarm modes, check and reset the alarm settings at regular interval or after a change in clinical status of the patient.

AB  - The introduction of slip ring technology enables helical CT scanning in the late 1980's and has rejuvenated CT's role in diagnostic imaging. Helical CT scanning has made possible whole body scanning in a single breath hold and computed tomography angiography (CTA) which has replaced invasive catheter based angiography in many cases because of its easy of operation and lesser risk to patients. However, a series of recent articles and accidents have heightened the concern of radiation risk from CT scanning. Undoubtedly, the radiation dose from CT studies, in particular, CCTA studies, are among the highest dose studies in diagnostic imaging. Nevertheless, CT has remained the workhorse of diagnostic imaging in emergent and non-emergent situations because of their ubiquitous presence in medical facilities from large academic to small regional hospitals and their round the clock accessibility due to their ease of use for both staff and patients as compared to MR scanners. The legitimate concern of radiation dose has sparked discussions on the risk vs benefit of CT scanning. It is recognized that newer CT applications, like CCTA and perfusion, will be severely curtailed unless radiation dose is reduced. This paper discusses the various hardware and software techniques developed to reduce radiation dose to patients in CT scanning. The current average effective dose of a CT study is ∼10 mSv, with the implementation of dose reduction techniques discussed herein; it is realistic to expect that the average effective dose may be decreased by 2-3 fold. © 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB  - To present an efficient and robust method for 3-D reconstruction of the coronary artery tree from multiple ECG-gated views of an X-ray angiography. 2-D coronary artery centerlines are extracted automatically from X-ray projection images using an enhanced multi-scale analysis. For the difficult data with low vessel contrast, a semi-automatic tool based on fast marching method is implemented to allow manual correction of automatically-extracted 2-D centerlines. First, we formulate the 3-D symbolic reconstruction of coronary arteries from multiple views as an energy minimization problem incorporating a soft epipolar line constraint and a smoothness term evaluated in 3-D. The proposed formulation results in the robustness of the reconstruction to the imperfectness in 2-D centerline extraction, as well as the reconstructed coronary artery tree being inherently smooth in 3-D. We further propose to solve the energy minimization problem using α-expansion moves of Graph Cuts, a powerful optimization technique that yields a local minimum in a strong sense at a relatively low computational complexity. We show experimental results on a synthetic coronary phantom, a porcine data set and 11 patient data sets. For the coronary phantom, results obtained using different number of views are presented. 3-D reconstruction error evaluated by the mean plus one standard deviation is below one millimeter when 4 or more views are used. For real data, reconstruction using 4 to 5 views and 256 depth labels averaged around 12 s on a computer with 2.13 GHz Intel Pentium M and achieves a mean 2-D back-projection error of 1.18 mm (ranging from 0.84 to 1.71 mm) in 12 cases. The accuracy for multi-view reconstruction of the coronary artery tree as reported from the phantom and patient studies is promising, and the efficiency is significantly improved compared to other approaches reported in the literature, which range from a few to tens of minutes. Visually good and smooth reconstruction is demonstrated. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, B.V.

AB  - Background. Telemedicine is a relatively young way of practising medicine based on data remote transfer. High density ECG (ECG-HD) is the method that allows improving signal resolution according to the standard one. In our department we have found this technique interesting and potentially helpful for family doctors, and we have decided to check its reliability. Material and methods. 48 healthy students took part in the survey - 23 male and 25 female - aged 20-27. All participants have negated presence of arterial hypertension, ischemic heart disease, and dysrythmia. ECG-HD was performed by the skilled medical stuff. Results. Automatic computerised interpretation of the ECG-HD signal has revealed that 89.6% of analyses might have ischemic heart disorders. Meanwhile an intern skilled in ECG reading has excluded such possibility in all ECG records. Conclusions. We find ECG-HD not useful in family medicine practice due to its very low specificity and oversensitivity in diagnosing ischemic heart disorders. © Wydawnictwo Continuo.

AB  - Purpose: To evaluate the feasibility of an automatic, whole-heart segmentation algorithm for measuring global heart function from gated, whole-chest MDCT images. Material and methods: 15 patients with suspicion of PE underwent whole-chest contrast-enhanced MDCT with retrospective ECG synchronization. Two observers computed right and left ventricular functional indices using a semi-manual and an automatic whole-heart segmentation algorithm. The two techniques were compared using Bland-Altman analysis and paired Student's t-test. Measurement reproducibility was calculated using intraclass correlation coefficient. Results: Ventricular analysis with automatic segmentation was successful in 13/15 (86%) and in 15/15 (100%) patients for the right ventricle and left ventricle, respectively. Reproducibility of measurements for both ventricles was perfect (ICC: 1.00) and very good for automatic and semi-manual measurements, respectively. Ventricular volumes and functional indices except right ventricular ejection fraction obtained from the automatic method were significantly higher for the RV compared to the semi-manual methods. Conclusions: The automatic, whole-heart segmentation algorithm enabled highly reproducible global heart function to be rapidly obtained in patients undergoing gated whole-chest MDCT for assessment of acute chest pain with suspicion of pulmonary embolism. © 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB  - Objective: The amplitude of R-wave in DII lead (RDII) has been shown to correlate to central blood volume in animal and healthy volunteers. The aim of this study was to assess if change in RDII (ΔRDII) after passive leg rise (PLR) and fluid loading would allow detecting preload dependence in intensive care ventilated patients. This parameter was compared to concomitant changes in pulse arterial pressure (ΔPP). Methods: Observational study in 40 stable sedated and ventilated cardiac surgery patients studied postoperatively. In line with our routine practice we performed a 45° passive leg rise (PLR1) to detect preload dependence. If cardiac index or DPP rose more than 12 and 13%, respectively, the patient was declared as non-responder (NR) to fluid loading. If these criteria were not met, they were declared as responders (R) and received a 500 ml of gelatin fluid loading (FL) followed by a second passive leg rise (PLR2). Hemodynamic parameters were assessed during each maneuver using their indwelling Swan-Ganz and radial catheter. Results: We identified 16 R and 24 NR whose hemodynamic parameters did not differ at basal condition, except ΔPP (19% ± 7 in R vs. 7% ± 4 in NR, P ± 0.001). PLR1 did not elicit any hemodynamic change in NR. In R, DPP decreased and SV rose, both significantly (P < 0.001) whereas ΔRDII did not vary. FL induced a more pronounced change in these parameters. Conclusions: ΔRDII in response to PLR does not successfully help identifying preload dependent patients contrarily to ΔPP or change in stroke volume. © Springer 2010.

AB  - A fully automated, intrinsic gating algorithm for small animal cone-beam CT is described and evaluated. A parameter representing the organ motion, derived from the raw projection images, is used for both cardiac and respiratory gating. The proposed algorithm makes it possible to reconstruct motion-corrected still images as well as to generate four-dimensional (4D) datasets representing the cardiac and pulmonary anatomy of free-breathing animals without the use of electrocardiogram (ECG) or respiratory sensors. Variation analysis of projections from several rotations is used to place a region of interest (ROI) on the diaphragm. The ROI is cranially extended to include the heart. The centre of mass (COM) variation within this ROI, the filtered frequency response and the local maxima are used to derive a binary motion-gating parameter for phase-sensitive gated reconstruction. This algorithm was implemented on a flat-panel-based cone-beam CT scanner and evaluated using a moving phantom and animal scans (seven rats and eight mice). Volumes were determined using a semiautomatic segmentation. In all cases robust gating signals could be obtained. The maximum volume error in phantom studies was less than 6%. By utilizing extrinsic gating via externally placed cardiac and respiratory sensors, the functional parameters (e.g. cardiac ejection fraction) and image quality were equivalent to this current gold standard. This algorithm obviates the necessity of both gating hardware and user interaction. The simplicity of the proposed algorithm enables adoption in a wide range of small animal cone-beam CT scanners. © 2010 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.

AB  - This paper addresses principal issues of the ECG interpretation adaptivity in a distributed surveillance network. In the age of pervasive access to wireless digital communication, distributed biosignal interpretation networks may not only optimally solve difficult medical cases, but also adapt the data acquisition, interpretation, and transmission to the variable patients status and availability of technical resources. The background of such adaptivity is the innovative use of results from the automatic ECG analysis to the seamless remote modification of the interpreting software. Since the medical relevance of issued diagnostic data depends on the patients status, the interpretation adaptivity implies the flexibility of report content and frequency. Proposed solutions are based on the research on human experts behavior, procedures reliability, and usage statistics. Despite the limited scale of our prototype clientserver application, the tests yielded very promising results: the transmission channel occupation was reduced by 2.6 to 5.6 times comparing to the rigid reporting mode and the improvement of the remotely computed diagnostic outcome was achieved in case of over 80% of software adaptation attempts. © 2009 IEEE.

AB  - The aim of this study is to detect Acute Hypotensive Episodes (AHE) and Mean Arterial Pressure Dropping Regimes (MAPDRs) using ECG signal and Arterial Blood Pressure waveforms. To meet this end, the QRS complexes and end-systolic end-diastolic pulses are first extracted using two innovative Modified Hilbert Transform-Based algorithms namely as ECGMHT and BPMHT. A new smoothing algorithm is next developed based on piecewise polynomial fitting to smooth the fast fluctuations observed in RR-tachogram, systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) trends. Afterwards, in order to consider the mutual influence of parameters on the evaluation of shock probability, a Sugeno Adaptive Network-based Fuzzy Inference System-ANFIS is trained using Hasdai et al. (J Am Coll Cardiol, 35: 136-143, 2000) parameters as input, with appropriate membership functions for each parameter. Using this network, it will be possible to incorporate the possible mutual influences between risk parameters such as heart rate, SBP, DBP, ST-segment episodes, age, gender, weight and some miscellaneous factors to the calculation of shock occurrence probability. In the next step, the proposed algorithm is applied to 15 subjects of the MIMIC II Database and AHE and MAPDRs (MAP ≤ 60 mmHg with a period of 30 min or more) are identified. As a result of this study, for a sequence of MAPDRs as long as 20 min or more, there will exist a consequent high peak with the duration of 3-4 min in the corresponding probability of cardiogenic shock diagram. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - Background: Patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) setting are prone to malignant ventricular arrhythmias. We sought to test whether electrocardiographic (ECG) markers of autonomic tone, ventricular irritability, and repolarization lability could be used in short-term prediction of ventricular arrhythmias in this patient population. Methods: We studied 38 patients with sustained (>30 seconds) monomorphic ventricular tachycardia, polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, or ventricular fibrillation while monitored in the ICU and 30 patients without arrhythmia in the ICU who served as controls. All patients had at least 12 hours of continuously recorded multilead ECG before arrhythmic event. Mean heart rate and measures of heart rate variability, QT variability, and ventricular ectopy were quantified in 1-hour epochs for the 12 hours before the arrhythmic event and in 5-minute epochs for the last hour preevent (and using a random termination time point in controls). Results: A modest downward trend in QT variability and a rise in heart rate were observed hours before polymorphic ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation events, although no significant changes heralded monomorphic ventricular tachycardia and no changes in any parameter predicted imminent ventricular arrhythmia of any type. There were no significant differences in ECG parameters between arrhythmia patients and controls. Conclusions: In ICU patients, sustained ventricular arrhythmias are not preceded by change in ECG measures of autonomic tone, repolarization variability, and ventricular ectopy. Short-term arrhythmia prediction may be difficult or impossible in this patient population based on ECG measures alone. © 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to test whether oxygen carriers could decrease tissue injury in a rat model of acute myocardial infarct. The study included 3 groups: SD rats in group II and group III were subjected to permanent occlusion of their left anterior descending coronary arteries; SD rats in group I were subjected to sham-operation. The success of modeling was assartained by ECG. Then the rats were given drug via caudal veins for 2 days. A quantitative evaluation was made with an automatic device for interpretation of cardiac troponin T (cTnT); heart staining was made for the calculation of myocardial infarction size (MIS); and myocardial tissue was taken and subjected to routine pathological hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining for showing myocardial cell injury. cTnT in the sham-operation group was significantly lower by comparison with that in the model group (P < 0.01), and it was slightly lower in the oxygen carriers group than that in the model group, but there was no statistically significant difference (P = 0.18); MIS was significantly smaller in the sham-operation group than that in the model group (P < 0.01), and it was greater in the model rats than that in the oxygen carriers rats (P < 0.05). HE staining of myocardicum in the oxygen carriers group was significantly better than that in the model group (P < 0.01). The evidence suggested that oxygen carriers increased oxygen supply to ischemic myocardium, reduced the myocardial injury, and thus might offer a novel treatment of myocardial infarction.
