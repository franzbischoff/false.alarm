AB  - AIM: Resuscitation guidelines recommend different treatments depending on the 
      patient's cardiac rhythm. Rhythm interpretation is a key tool to retrospectively 
      evaluate and improve the quality of treatment. Manual rhythm annotation is time 
      consuming and an obstacle for handling large resuscitation datasets efficiently. The 
      objective of this study was to develop a system for automatic rhythm interpretation 
      by using signal processing and machine learning algorithms. METHODS: Data from 302 
      out of hospital cardiac arrest patients were used. In total 1669 3-second artifact 
      free ECG segments with clinical rhythm annotations were extracted. The proposed 
      algorithms combine 32 features obtained from both wavelet- and time-domain 
      representations of the ECG, followed by a feature selection procedure based on the 
      wrapper method in a nested cross-validation architecture. Linear and quadratic 
      discriminant analyses (LDA and QDA) were used to automatically classify the segments 
      into one of five rhythm types: ventricular tachycardia (VT), ventricular 
      fibrillation (VF), pulseless electrical activity (PEA), asystole (AS), and pulse 
      generating rhythms (PR). RESULTS: The overall accuracy for the best algorithm was 
      68%. VT, VF, and AS are recognized with sensitivities of 71%, 75%, and 79%, 
      respectively. Sensitivities for PEA and PR were 55% and 56%, respectively, which 
      reflects the difficulty of identifying pulse using only the ECG. CONCLUSIONS: An ECG 
      based automatic rhythm interpreter for resuscitation has been demonstrated. The 
      interpreter handles VT, VF and AS well, while PEA and PR discrimination poses a more 
      difficult problem.

TI  - Heartbeat Classification Using Abstract Features From the Abductive Interpretation 
      of the ECG.
PG  - 409-420
LID - 10.1109/JBHI.2016.2631247 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This paper aims to prove that automatic beat classification on ECG 
      signals can be effectively solved with a pure knowledge-based approach, using an 
      appropriate set of abstract features obtained from the interpretation of the 
      physiological processes underlying the signal. METHODS: A set of qualitative 
      morphological and rhythm features are obtained for each heartbeat as a result of the 
      abductive interpretation of the ECG. Then, a QRS clustering algorithm is applied in 
      order to reduce the effect of possible errors in the interpretation. Finally, a 
      rule-based classifier assigns a tag to each cluster. RESULTS: The method has been 
      tested with the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database records, showing a significantly better 
      performance than any other automatic approach in the state-of-the-art, and even 
      improving most of the assisted approaches that require the intervention of an expert 
      in the process. CONCLUSION: The most relevant issues in ECG classification, related 
      to a large extent to the variability of the signal patterns between different 
      subjects and even in the same subject over time, will be overcome by changing the 
      reasoning paradigm. SIGNIFICANCE: This paper demonstrates the power of an abductive 
      framework for time-series interpretation to make a qualitative leap in the 
      significance of the information extracted from the ECG by automatic methods.

AB  - Computerized interpretation of the electrocardiogram (CIE) was introduced to improve 
      the correct interpretation of the electrocardiogram (ECG), facilitating health care 
      decision making and reducing costs. Worldwide, millions of ECGs are recorded 
      annually, with the majority automatically analyzed, followed by an immediate 
      interpretation. Limitations in the diagnostic accuracy of CIE were soon recognized 
      and still persist, despite ongoing improvement in ECG algorithms. Unfortunately, 
      inexperienced physicians ordering the ECG may fail to recognize interpretation 
      mistakes and accept the automated diagnosis without criticism. Clinical 
      mismanagement may result, with the risk of exposing patients to 
      useless investigations or potentially dangerous treatment. Consequently, CIE 
      over-reading and confirmation by an experienced ECG reader are essential and are 
      repeatedly recommended in published reports. Implementation of new ECG knowledge is 
      also important. The current status of automated ECG interpretation is reviewed, with 
      suggestions for improvement.

TI  - A robust automatic mechanism for electrocardiogram interpretation in telehealthcare.
PG  - 3505-3508
LID - 10.1109/EMBC.2017.8037612 [doi]
AB  - Telehealthcare has become increasingly popular in clinical practice as a means of 
      providing ubiquitous healthcare through long-term informative interactions and 
      health monitoring. We have delivered a synchronized telehealthcare program since 
      2009. We have implemented a web-based clinical decision support system with a 
      knowledge-based electrocardiogram (ECG) recognition mechanism as an augmentation 
      service to assist medical practitioners doing decision making in clinical practice. 
      To evaluate the capability and usage limits of this automatic ECG interpretation, 
      the aim of this study was to validate the stability and robustness of proposed 
      mechanism using stress testing through six simulation scenarios. According to 
      experimental results, both of the processing items and processing time augmented 
      steadily by the resource of hardware. Besides, under the cross-validation using 
      327,058 ECG signals from our telehealthcare program, the recognition classifiers 
      yielded 86.8% accuracy in sinus detection and 88.4% accuracy in atrial fibrillation 
      detection. In the future, this prominent mechanism of automatic ECG interpretation 
      could widely offer high accessibility in the field of medical service. The findings 
      of the present study also encourage and augment further support to implementation of 
      screening and monitoring as part of telehealthcare.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Telehealth care is a global trend affecting clinical practice around the 
      world. To mitigate the workload of health professionals and provide ubiquitous 
      health care, a comprehensive surveillance system with value-added services based on 
      information technologies must be established. OBJECTIVE: We conducted this study to 
      describe our proposed telesurveillance system designed for monitoring and 
      classifying electrocardiogram (ECG) signals and to evaluate the performance of ECG 
      classification. METHODS: We established a telesurveillance system with an automatic 
      ECG interpretation mechanism. The system included: (1) automatic ECG signal 
      transmission via telecommunication, (2) ECG signal processing, including noise 
      elimination, peak estimation, and feature extraction, (3) automatic ECG 
      interpretation based on the support vector machine (SVM) classifier and rule-based 
      processing, and (4) display of ECG signals and their analyzed results. We analyzed 
      213,420 ECG signals that were diagnosed by cardiologists as the gold standard to 
      verify the classification performance. RESULTS: In the clinical ECG database from 
      the Telehealth Center of the National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH), the 
      experimental results showed that the ECG classifier yielded a specificity value of 
      96.66% for normal rhythm detection, a sensitivity value of 98.50% for disease 
      recognition, and an accuracy value of 81.17% for noise detection. For the detection 
      performance of specific diseases, the recognition model mainly generated sensitivity 
      values of 92.70% for atrial fibrillation, 89.10% for pacemaker rhythm, 88.60% for 
      atrial premature contraction, 72.98% for T-wave inversion, 62.21% for atrial 
      flutter, and 62.57% for first-degree atrioventricular block. CONCLUSIONS: Through 
      connected telehealth care devices, the telesurveillance system, and the automatic 
      ECG interpretation system, this mechanism was intentionally designed for continuous 
      decision-making support and is reliable enough to reduce the need for face-to-face 
      diagnosis. With this value-added service, the system could widely assist physicians 
      and other health professionals with decision making in clinical practice. The system 
      will be very helpful for the patient who suffers from cardiac disease, but for whom 
      it is inconvenient to go to the hospital very often.

AB  - Computerized interpretation of the electrocardiogram (ECG) began in the 1950s when 
      conversion of its analog signal to digital form became available. Since then, 
      automatic computer interpretations of the ECG have become routine, even at the point 
      of care, by the addition of interpretive algorithms to portable ECG carts. Now, more 
      than 100 million computerized ECG interpretations are recorded yearly in the United 
      States. These interpretations have contributed to medical care by reducing physician 
      reading time and accurately interpreting most normal ECGs. But errors do occur. The 
      computer cannot be held responsible for misinterpretations due to recording errors, 
      such as muscle artifacts or lead reversal. But, in many abnormal ECGs, the computer 
      makes its own errors-sometimes critical-in its incorrect detection of arrhythmias, 
      pacemakers, and myocardial infarctions. These errors require that all computerized 
      statements be over-read by trained physicians who have the advantage of clinical 
      context, unavailable to the computer. Together, the computer and over-readers now 
      provide the most accurate ECG interpretations available.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Handheld ECG recorders may have algorithms which automatically inform 
      the user of presence of arrhythmia. The main objectives of this study were to 
      evaluate the accuracy of the arrhythmia diagnosis algorithm of Beurer ME90 recorder 
      to diagnose atrial fibrillation (AF)/flutter, and to evaluate whether recording 
      technique (finger versus precordial) affects diagnostic performance. METHODS: 
      Consecutive patients admitted at the cardiology ward of a tertiary care hospital 
      were enrolled. Handheld ECG recordings were performed by holding the device between 
      index fingers (lead I), and by applying it to the chest (modified V4, mV4), with 
      12‑lead ECGs serving as the gold standard for presence of arrhythmia. RESULTS: A 
      total of 127 patients were included. The automatic arrhythmia detection algorithm 
      identified all 16 cases of AF, but specificity was poor (62-77%, with slightly 
      better specificity of mV4 compared to lead I). Specificity improved to 84% (95% CI 
      76-91%) if both lead I and mV4 recordings had to be positive for diagnosis, with a 
      positive predictive value of 48% (95% CI 30-67%). Interpretation of the tracings by 
      an electrophysiologist was 100% specific. Atrial flutter with regular ventricular 
      response was however missed by automatic and manual interpretation. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      automatic arrhythmia algorithm of the BeurerME90 device has excellent sensitivity 
      for diagnosing AF, but with low specificity. Strategies such as first recording lead 
      I (more practical to perform), and in case of arrhythmia detection, confirming with 
      an mV4 recording, may be applied to reduce false positive readings requiring manual 
      confirmation by a healthcare professional.

AB  - The conduction system includes a primary pacemaker, the internodal tracts, the 
      atrioventricular node, and the His bundle with the right and left branches. In 
      "emergency" conditions, accessory pacemakers may be triggered. The conduction system 
      produces very low-intensity currents; a surface electrocardiogram (ECG) detects only 
      the big myocardial masses. Electrogenetic mechanisms are reduced automaticity and/or 
      impaired conduction at the base of bradycardias. An increased automaticity and/or 
      reentry phenomenon are at the base of ectopic beats and tachycardias. A "wide QRS" 
      is a ventricular activation time of 120 milliseconds or more. The "laddergram" helps 
      in the fast and reliable ECG interpretation.

AB  - Due to its simplicity and low cost, analyzing an electrocardiogram (ECG) is the most 
      common technique for detecting cardiac arrhythmia. The massive amount of ECG data 
      collected every day, in home and hospital, may preclude data review by human 
      operators/technicians. Therefore, several methods are proposed for either fully 
      automatic arrhythmia detection or event selection for further verification by human 
      experts. Traditional machine learning approaches have made significant progress in 
      the past years. However, those methods rely on hand-crafted feature extraction, 
      which requires in-depth domain knowledge and preprocessing of the signal (e.g., beat 
      detection). This, plus the high variability in wave morphology among patients and 
      the presence of noise, make it challenging for computerized interpretation to 
      achieve high accuracy. Recent advances in deep learning make it possible to perform 
      automatic high-level feature extraction and classification. Therefore, deep learning 
      approaches have gained interest in arrhythmia detection. In this work, we reviewed 
      the recent advancement of deep learning methods for automatic arrhythmia detection. 
      We summarized existing literature from five aspects: utilized dataset, application, 
      type of input data, model architecture, and performance evaluation. We also reported 
      limitations of reviewed papers and potential future opportunities.

      ECG measurements?

AB  - It is well known that there are gender differences in 12 lead ECG measurements, some 
      of which can be statistically significant. It is also an accepted practice that we 
      should consider those differences when we interpret ECGs, by either a human 
      overreader or a computerized algorithm. There are some major gender differences in 
      12 lead ECG measurements based on automatic algorithms, including global 
      measurements such as heart rate, QRS duration, QT interval, and lead-by-lead 
      measurements like QRS amplitude, ST level, etc. The interpretation criteria used in 
      the automatic algorithms can be adapted to the gender differences in the 
      measurements. The analysis of a group of 1339 patients with acute inferior MI showed 
      that for patients under age 60, women had lower ST elevations at the J point in lead 
      II than men (57±91μV vs. 86±117μV, p<0.02). This trend was reversed for patients 
      over age 60 (lead aVF: 102±126μV vs. 84±117μV, p<0.04; lead III: 130±146μV vs. 
      103±131μV, p<0.007). Therefore, the ST elevation thresholds were set based on 
      available gender and age information, which resulted in 25% relative sensitivity 
      improvement for women under age 60, while maintaining a high specificity of 98%. 
      Similar analyses were done for prolonged QT interval and LVH cases. The paper uses 
      several design examples to demonstrate (1) how to design a gender-specific 
      algorithm, and (2) how to design a robust ECG interpretation algorithm which relies 
      less on absolute threshold-based criteria and is instead more reliant on overall 
      morphology features, which are especially important when gender information is 
      unavailable for automatic analysis.

TI  - A decision support system and rule-based algorithm to augment the human 
      interpretation of the 12-lead electrocardiogram.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The 12-lead Electrocardiogram (ECG) has been used to detect cardiac 
      abnormalities in the same format for more than 70years. However, due to the complex 
      nature of 12-lead ECG interpretation, there is a significant cognitive workload 
      required from the interpreter. This complexity in ECG interpretation often leads to 
      errors in diagnosis and subsequent treatment. We have previously reported on the 
      development of an ECG interpretation support system designed to augment the human 
      interpretation process. This computerised decision support system has been named 
      'Interactive Progressive based Interpretation' (IPI). In this study, a decision 
      support algorithm was built into the IPI system to suggest potential diagnoses based 
      on the interpreter's annotations of the 12-lead ECG. We hypothesise semi-automatic 
      interpretation using a digital assistant can be an optimal man-machine model for ECG 
      interpretation. OBJECTIVES: To improve interpretation accuracy and reduce missed 
      co-abnormalities. METHODS: The Differential Diagnoses Algorithm (DDA) was developed 
      using web technologies where diagnostic ECG criteria are defined in an open storage 
      format, Javascript Object Notation (JSON), which is queried using a rule-based 
      reasoning algorithm to suggest diagnoses. To test our hypothesis, a counterbalanced 
      trial was designed where subjects interpreted ECGs using the conventional approach 
      and using the IPI+DDA approach. RESULTS: A total of 375 interpretations were 
      collected. The IPI+DDA approach was shown to improve diagnostic accuracy by 8.7% 
      (although not statistically significant, p-value=0.1852), the IPI+DDA suggested the 
      correct interpretation more often than the human interpreter in 7/10 cases (varying 
      statistical significance). Human interpretation accuracy increased to 70% when seven 
      suggestions were generated. CONCLUSION: Although results were not found to be 
      statistically significant, we found; 1) our decision support tool increased the 
      number of correct interpretations, 2) the DDA algorithm suggested the correct 
      interpretation more often than humans, and 3) as many as 7 computerised diagnostic 
      suggestions augmented human decision making in ECG interpretation. Statistical 
      significance may be achieved by expanding sample size.

AB  - About 50 years ago, Norman Jefferis Holter invented a device that opened the 
      possibility of recording heart activity over long periods of time. This invention, 
      together with the rapid developments in electronics, has enabled a revolutionary 
      change in the diagnosis and management of cardiac diseases. Ambulatory cardiac 
      monitors have decreased in size to the point of becoming wearable or implantable and 
      are able to monitor heart activity for months or even years. In addition, new 
      telecommunication systems allow clinicians to remotely access cardiac events and to 
      respond within a short period of time. Novel advances in computing and algorithm 
      development are expanding the clinical applications of ambulatory devices with more 
      complex automatic interpretation of the electrocardiographic signal. This article 
      reviews the state of the art of these techniques from both clinical and technical 
      approaches, covering a historic perspective up to today, and discusses current 
      applications, challenges, and future directions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Electrocardiogram ECG is one of the most important non-invasive 
      tools for cardiac diseases diagnosis. Taking advantage of the developed 
      telecommunication infrastructure, several approaches that address the development of 
      telemetry cardiac devices were introduced recently. Telemetry ECG devices allow easy 
      and fast ECG monitoring of patients with suspected cardiac issues. Choosing the 
      right device with the desired working mode, signal quality, and the device cost are 
      still the main obstacles to massive usage of these devices. METHODS: In this paper, 
      we introduce design, implementation, and validation of a multi-purpose telemetry 
      system for recording, transmission, and interpretation of ECG signals in different 
      recording modes. The system consists of an ECG device, a cloud-based analysis 
      pipeline, and accompanied mobile applications for physicians and patients. The 
      proposed ECG device's mechanical design allows laypersons to easily record 
      post-event short-term ECG signals, using dry electrodes without any preparation. 
      Moreover, patients can use the device to record long-term signals in loop and holter 
      modes, using wet electrodes. In order to overcome the problem of signal quality 
      fluctuation due to using different electrodes types and different placements on 
      subject's chest, customized ECG signal processing and interpretation pipeline is 
      presented for each working mode. RESULTS: We present the evaluation of the novel 
      short-term recorder design. Recording of an ECG signal was performed for 391 
      patients using a standard 12-leads golden standard ECG and the proposed 
      patient-activated short-term post-event recorder. In the validation phase, a sample 
      of validation signals followed peer review process wherein two experts annotated the 
      signals in terms of signal acceptability for diagnosis.We found that 96% of signals 
      allow detecting arrhythmia and other signal's abnormal changes. Additionally, we 
      compared and presented the correlation coefficient and the automatic QRS delineation 
      results of both short-term post-event recorder and 12-leads golden standard ECG 
      recorder. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed multi-purpose ECG device allows physicians to 
      choose the working mode of the same device according to the patient status. The 
      proposed device was designed to allow patients to manage the technical requirements 
      of both working modes. Post-event short-term ECG recording using the proposed design 
      provide physicians reliable three ECG leads with direct symptom-rhythm correlation.

AB  - The convergence between wearable and medical device technologies is a natural 
      progression. Miniaturization has allowed the design of small, compact monitoring 
      systems that can record physiological signals over longer periods of time. Thus, the 
      potential for these devices to expand the understanding of disease progression and 
      patients' clinical status is very high. The accuracy of these devices, however, is 
      dependent upon the computer algorithms utilized in the analysis of the large volume 
      of physiological data monitored and/or recorded by the devices. Automated 
      interpretation of the data by these new technologies, therefore, necessitates closer 
      examination by regulatory organizations. The current requirements for the validation 
      of novel Ambulatory ECG (A-ECG) annotation algorithms are based on the 
      AAMI/ANSI-EC57 and IEC60601-2-47 Standard. These standards are being updated, but 
      they rely on a very limited set of digitized ECG recordings from a couple of ECG 
      databases built in the first half of the 70's. These reference signals are obsolete. 
      We are developing a validation tool for computerized methods designed to detect and 
      monitor cardiac activities based on body-surface ECGs. We will rely on a set of 
      existing digital high-resolution 12‑lead A-ECG recordings acquired in cardiac 
      patients and healthy individuals. These ECG signals include a large and unique set 
      of electrocardiographic events. This tool is being qualified by the Center for 
      Devices and Radiological Health of the United States Food and Drug Administration 
      (FDA) as a Medical Device Development Tool (MDDT). This document provides insights 
      into the design of the M.A.D.A.E. database, its functionalities, and its ultimate 
      role in enabling the next generations of automatic interpretation of ECG signals.

AB  - In vitro surrogate models of human cardiac tissue hold great promise in disease 
      modeling, cardiotoxicity testing, and future applications in regenerative medicine. 
      However, the generation of engineered human cardiac constructs with tissue-like 
      functionality is currently thwarted by difficulties in achieving efficient 
      maturation at the cellular and/or tissular level. Here, we report on the design and 
      implementation of a platform for the production of engineered cardiac macrotissues 
      from human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs), which we term "CardioSlice." PSC-derived 
      cardiomyocytes, together with human fibroblasts, are seeded into large 3D porous 
      scaffolds and cultured using a parallelized perfusion bioreactor with custom-made 
      culture chambers. Continuous electrical stimulation for 2 weeks promotes 
      cardiomyocyte alignment and synchronization, and the emergence of cardiac 
      tissue-like properties. These include electrocardiogram-like signals that can be 
      readily measured on the surface of CardioSlice constructs, and a response to 
      proarrhythmic drugs that is predictive of their effect in human patients.

TI  - Optimizing Wavelet ECG Watermarking to Maintain Measurement Performance According to 
      Industrial Standard.
LID - 10.3390/s18103401 [doi]
LID - 3401
AB  - Watermarking is currently investigated as an efficient and safe method of embedding 
      additional patient or environment-related data into the electrocardiogram. This 
      paper presents experimental work on the assessment of the loss of ECG 
      (electrocardiogram signal) diagnostic quality from the industrial standard 
      EN60601-2-25:2015 point of view. We implemented an original time-frequency 
      watermarking technique with an adaptive beat-to-beat lead-independent data container 
      design. We tested six wavelets, six coding bit depth values (including the automatic 
      noise-dependent one) and two types of watermark content to find the conditions that 
      are necessary for watermarked ECG to maintain the compliance with International 
      Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) requirements for interpretation performance. 
      Unlike other authors, we did not assess the differences of signal values, but errors 
      in ECG wave delineation results. The results of a total of 7300 original and 
      watermarked 10 s ECGs were statistically processed to reveal possible interpretation 
      quality degradation due to watermarking. Finally we found (1) the Symlet of 11-th 
      order as the best of the wavelets that were tested; (2) the important role of ECG 
      wave delineation and noise tracking procedures; (3) the high influence of the 
      watermark-to-noise similarity of amplitude and values distribution and (4) the 
      stability of the watermarking capacity for different heart rates in atrial rhythms.

TI  - Safe automatic one-lead electrocardiogram analysis in screening for atrial 
      fibrillation.
PG  - 1449-1453
LID - 10.1093/europace/euw286 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Screening for atrial fibrillation (AF) using intermittent electrocardiogram 
      (ECG) recordings can identify individuals at risk of AF-related morbidity in 
      particular stroke. We aimed to validate the performance of an AF screening algorithm 
      compared with manual ECG analysis by specially trained nurses and physicians (gold 
      standard) in 30 s intermittent one-lead ECG recordings. METHODS AND RESULTS: The 
      STROKESTOP study is a mass-screening study for AF using intermittent ECG recordings. 
      All individuals in the study without known AF registered a 30-s ECG recording in 
      Lead I two times daily for 2 weeks, and all ECGs were manually interpreted. A 
      computerized algorithm was used to analyse 80 149 ECG recordings in 3209 
      individuals. The computerized algorithm annotated 87.1% (n = 69 789) of the 
      recordings as sinus rhythm/minor rhythm disturbances. The manual interpretation 
      (gold standard) was that 69 758 ECGs were normal, making the negative predictive 
      value of the algorithm 99.9%. The number of ECGs requiring manual interpretation in 
      order to find one pathological ECG was reduced from 288 to 35. Atrial fibrillation 
      was diagnosed in 84 patients by manual interpretation, in all of whom the algorithm 
      indicated pathology. On an ECG level, 278 ECGs were manually interpreted as AF, and 
      of these the algorithm annotated 272 ECGs as pathological (sensitivity 97.8%). 
      CONCLUSION: Automatic ECG screening using a computerized algorithm safely identifies 
      normal ECGs in Lead I and reduces the need for manual evaluation of individual ECGs 
      with >85% with 100% sensitivity on an individual basis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: No direct comparison of current electrocardiogram (ECG) interpretation 
      programs exists. OBJECTIVE: Assess the accuracy of ECG interpretation programs in 
      detecting abnormal rhythms and flagging for priority review records with alterations 
      secondary to acute coronary syndrome (ACS). METHODS: More than 2,000 digital ECGs 
      from hospitals and databases in Europe, USA, and Australia, were obtained from 
      consecutive adult and pediatric patients and converted to 10 s analog samples that 
      were replayed on seven electrocardiographs and classified by the manufacturers' 
      interpretation programs. We assessed ability to distinguish sinus rhythm from 
      non-sinus rhythm, identify atrial fibrillation/flutter and other abnormal rhythms, 
      and accuracy in flagging results for priority review. If all seven programs' 
      interpretation statements did not agree, cases were reviewed by experienced 
      cardiologists. RESULTS: All programs could distinguish well between sinus and 
      non-sinus rhythms and could identify atrial fibrillation/flutter or other abnormal 
      rhythms. However, false-positive rates varied from 2.1% to 5.5% for non-sinus 
      rhythm, from 0.7% to 4.4% for atrial fibrillation/flutter, and from 1.5% to 3.0% for 
      other abnormal rhythms. False-negative rates varied from 12.0% to 7.5%, 9.9% to 
      2.7%, and 55.9% to 30.5%, respectively. Flagging of ACS varied by a factor of 2.5 
      between programs. Physicians flagged more ECGs for prompt review, but also showed 
      variance of around a factor of 2. False-negative values differed between programs by 
      a factor of 2 but was high for all (>50%). Agreement between programs and majority 
      reviewer decisions was 46-62%. CONCLUSIONS: Automatic interpretations of rhythms and 
      ACS differ between programs. Healthcare institutions should not rely on ECG software 
      "critical result" flags alone to decide the ACS workflow.

      clinical consequences.
PG  - 348-53
LID - 10.1002/clc.22000 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to determine the frequency and nature of 
      errors made by computer electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis of atrial fibrillation 
      (AF), and the clinical consequences. HYPOTHESIS: Computer software for interpreting 
      ECGs has advanced. METHODS: A total of 10279 ECGs were collected, automatically 
      interpreted by the built-in ECG software, and then reread by 2 cardiologists. 
      AF-related ECGs were classified into 3 groups: overinterpreted AF (rhythms other 
      than AF interpreted as AF), misinterpreted AF (AF interpreted as rhythms other than 
      AF), and true AF (AF interpreted as AF by both computer ECG interpretation and 
      cardiologists). RESULTS: There were 1057 AF-related ECGs from 409 patients. Among 
      these, 840 ECGs (79.5%) were true AF. Overinterpretation occurred in 98 (9.3%) 
      cases. Sinus rhythm and sinus tachycardia with premature atrial contraction and/or 
      baseline artifact and sinus arrhythmia were commonly overinterpreted as AF. Heart 
      rate ≤60 bpm and baseline artifact significantly increased the likelihood of 
      overinterpreted AF. Misdiagnosis occurred in 119 (11.3%) cases, in which AF was 
      usually misdiagnosed as sinus or supraventricular tachycardia. The presence of 
      tachycardia and low-amplitude atrial activity significantly increased the likelihood 
      of misdiagnosis of AF. Among the erroneous computer ECG interpretations, 17 cases 
      (7.8%) were not corrected by the ordering physicians and/or repeat computer-ECG 
      interpretation; inappropriate follow-up studies or treatments of the patients were 
      undertaken with no serious sequelae. CONCLUSIONS: Erroneous computer ECG 
      interpretation of AF was not rare. Attention should be concentrated on educating 
      physicians about ECG appearance and confounding factors of AF, along with ongoing 
      quality control of built-in software for automatic ECG interpretation.

TI  - Appropriate threshold levels of cardiac beat-to-beat variation in semi-automatic 
      analysis of equine ECG recordings.
PG  - 266
LID - 266
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although premature beats are a matter of concern in horses, the 
      interpretation of equine ECG recordings is complicated by a lack of standardized 
      analysis criteria and a limited knowledge of the normal beat-to-beat variation of 
      equine cardiac rhythm. The purpose of this study was to determine the appropriate 
      threshold levels of maximum acceptable deviation of RR intervals in equine ECG 
      analysis, and to evaluate a novel two-step timing algorithm by quantifying the 
      frequency of arrhythmias in a cohort of healthy adult endurance horses. RESULTS: 
      Beat-to-beat variation differed considerably with heart rate (HR), and an adaptable 
      model consisting of three different HR ranges with separate threshold levels of 
      maximum acceptable RR deviation was consequently defined. For resting HRs <60 
      beats/min (bpm) the threshold level of RR deviation was set at 20%, for HRs in the 
      intermediate range between 60 and 100 bpm the threshold was 10%, and for exercising 
      HRs >100 bpm, the threshold level was 4%. Supraventricular premature beats 
      represented the most prevalent arrhythmia category with varying frequencies in seven 
      horses at rest (median 7, range 2-86) and six horses during exercise (median 2, 
      range 1-24). CONCLUSIONS: Beat-to-beat variation of equine cardiac rhythm varies 
      according to HR, and threshold levels in equine ECG analysis should be adjusted 
      accordingly. Standardization of the analysis criteria will enable comparisons of 
      studies and follow-up examinations of patients. A small number of supraventricular 
      premature beats appears to be a normal finding in endurance horses. Further studies 
      are required to validate the findings and determine the clinical significance of 
      premature beats in horses.

AB  - Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the most common cause of heart disease globally. 
      This is because there is no symptom exhibited in its initial phase until the disease 
      progresses to an advanced stage. The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a widely accessible 
      diagnostic tool to diagnose CAD that captures abnormal activity of the heart. 
      However, it lacks diagnostic sensitivity. One reason is that, it is very challenging 
      to visually interpret the ECG signal due to its very low amplitude. Hence, 
      identification of abnormal ECG morphology by clinicians may be prone to error. Thus, 
      it is essential to develop a software which can provide an automated and objective 
      interpretation of the ECG signal. This paper proposes the implementation of long 
      short-term memory (LSTM) network with convolutional neural network (CNN) to 
      automatically diagnose CAD ECG signals accurately. Our proposed deep learning model 
      is able to detect CAD ECG signals with a diagnostic accuracy of 99.85% with 
      blindfold strategy. The developed prototype model is ready to be tested with an 
      appropriate huge database before the clinical usage.

AB  - Sudden cardiac death in young athletes is a devastating event. Screening programs 
      have been proposed to prevent sudden cardiac death in young athletes. Mortality 
      rates and causes of death differ among young adults and children. Children have a 
      considerably lower incidence of sudden cardiac death. Data lack to compare athletes 
      and non-athletes in childhood, but 40-50 % of sudden cardiac death in this age group 
      seems to be related to exercise. Screening programs including history and physical 
      exam are not very sensitive or specific and will result in important numbers of 
      false-positives and false-negatives. Especially, interpretation of ECG in children 
      is different from ECG in adults, with less accurate diagnoses as a consequence. 
      Secondary prevention by widespread education of simple resuscitation techniques and 
      use of automatic external defibrillators if available will probably save as many 
      lives as any screening program. CONCLUSION: Sufficient data are lacking to support 
      general preparticipation screening with history, physical exam, and ECG in 
      competitive children. Nevertheless, the impact of such a program, together with 
      secondary preventive measures, should be evaluated in large prospective studies.

TI  - Vectorcardiographic recordings of the Q-T interval in a pediatric long Q-T syndrome 
      population.

AB  - Measurements of the Q-T interval are less reliable in children than in adults. 
      Identification of superior diagnostic tools is warranted. This study aimed to 
      investigate whether a vectorcardiogram (VCG) recorded from three orthogonal leads 
      (X, Y, Z) according to Frank is superior to a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) in 
      providing a correct long Q-T syndrome (LQTS) diagnosis in children. This LQTS group 
      consisted of 35 genetically confirmed carriers of mutations in the KCNQ1 (n = 29) 
      and KCNH2 (n = 6) genes. The control group consisted of 35 age- and gender-matched 
      healthy children. The mean age was 7 years in the LQTS group and 6.7 years in the 
      control group (range, 0.5-16 years). The corrected Q-T interval (QT(c)) was measured 
      manually (QT(man)) by one author (A.W.). The 12-lead ECG automatic measurements 
      (QT(ECG)) and interpretation (QT(Interpret)) of QT(c) were performed with the 
      Mac5000 (GE Medical System), and the VCG automatic measurements (QT(VCG)) were 
      performed with the Mida1000, CoroNet (Ortivus AB, Sweden). By either method, a QT(c) 
      longer than 440 ms was considered prolonged and indicative of LQTS. Of the 35 
      children with genetically confirmed LQTS, 30 (86 %) received a correct diagnosis 
      using QT(VCG), 29 (82 %) using QT(man), 24 (69 %) using QT(ECG), and 17 (49 %) using 
      QT(Interpret). Specificity was 0.80 for QT(VCG), 0.83 for QT(man), 0.77 for QT(ECG), 
      and 0.83 for QT(Interpret). The VCG automatic measurement of QT(c) seems to be a 
      better predictor of LQTS than automatic measurement and interpretation of 12-lead 
      ECG.

TI  - Automated 3D segmentation and diameter measurement of the thoracic aorta on 
      non-contrast enhanced CT.
PG  - 4613-4623
LID - 10.1007/s00330-018-5931-z [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To develop and evaluate a fully automatic method to measure diameters of 
      the ascending and descending aorta on non-ECG-gated, non-contrast computed 
      tomography (CT) scans. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The method combines multi-atlas 
      registration to obtain seed points, aorta centerline extraction, and an optimal 
      surface segmentation approach to extract the aorta surface around the centerline. 
      From the extracted 3D aorta segmentation, the diameter of the ascending and 
      descending aorta was calculated at cross-sectional slices perpendicular to the 
      extracted centerline, at the level of the pulmonary artery bifurcation, and at 1-cm 
      intervals up to 3 cm above and below this level. Agreement with manual annotations 
      was evaluated by dice similarity coefficient (DSC) for segmentation overlap, mean 
      surface distance (MSD), and intra-class correlation (ICC) of diameters on 100 CT 
      scans from a lung cancer screening trial. Repeatability of the diameter measurements 
      was evaluated on 617 baseline-one year follow-up CT scan pairs. RESULTS: The 
      agreement between manual and automatic segmentations was good with 0.95 ± 0.01 DSC 
      and 0.56 ± 0.08 mm MSD. ICC between the diameters derived from manual and from 
      automatic segmentations was 0.97, with the per-level ICC ranging from 0.87 to 0.94. 
      An ICC of 0.98 for all measurements and per-level ICC ranging from 0.91 to 0.96 were 
      obtained for repeatability. CONCLUSION: This fully automatic method can assess 
      diameters in the thoracic aorta reliably even in non-ECG-gated, non-contrast CT 
      scans. This could be a promising tool to assess aorta dilatation in screening and in 
      clinical practice. KEY POINTS: • Fully automatic method to assess thoracic aorta 
      diameters. • High agreement between fully automatic method and manual segmentations. 
      • Method is suitable for non-ECG-gated CT and can therefore be used in screening.

TI  - Development and validation of an automatic method to detect the latest contracting 
      viable left ventricular segments to assist guide CRT therapy from gated SPECT 
      myocardial perfusion imaging.
PG  - 1948-1957
LID - 10.1007/s12350-017-0853-8 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study is to use ECG-gated SPECT MPI to detect the 
      latest contracting viable left ventricular (LV) segments to help guide the LV probe 
      placement used in CRT therapy and to validate segment selection against the visual 
      integration method by experts. METHODS: For each patient, the resting ECG-gated 
      SPECT MPI short-axis images were sampled in 3D to generate a polar map of the 
      perfusion distribution used to determine LV myocardial viability, and to measure LV 
      synchronicity using our phase analysis tool. In the visual integration method, two 
      experts visually interpreted the LV viability and mechanical dyssynchrony from the 
      short-axis images and polar maps of viability and phase, to determine the latest 
      contracting viable segments using the 17-segment model. In the automatic method, the 
      apical segments, septal segments, and segments with more than 50% scar were excluded 
      as these are not candidates for CRT LV probe placement. Amongst the remaining viable 
      segments, the segments, whose phase angles were within 10° of the latest phase angle 
      (the most delayed contracting segment), were identified for potential CRT LV probe 
      placement and ranked based on the phase angles of the segments. Both methods were 
      tested in 36 pre-CRT patients who underwent ECG-gated SPECT MPI. The accuracy was 
      determined as the percent agreement between the visual integration and automatic 
      methods. The automatic method was performed by a second independent operator to 
      evaluate the inter-operator processing reproducibility. RESULTS: In all the 36 
      patients, the LV lead positions of the 1st choices recommended by the automatic and 
      visual integration methods were in the same segments in 35 patients, which achieved 
      an agreement rate of 97.2%. In the inter-operator reproducibility test, the LV lead 
      positions of the 1st choices recommended by the two operators were in the same 
      segments in 25 patients, and were in the adjacent segments in 7 patients, which 
      achieved an overall agreement of 88.8%. CONCLUSIONS: An automatic method has been 
      developed to detect the latest contracting viable LV segments to help guide the LV 
      probe placement used in CRT therapy. The retrospective clinical study with 36 
      patients suggests that this method has high agreement against the visual integration 
      method by experts and good inter-operator reproducibility. Consequently, this method 
      is promising to be a clinical tool to recommend the CRT LV lead positions.

TI  - Automatic SVM classification of sudden cardiac death and pump failure death from 
      autonomic and repolarization ECG markers.

LID - S0022-0736(15)00109-0 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jelectrocard.2015.04.002 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Considering the rates of sudden cardiac death (SCD) and pump failure 
      death (PFD) in chronic heart failure (CHF) patients and the cost-effectiveness of 
      their preventing treatments, identification of CHF patients at risk is an important 
      challenge. In this work, we studied the prognostic performance of the combination of 
      an index potentially related to dispersion of repolarization restitution (Δα), an 
      index quantifying T-wave alternans (IAA) and the slope of heart rate turbulence (TS) 
      for classification of SCD and PFD. METHODS: Holter ECG recordings of 597 CHF 
      patients with sinus rhythm enrolled in the MUSIC study were analyzed and Δα, IAA and 
      TS were obtained. A strategy was implemented using support vector machines (SVM) to 
      classify patients in three groups: SCD victims, PFD victims and other patients (the 
      latter including survivors and victims of non-cardiac causes). Cross-validation was 
      used to evaluate the performance of the implemented classifier. RESULTS: Δα and IAA, 
      dichotomized at 0.035 (dimensionless) and 3.73 μV, respectively, were the ECG 
      markers most strongly associated with SCD, while TS, dichotomized at 2.5 ms/RR, was 
      the index most strongly related to PFD. When separating SCD victims from the rest of 
      patients, the individual marker with best performance was Δα≥0.035, which, for a 
      fixed specificity (Sp) of 90%, showed a sensitivity (Se) value of 10%, while the 
      combination of Δα and IAA increased Se to 18%. For separation of PFD victims from 
      the rest of patients, the best individual marker was TS ≤ 2.5 ms/RR, which, for 
      Sp=90%, showed a Se of 26%, this value being lower than Se=34%, produced by the 
      combination of Δα and TS. Furthermore, when performing SVM classification into the 
      three reported groups, the optimal combination of risk markers led to a maximum Sp 
      of 79% (Se=18%) for SCD and Sp of 81% (Se=14%) for PFD. CONCLUSIONS: The results 
      shown in this work suggest that it is possible to efficiently discriminate SCD and 
      PFD in a population of CHF patients using ECG-derived risk markers like Δα, TS and 
      IAA.

TI  - Automatic Identification of Reentry Mechanisms and Critical Sites During Atrial 
      Tachycardia by Analyzing Areas of Activity.
PG  - 2334-2344
LID - 10.1109/TBME.2018.2794321 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Atrial tachycardia (AT) still poses a major challenge in catheter 
      ablation. Although state-of-the-art electroanatomical mapping systems allow to 
      acquire several thousand intracardiac electrograms (EGMs), algorithms for diagnostic 
      analysis are mainly limited to the amplitude of the signal (voltage map) and the 
      local activation time (LAT map). We applied spatio-temporal analysis of EGM activity 
      to generate maps indicating reentries and diastolic potentials, thus identifying and 
      localizing the driving mechanism of AT. METHODS: First, the time course of active 
      surface area ASA is determined during one basic cycle length (BCL). The chamber 
      cycle length coverage cCLC reflects the relative duration within one BCL for which 
      activity was present in each individual atrium. A local cycle length coverage lCLC 
      is computed for circular subareas with 20 mm diameter. The simultaneous active 
      surface area sASA is determined to indicate the spatial extent of depolarizing 
      tissue. RESULTS: Combined analysis of these spatial scales allowed to correctly 
      identify and localize the driving mechanism: cCLC values of 100% were indicative for 
      atria harbouring a reentrant driver. lCLC could detect micro reentries within an 
      area of 1.65 $\pm$ 1.28 cm $^2$ in simulated data and differentiate them against 
      focal sources. Middiastolic potentials, being potential targets for catheter 
      ablation, were identified as areas showing confined activity based on sASA values. 
      CONCLUSION: The concept of spatio-temporal activity analysis proved successful and 
      correctly indicated the tachycardia mechanism in 20 simulated AT scenarios and three 
      clinical data sets. SIGNIFICANCE: Automatic interpretation of intracardiac mapping 
      data could help to improve the treatment strategy in complex cases of AT.

TI  - Abductive reasoning as a basis to reproduce expert criteria in ECG atrial 
      fibrillation identification.
PG  - 084006
LID - 10.1088/1361-6579/aad7e4 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This work aims at providing a new method for the automatic detection of 
      atrial fibrillation, other arrhythmia and noise on short single-lead ECG signals, 
      emphasizing the importance of the interpretability of the classification results. 
      APPROACH: A morphological and rhythm description of the cardiac behavior is obtained 
      by a knowledge-based interpretation of the signal using the Construe abductive 
      framework. Then, a set of meaningful features are extracted for each individual 
      heartbeat and as a summary of the full record. The feature distributions can be used 
      to elucidate the expert criteria underlying the labeling of the 2017 PhysioNet/CinC 
      Challenge dataset, enabling a manual partial relabeling to improve the consistency 
      of the training set. Finally, a tree gradient boosting model and a recurrent neural 
      network are combined using the stacking technique to provide an answer on the basis 
      of the feature values. MAIN RESULTS: The proposal was independently validated 
      against the hidden dataset of the Challenge, achieving a combined F (1) score of 
      0.83 and tying for the first place in the official stage of the Challenge. This 
      result was even improved in the follow-up stage to 0.85 with a significant 
      simplification of the model, attaining the highest score so far reported on the 
      hidden dataset. SIGNIFICANCE: The obtained results demonstrate the potential of 
      Construe to provide robust and valuable descriptions of temporal data, even with the 
      presence of significant amounts of noise. Furthermore, the importance of consistent 
      classification criteria in manually labeled training datasets is emphasized, and the 
      fundamental advantages of knowledge-based approaches to formalize and validate those 
      criteria are discussed.

TI  - Ensembling convolutional and long short-term memory networks for electrocardiogram 
      arrhythmia detection.
PG  - 114002
LID - 10.1088/1361-6579/aad386 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Atrial fibrillation is a common type of heart rhythm abnormality caused 
      by a problem with the heart's electrical system. Early detection of this disease has 
      important implications for stroke prevention and management. Our objective is to 
      construct an intelligent tool that assists cardiologists in identifying 
      automatically cardiac arrhythmias and noise in electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings. 
      APPROACH: Our base deep classifier combined a convolutional neural network (CNNs) 
      and a sequence of long short-term memory units, with pooling, dropout and 
      normalization techniques to improve their accuracy. The network predicted a 
      classification at every 18th input sample and the final prediction was selected for 
      classification. Ten standalone models that used our base classifier architecture 
      were first cross-validated separately on 90% of the PhysioNet/CinC Challenge 2017 
      dataset and then tested on 10%. An ensemble classifier selected the label of the 
      best average probability from the ten sub-models to improve prediction quality. MAIN 
      RESULTS: Our original result submitted to the challenge gave a mean F(1)-measure of 
      80%. The new proposed method improved the test score to 82%, which was tied for the 
      third-highest score in the follow-up phase of the challenge. SIGNIFICANCE: Without 
      employing a time-consuming feature engineering step, the ensemble classifier trained 
      with this architecture provided a robust solution to the problem of detecting 
      cardiac arrhythmia from noisy ECG signals. In addition, interpretation of the 
      classifier by inspection of its network parameters and predictions revealed what 
      aspects of the ECG signal the classifier considered most discriminating.

LID - 154
AB  - Electrocardiography (ECG) is a key non-invasive diagnostic tool for cardiovascular 
      diseases which is increasingly supported by algorithms based on machine learning. 
      Major obstacles for the development of automatic ECG interpretation algorithms are 
      both the lack of public datasets and well-defined benchmarking procedures to allow 
      comparison s of different algorithms. To address these issues, we put forward 
      PTB-XL, the to-date largest freely accessible clinical 12-lead ECG-waveform dataset 
      comprising 21837 records from 18885 patients of 10 seconds length. The ECG-waveform 
      data was annotated by up to two cardiologists as a multi-label dataset, where 
      diagnostic labels were further aggregated into super and subclasses. The dataset 
      covers a broad range of diagnostic classes including, in particular, a large 
      fraction of healthy records. The combination with additional metadata on 
      demographics, additional diagnostic statements, diagnosis likelihoods, manually 
      annotated signal properties as well as suggested folds for splitting training and 
      test sets turns the dataset into a rich resource for the development and the 
      evaluation of automatic ECG interpretation algorithms.

TI  - A Fiducial Scaffold for ECG Compression in Low-Powered Devices.
PG  - 1-4
LID - 10.1109/EMBC.2018.8512968 [doi]
AB  - Large volumes of physiological data can now be routinely collected using wearable 
      devices, though a key challenge that remains is the conversion of raw data into 
      clinically relevant and actionable information. While power constraints prevent 
      continuous wireless streaming of large amounts of raw data for offline processing, 
      on-board microprocessors have become sufficiently powerful for data reduction to be 
      performed in real time on the wearable device itself, so that only aggregate, 
      clinically interpretable measures need to be transmitted wirelessly. Here, we use 
      the curve-length transform to extract key beat-by-beat information from the raw ECG 
      waveform, and to identify clinically relevant timing and amplitude information. Each 
      beat is parameterized by 12 morphological features that serve as fiducial markers, 
      sufficient to directly reconstruct a scaffold representation of the ECG waveform. At 
      a nominal heart rate of 70 beats/min and a sampling rate of 250 Hz, typical for 
      wearable monitors, this represents approximately an 18-fold compression. Using 
      difference encoding, the compression ratio improves to 21. Our algorithm computes a 
      running exponentially-weighted average of each identified morphological feature. 
      When any feature deviates significantly from its running average, the algorithm 
      retains the raw waveform for five beats preceding and following the anomaly, 
      enabling future review of the raw data. The algorithm automatically located 93.8% of 
      the 3,615 expert-annotated QRS onsets and offsets in the PhysioNet QT-Database to 
      within 20 ms. Similarly, it located 83.5% of all 3,194 P-wave onset and offset 
      annotations to within 32 ms, and 89.0% of all 3,542 T-wave offset annotations within 
      72 ms.

TI  - Intelligent classification of heartbeats for automated real-time ECG monitoring.
PG  - 1069-77
LID - 10.1089/tmj.2014.0033 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The automatic interpretation of electrocardiography (ECG) data can 
      provide continuous analysis of heart activity, allowing the effective use of 
      wireless devices such as the Holter monitor. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We propose an 
      intelligent heartbeat monitoring system to detect the possibility of arrhythmia in 
      real time. We detected heartbeats and extracted features such as the QRS complex and 
      P wave from ECG signals using the Pan-Tompkins algorithm, and the heartbeats were 
      then classified into 16 types using a decision tree. RESULTS: We tested the 
      sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of our system against data from the MIT-BIH 
      Arrhythmia Database. Our system achieved an average accuracy of 97% in heartbeat 
      detection and an average heartbeat classification accuracy of above 96%, which is 
      comparable with the best competing schemes. CONCLUSIONS: This work provides a guide 
      to the systematic design of an intelligent classification system for decision 
      support in Holter ECG monitoring.

AB  - Classifying arrhythmias can be a tough task for a human being and automating this 
      task is highly desirable. Nevertheless fully automatic arrhythmia classification 
      through Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals is a challenging task when the inter-patient 
      paradigm is considered. For the inter-patient paradigm, classifiers are evaluated on 
      signals of unknown subjects, resembling the real world scenario. In this work, we 
      explore a novel ECG representation based on vectorcardiogram (VCG), called temporal 
      vectorcardiogram (TVCG), along with a complex network for feature extraction. We 
      also fine-tune the SVM classifier and perform feature selection with a particle 
      swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. Results for the inter-patient paradigm show that 
      the proposed method achieves the results comparable to state-of-the-art in MIT-BIH 
      database (53% of Positive predictive (+P) for the Supraventricular ectopic beat (S) 
      class and 87.3% of Sensitivity (Se) for the Ventricular ectopic beat (V) class) that 
      TVCG is a richer representation of the heartbeat and that it could be useful for 
      problems involving the cardiac signal and pattern recognition.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The accurate differentiation of wide complex tachycardias (WCTs) into 
      ventricular tachycardia (VT) or supraventricular wide complex tachycardia (SWCT) 
      remains problematic despite numerous manually-operated electrocardiogram (ECG) 
      interpretation methods. We sought to create a new WCT differentiation method that 
      could be automatically implemented by computerized ECG interpretation (CEI) 
      software. METHODS: In a two-part study, we developed and validated a logistic 
      regression model (i.e. WCT Formula) that utilizes computerized measurements and 
      computations derived from patients' paired WCT and subsequent baseline ECGs. In Part 
      1, a derivation cohort of paired WCT and baseline ECGs was examined to identify 
      independent VT predictors to be incorporated into the WCT Formula. In Part 2, a 
      separate validation cohort of paired WCT and baseline ECGs was used to prospectively 
      evaluate the WCT Formula's diagnostic performance. RESULTS: The derivation cohort 
      was comprised of 317 paired WCT (157 VT, 160 SWCT) and baseline ECGs. A logistic 
      regression model (i.e. WCT Formula) incorporating WCT QRS duration (ms) (p < 0.001), 
      frontal percent amplitude change (%) (p < 0.001), and horizontal percent amplitude 
      change (%) (p < 0.001) yielded effective WCT differentiation (AUC of 0.96). The 
      validation cohort consisted of 284 paired WCT (116 VT, 168 SWCT) and baseline ECGs. 
      The WCT Formula achieved favorable accuracy (91.5%) with strong sensitivity (89.7%) 
      and specificity (92.9%) for VT. CONCLUSION: The WCT Formula is an example of how 
      contemporary CEI software could be used to successfully differentiate WCTs. The 
      incorporation of similar automated methods into CEI software may improve clinicians' 
      ability to accurately distinguish VT and SWCT.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Pauses in chest compressions (CCs) have a negative association with 
      survival from cardiac arrest. Electrocardiographic (ECG) rhythm analysis and 
      defibrillator charging are significant contributors to CC pauses. OBJECTIVE: 
      Accuracy of the Analysis During Compressions with Fast Reconfirmation (ADC-FR) 
      algorithm, which features automated rhythm analysis and charging during CCs to 
      reduce CC pauses, was retrospectively determined in a large database of ECGs from 
      2701 patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. METHODS: The ADC-FR algorithm 
      generated a total of 7264 advisories, of which 3575 were randomly assigned to a 
      development data set and 3689 to a test data set. With ADC-FR, a high-pass digital 
      filter is used to remove CC artifacts, while the underlying ECG rhythm is 
      automatically interpreted. When CCs are paused at the end of the 2-minute 
      cardiopulmonary resuscitation interval, a 3-second reconfirmation analysis is 
      performed using the artifact-free ECG to confirm the shock/no-shock advisory. The 
      sensitivity and specificity of the ADC-FR algorithm in correctly identifying 
      shockable/nonshockable rhythms during CCs were calculated. RESULTS: In both data 
      sets, the accuracy of the ADC-FR algorithm for each ECG rhythm exceeded the 
      recommended performance goals, which apply to a standard artifact-free ECG analysis. 
      Sensitivity and specificity were 97% and 99%, respectively, for the development data 
      set and 95% and 99% for the test data set. CONCLUSION: The ADC-FR algorithm is 
      highly accurate in discriminating shockable and nonshockable rhythms and can be used 
      to reduce CC pauses.

TI  - Deep learning models for electrocardiograms are susceptible to adversarial attack.
PG  - 360-363
LID - 10.1038/s41591-020-0791-x [doi]
AB  - Electrocardiogram (ECG) acquisition is increasingly widespread in medical and 
      commercial devices, necessitating the development of automated interpretation 
      strategies. Recently, deep neural networks have been used to automatically analyze 
      ECG tracings and outperform physicians in detecting certain rhythm 
      irregularities(1). However, deep learning classifiers are susceptible to adversarial 
      examples, which are created from raw data to fool the classifier such that it 
      assigns the example to the wrong class, but which are undetectable to the human 
      eye(2,3). Adversarial examples have also been created for medical-related 
      tasks(4,5). However, traditional attack methods to create adversarial examples do 
      not extend directly to ECG signals, as such methods introduce square-wave artefacts 
      that are not physiologically plausible. Here we develop a method to construct 
      smoothed adversarial examples for ECG tracings that are invisible to human expert 
      evaluation and show that a deep learning model for arrhythmia detection from 
      single-lead ECG(6) is vulnerable to this type of attack. Moreover, we provide a 
      general technique for collating and perturbing known adversarial examples to create 
      multiple new ones. The susceptibility of deep learning ECG algorithms to adversarial 
      misclassification implies that care should be taken when evaluating these models on 
      ECGs that may have been altered, particularly when incentives for causing 
      misclassification exist.

TI  - A Globally Generalized Emotion Recognition System Involving Different Physiological 
      Signals.
LID - 10.3390/s18061905 [doi]
LID - 1905
AB  - Machine learning approaches for human emotion recognition have recently demonstrated 
      high performance. However, only/mostly for subject-dependent approaches, in a 
      variety of applications like advanced driver assisted systems, smart homes and 
      medical environments. Therefore, now the focus is shifted more towards 
      subject-independent approaches, which are more universal and where the emotion 
      recognition system is trained using a specific group of subjects and then tested on 
      totally new persons and thereby possibly while using other sensors of same 
      physiological signals in order to recognize their emotions. In this paper, we 
      explore a novel robust subject-independent human emotion recognition system, which 
      consists of two major models. The first one is an automatic feature calibration 
      model and the second one is a classification model based on Cellular Neural Networks 
      (CNN). The proposed system produces state-of-the-art results with an accuracy rate 
      between 80% and 89% when using the same elicitation materials and physiological 
      sensors brands for both training and testing and an accuracy rate of 71.05% when the 
      elicitation materials and physiological sensors brands used in training are 
      different from those used in training. Here, the following physiological signals are 
      involved: ECG (Electrocardiogram), EDA (Electrodermal activity) and ST 
      (Skin-Temperature).

AB  - T-wave amplitude (TWA) has been proposed as a marker of the innervation of the 
      myocardium. Until now, TWA has been calculated manually or with poor algorithms, 
      thus making its use not efficient in a clinical environment. We introduce a new 
      wavelet-based algorithm for the delineation QRS complexes and T-waves, and the 
      automatic calculation of TWA. When validated in the MIT/BIH Arrhythmia database, the 
      QRS detector achieved sensitivity and positive predictive value of 99.84% and 
      99.87%, respectively. The algorithm was validated also on the QT database and it 
      achieved sensitivity of 99.50% for T-peak detection. In addition, the algorithm 
      achieved delineation accuracy that is similar to the differences in delineation 
      between expert cardiologists. We applied the algorithm for the evaluation of the 
      influence in TWA of anticholinergic and antiadrenergic drugs (i.e., atropine and 
      metoprolol) for healthy subjects. We found that the TWA decreased significantly with 
      atropine and that metoprolol caused a significant increase in TWA, thus confirming 
      the clinical hypothesis that the TWA is a marker of the innervation of the 
      myocardium. The results of this paper show that the proposed algorithm can be used 
      as a useful and efficient tool in clinical practice for the automatic calculation of 
      TWA and its interpretation as a non-invasive marker of the autonomic ventricular 
      innervation.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Atrial Fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia, 
      presenting a significant independent risk factor for stroke and thromboembolism. 
      With the emergence of m-Health devices, the importance of automatic detection of AF 
      in an off-clinic setting is growing. This study demonstrates the performance of a 
      bimodal classifier for distinguishing AF from sinus rhythm (SR) that could be used 
      for automated detection of AF episodes. METHODS: Surface recordings from a hand-held 
      research device and standard electrocardiograms (ECG) were collected and analyzed 
      from 68 subjects. An additional 48 subjects from the MIT-BIH Arrythmia Database were 
      also analyzed. All ECGs were blindly reviewed by physicians independently of the 
      bimodal algorithm analysis. The algorithm selects an artifact-free 6-s ECG segment 
      out of a 20-s long recording and computes a spectral Frequency Dispersion Metric 
      (FDM) and a temporal R-R interval variability (VRR) index. RESULTS: Scatter plots of 
      the VRR and FDM indices revealed two distinct clusters. The bimodal scattering of 
      the indices revealed a linear classification boundary that could be employed to 
      differentiate the SR from AF waveforms. The selected classification boundary was 
      able to correctly differentiate all the subjects from both datasets into either SR 
      or AF groups, except for 3 SR subjects from the MIT-BIH dataset. CONCLUSION: Our 
      bimodal classification algorithm was demonstrated to successfully acquire, analyze 
      and interpret ECGs for the presence of AF indicating its potential to support 
      m-Health diagnosis, monitoring, and management of therapy in AF patients.

LID - 10.1186/1475-925X-11-16 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vectorcardiogram (VCG) signals monitor both spatial and temporal cardiac 
      electrical activities along three orthogonal planes of the body. However, the 
      absence of spatiotemporal resolution in conventional VCG representations is a major 
      impediment for medical interpretation and clinical usage of VCG. This is especially 
      so because time-domain features of 12-lead ECG, instead of both spatial and temporal 
      characteristics of VCG, are widely used for the automatic assessment of cardiac 
      pathological patterns. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We present a novel representation 
      approach that captures critical spatiotemporal heart dynamics by displaying the real 
      time motion of VCG cardiac vectors in a 3D space. Such a dynamic display can also be 
      realized with only one lead ECG signal (e.g., ambulatory ECG) through an alternative 
      lag-reconstructed ECG representation from nonlinear dynamics principles. 
      Furthermore, the trajectories are color coded with additional dynamical properties 
      of space-time VCG signals, e.g., the curvature, speed, octant and phase angles to 
      enhance the information visibility. RESULTS: In this investigation, spatiotemporal 
      VCG signal representation is used to characterize various spatiotemporal 
      pathological patterns for healthy control (HC), myocardial infarction (MI), atrial 
      fibrillation (AF) and bundle branch block (BBB). The proposed color coding scheme 
      revealed that the spatial locations of the peak of T waves are in the Octant 6 for 
      the majority (i.e., 74 out of 80) of healthy recordings in the PhysioNet PTB 
      database. In contrast, the peak of T waves from 31.79% (117/368) of MI subjects are 
      found to remain in Octant 6 and the rest (68.21%) spread over all other octants. The 
      spatiotemporal VCG signal representation is shown to capture the same important 
      heart characteristics as the 12-lead ECG plots and more. CONCLUSIONS: Spatiotemporal 
      VCG signal representation is shown to facilitate the characterization of space-time 
      cardiac pathological patterns and enhance the automatic assessment of cardiovascular 
      diseases.

TI  - Ventricular fibrillation recorded and analysed within an area the size of a mobile 
      phone: could it enable cardiac arrest recognition?
PG  - 394-399
LID - 10.1097/MEJ.0000000000000473 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recognition of out-of-hospital-cardiac arrests (OHCAs) at emergency 
      medical communication centres is based on questions of OHCA symptoms, resulting in 
      50-80% accuracy rates. However, OHCAs might be recognized more promptly using 
      'rhythm-based' recognition, whereby a victim's cardiac rhythm is recorded with 
      mobile phone technology that analyses and transmits recordings to emergency medical 
      communication centres for further interpretation. OBJECTIVE: To examine whether the 
      quality of normal cardiac rhythm and the rhythm with the best prognosis in OHCA, 
      ventricular fibrillation (VF), is sufficient for 'rhythm-based' OHCA recognition 
      when recorded within a mobile phone-sized device. PATIENTS AND METHODS: mid-sternum 
      within an area the size of a mobile phone and analysed by automated external 
      defibrillator (AED) software and two cardiologists. The rhythms were categorized as 
      shockable or nonshockable. The cardiologists assessed the quality of the recordings. 
      RESULTS: The AED software correctly analysed all normal rhythms and 15 of 22 VF 
      rhythms. The VF duration was too short for automatic detection in seven cases. The 
      cardiologists analysed all the normal rhythms and VF sequences correctly and graded 
      them as high quality. CONCLUSION: The recordings of normal ECG rhythm and VF within 
      an area the size of a mobile phone are of sufficient quality and could be used in 
      'rhythm-based' OHCA recognition. The VF period was too short for an accurate 
      analysis by the AED software in some cases.

TI  - CT evaluation prior to transapical aortic valve replacement: semi-automatic versus 
      manual image segmentation.
PG  - 1233-42
LID - 10.1007/s10554-015-0662-6 [doi]
AB  - To compare the performance of semi-automatic versus manual segmentation for 
      ECG-triggered cardiovascular computed tomography (CT) examinations prior to 
      transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), with focus on the speed and precision 
      of experienced versus inexperienced observers. The preoperative ECG-triggered CT 
      data of 30 consecutive patients who were scheduled for TAVR were included. All 
      datasets were separately evaluated by two radiologists with 1 and 5 years of 
      experience (novice and expert, respectively) in cardiovascular CT using an 
      evaluation software program with or without a semi-automatic TAVR workflow. The time 
      expended for data loading and all segmentation steps required for the implantation 
      planning were assessed. Inter-software as well as inter-observer reliability 
      analysis was performed. The CT datasets were successfully evaluated, with mean 
      duration between 520.4 ± 117.6 s and 693.2 ± 159.5 s. The three most time-consuming 
      steps were the 3D volume rendering, the measurement of aorta diameter and the sizing 
      of the aortic annulus. Using semi-automatic segmentation, a novice could evaluate CT 
      data approximately 12.3% faster than with manual segmentation, and an expert could 
      evaluate CT data approximately 10.3% faster [mean differences of 85.4 ± 83.8 s (p < 
      0.001) and 59.8 ± 101 s (p < 0.001), respectively]. The inter-software reliability 
      for a novice was slightly lower than for an expert; however, the reliability for a 
      novice and expert was excellent (ICC 0.92, 95% CI 0.75-0.97/ICC 0.96, 95% CI 
      0.91-0.98). Automatic aortic annulus detection failed in two patients (6.7%). The 
      study revealed excellent inter-software and inter-observer reliability, with a mean 
      ICC of 0.95. TAVR evaluation can be accomplished significantly faster with 
      semi-automatic rather than with manual segmentation, with comparable exactness, 
      showing a benefit for experienced and inexperienced observers.

TI  - Electrocardiographic diagnosis of atrial tachycardia: classification, P-wave 
      morphology, and differential diagnosis with other supraventricular tachycardias.
PG  - 314-27
LID - 10.1111/anec.12246 [doi]
AB  - Atrial tachycardia is defined as a regular atrial activation from atrial areas with 
      centrifugal spread, caused by enhanced automaticity, triggered activity or 
      microreentry. New ECG classification differentiates between focal and macroreentrant 
      atrial tachycardia. Macroreentrant atrial tachycardias include typical atrial 
      flutter and other well characterized macroreentrant circuits in right and left 
      atrium. Typical atrial flutter has been described as counterclockwise reentry within 
      right atrial and it presents a characteristic ECG "sawtooth" pattern on the inferior 
      leads. The foci responsible for focal atrial tachycardia do not occur randomly 
      throughout the atria but tend to cluster at characteristic anatomical locations. The 
      surface ECG is a very helpful tool in directing mapping to particular areas of 
      interest. Atrial tachycardia should be differentiated from other supraventricular 
      tachycardias. We propose a diagnostic algorithm in order to help the physician to 
      discriminate among those. Holter analysis could offer further details to 
      differentiate between atrial tachycardia and another supraventricular tachycardia. 
      However, if the diagnosis is uncertain, it is possible to utilize vagal maneuvers or 
      adenosine administration. In conclusion, in spite of well-known limits, a good 
      interpretation of ECG is very important and it could help the physician to manage 
      and to treat correctly patients with atrial tachycardia.

AB  - BACKGROUND: ECG-gated SPECT myocardial perfusion imaging is usually acquired in 
      supine position. However, some patients are not comfortable in this position for a 
      variety of personal or medical reasons. Our aim was to investigate the effect of 
      patient positioning on quantitative SPECT imaging results using normal supine 
      database. METHODS: 55 patients (mean age 58.5 ± 8.3 years) were enrolled in this 
      prospective study. Each patient had a pair of ECG-gated stress SPECT myocardial 
      perfusion images acquired on two gamma cameras: one in supine position and the other 
      in upright sitting position. Left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF), 
      end-diastolic (ED), and end-systolic (ES) left ventricular volumes (V), LV mass, 
      summed stress perfusion defect score (SSS), and total severity score (TSS) were 
      calculated automatically relative to a supine normal reference database. RESULTS: 
      There were no significant differences in LVEF using the two cameras (0.65 ± 0.08 vs. 
      0.66 ± 0.10; P > 0.1). However, EDV, ESV, and LV mass were significantly smaller in 
      sitting position than in supine position (89 vs. 80 ml; 33 vs. 29 ml and 115 vs. 
      109 ml, respectively, all P < 0.0001). On the other hand, SSS and TSS were 
      significantly higher in sitting position than in supine position (5.16 vs. 8.73 and 
      166.82 vs. 288.27, both P < 0.0001). Overall, more studies in sitting position were 
      interpreted as abnormal than in supine position (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Patient 
      positioning has a significant impact on quantitative gated SPECT imaging results. 
      Using a supine normal reference database, SSS and TSS were larger in sitting 
      position than in supine position. Thus, for imaging in sitting position, separate 
      normal limits are required.

TI  - Geometric patterns of time-delay plots from different cardiac rhythms and 
      arrhythmias using short-term EKG signals.
PG  - 856-863
LID - 10.1111/cpf.12494 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To date, no systematic work has been intended to describe spatio-temporal 
      patterns of cardiac rhythms using only short series of RR intervals, to facilitate 
      visual or computerized-aided identification of EKG motifs for use in clinical 
      practice. The aim of this study was to detect and classify eye-catching geometric 
      patterns of Poincaré time-delay plots from different types of cardiac rhythms and 
      arrhythmias using short-term EKG signals. METHODS: Approximately 150-300 
      representative, consecutive beats were retrieved from 24-h Holter registers of 100 
      patients with different heart rhythms. Two-dimensional Poincaré charts were created, 
      and the resulting geometric patterns were transformed into representative familiar 
      eye-catching drawings to interpret different arrhythmias. RESULTS: Poincaré plot 
      representation of RR interval data revealed a wide variety of visual patterns: (i) 
      comet-shaped for sinus rhythm; (ii) torpedo-shaped for sinus bradycardia; (iii) 
      cigarette-shaped for sinus tachycardia; (iv) butterfly-shaped for sinus tachycardia 
      and isolated atrial premature complexes; (v) arrow-shaped for isolated premature 
      complexes and inappropriate sinus tachycardia; (vi) inverted fan-shaped for sinus 
      rhythm with frequent atrial premature complexes; (vii) tornado-shaped for atrial 
      flutter and atrial tachycardia; and (viii) fan-shaped for atrial fibrillation. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Modified Poincaré plots with smoothed lines connecting successive 
      points could accurately classify different types of arrhythmias based on short RR 
      interval sequence variability. Characteristic emergent patterns can be visually 
      identified and eventually could be distinguished by an automatic classification 
      system able to discern between arrhythmias. This work provides an alternative method 
      to interpret time-delay plots obtained from short-term EKG signal recordings.

TI  - An automatic classifier of emotions built from entropy of noise.
PG  - 620-627
LID - 10.1111/psyp.12808 [doi]
AB  - The electrocardiogram (ECG) signal has been widely used to study the physiological 
      substrates of emotion. However, searching for better filtering techniques in order 
      to obtain a signal with better quality and with the maximum relevant information 
      remains an important issue for researchers in this field. Signal processing is 
      largely performed for ECG analysis and interpretation, but this process can be 
      susceptible to error in the delineation phase. In addition, it can lead to the loss 
      of important information that is usually considered as noise and, consequently, 
      discarded from the analysis. The goal of this study was to evaluate if the ECG noise 
      allows for the classification of emotions, while using its entropy as an input in a 
      decision tree classifier. We collected the ECG signal from 25 healthy participants 
      while they were presented with videos eliciting negative (fear and disgust) and 
      neutral emotions. The results indicated that the neutral condition showed a perfect 
      identification (100%), whereas the classification of negative emotions indicated 
      good identification performances (60% of sensitivity and 80% of specificity). These 
      results suggest that the entropy of noise contains relevant information that can be 
      useful to improve the analysis of the physiological correlates of emotion.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The first-order high-pass filter (AC coupling) has 
      previously been shown to affect the ECG for higher cut-off frequencies. We seek to 
      find a systematic deviation in computer measurements of the electrocardiogram when 
      the AC coupling with a 0.05 Hz first-order high-pass filter is used. METHODS: The 
      standard 12-lead electrocardiogram from 1248 patients and the automated measurements 
      of their DC and AC coupled version were used. We expect a large unipolar QRS-complex 
      to produce a deviation in the opposite direction in the ST-segment. RESULTS: We 
      found a strong correlation between the QRS integral and the offset throughout the 
      ST-segment. The coefficient for J amplitude deviation was found to be 
      -0.277 µV/(µV⋅s). CONCLUSIONS: Potential dangerous alterations to the diagnostically 
      important ST-segment were found. Medical professionals and software developers for 
      electrocardiogram interpretation programs should be aware of such high-pass filter 
      effects since they could be misinterpreted as pathophysiology or some 
      pathophysiology could be masked by these effects.

TI  - ECG artefact identification and removal in mHealth systems for continuous patient 
      monitoring.
PG  - 171-176
AB  - Continuous patient monitoring systems acquire enormous amounts of data that is 
      either manually analysed by doctors or automatically processed using intelligent 
      algorithms. Sections of data acquired over long period of time can be corrupted with 
      artefacts due to patient movement, sensor placement and interference from other 
      sources. Owing to the large volume of data these artefacts need to be automatically 
      identified so that the analysis systems and doctors are aware of them while making 
      medical diagnosis. Three important factors are explored that must be considered and 
      quantified for the design and evaluation of automatic artefact identification 
      algorithms: signal quality, interpretation quality and computational complexity. The 
      first two are useful to determine the effectiveness of an algorithm, whereas the 
      third is particularly vital in mHealth systems where computational resources are 
      heavily constrained. A series of artefact identification and filtering algorithms 
      are then presented focusing on the electrocardiography data. These algorithms are 
      quantified using the three metrics to demonstrate how different algorithms can be 
      evaluated and compared to select the best ones for a given wireless sensor network.

      systemic vascular resistance.
PG  - 57-60

AB  - Discovering information encoded in non-invasively recorded biosignals which belies 
      an individual's well-being can help facilitate the development of low-cost 
      unobtrusive medical device technologies, or enable the unsupervised performance of 
      physiological assessments without excessive oversight from trained clinical 
      personnel. Although the unobtrusive or unsupervised nature of such technologies 
      often results in less accurate measures than their invasive or supervised 
      counterparts, this disadvantage is typically outweighed by the ability to monitor 
      larger populations than ever before. The expected consequential benefit will be an 
      improvement in healthcare provision and health outcomes for all. The process of 
      discovering indicators of health in unsupervised or unobtrusive biosignal 
      recordings, or automatically ensuring the validity and quality of such signals, is 
      best realized when following a proven systematic methodology. This paper provides a 
      brief tutorial review of supervised learning, which is a sub-discipline of machine 
      learning, and discusses its application in the development of algorithms to 
      interpret biosignals acquired in unsupervised or semi-supervised environments, with 
      the aim of estimating well-being. Some specific examples in the disparate 
      application areas of telehealth electrocardiogram recording and calculating 
      post-operative systemic vascular resistance are discussed in the context of this 
      systematic approach for information discovery.

TI  - Feasibility of a Single Contrast Bolus High-Pitch Pulmonary CT Angiography Protocol 
      Followed by Low-Dose Retrospectively ECG-Gated Cardiac CT in Patients with Suspected 
      Pulmonary Embolism.
PG  - 542-550
LID - 10.1055/s-0044-100725 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION:  To prospectively evaluate the feasibility of single contrast bolus 
      high-pitch CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) subsequently followed by low-dose 
      retrospectively ECG-gated cardiac CT (4D-cCT) in patients with suspected pulmonary 
      embolism (PE) to accurately evaluate right ventricular (RV) function. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS:  62 patients (33 female, age 65.1 ± 17.5 years) underwent high-pitch CTPA 
      examination with 80cc of iodinated contrast material. 5 s after the end of the 
      high-pitch CTPA study, a low-dose retrospectively ECG-gated cardiac CT examination 
      was automatically started. The volume CT dose index (CTDI vol) and dose length 
      product (DLP) were recorded in all patients and the effective dose was calculated. 
      For the assessment of image quality, attenuation was measured as Hounsfield units 
      (HUs) within various regions of interest (ROIs). These ROIs were used to calculate 
      the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR). Subjective image 
      quality was assessed using a five-point Likert scale. On 4D-cCT, the ejection 
      fraction of both ventricles (RVEF, LVEF) as well as the ratio of RVEF and LVEF 
      (RVEF/LVEF) was assessed. The statistical difference of all parameters between the 
      PE and non-PE group was calculated. RESULTS:  The mean effective radiation dose was 
      4.22 ± 2.05 mSv. Attenuation measurements on CTPA showed the highest attenuation 
      values in the main pulmonary artery (442.01 ± 187.64). On 4D-cCT attenuation values 
      were highest in the descending aorta (560.59 ± 208.81). The CNR and SNR values on 
      CTPA were highest within the main pulmonary artery (CNR = 12.43 ± 4.57; 
      SNR = 15.14 ± 4.90). On 4D-cCT images, the highest SNR and CNR could be measured in 
      the descending aorta (CNR = 10.26 ± 5.57; SNR = 10.86 ± 5.17). The mean LVEF was 
      60.73 %± 14.65 %, and the mean RVEF was 44.90 %± 9.54 %. The mean RVEF/LVEF was 
      0.79 ± 0.29. There was no significant difference between the PE and non-PE group for 
      either of the parameters. CONCLUSION:  The investigated combined CTPA and 4D-cCT 
      protocol is feasible using a single contrast bolus and allows the evaluation of RV 
      function in patients with suspected PE. Further studies have to evaluate the 
      additional value of this protocol regarding risk stratification in patients with PE. 
      KEY POINTS:   · High-pitch CTPA is fast enough to leave sufficient contrast material 
      within the heart that can be used for an additional low-dose functional cardiac CT 
      examination.. · The tube current of the evaluated 4D-cCT is reduced over the entire 
      cardiac cycle without any full dose peak.. · Low-dose cardiac CT subsequently 
      performed after high-pitch CTPA allows for detailed analysis of RV function..

AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of coronary computed tomography (CT) angiography in children 
      with coronary artery anomalies is increasing. However, it remains technically 
      demanding and the need to adapt acquisition parameters to a patient's cardiac 
      characteristics has not yet been addressed. The aim of the study was to 
      prospectively assess the feasibility of personalized multiphasic coronary CT 
      angiography for pediatric patients. METHODS: Fifty pediatric patients (mean age 
      6.1±4.9 years) with coronary artery anomalies underwent a coronary CT angiography on 
      a wide detector single-source CT equipment. Fifteen different acquisition patterns 
      were used to trigger the acquisition at the best theoretical moment within the 
      cardiac cycle. The appropriate pattern was automatically selected based on the 
      patient's heart rate and heart rate variability, derived from the patient's ECG. Two 
      independent radiologists qualitatively evaluated images. RESULTS: All acquisitions 
      fully answered the clinical question for a mean effective dose of 0.97±0.34 mSv. 
      Image quality qualified as good or excellent in 94% of cases (47/50). No examination 
      was considered as not assessable but 6% (3/50) were scored as adequate for 
      diagnosis. For these 3 patients, motion artifacts were the main cause of average 
      image quality. No significant visual differences were reported between the different 
      coronary arteries (mean score of 3.6 on a 4-point scale). No correlation between 
      image quality and cardiac parameters were reported ( r=-0.19 and r=0.00, 
      respectively for heart rate and heart rate variability). CONCLUSIONS: Personalized 
      multiphasic coronary CT angiography acquisitions could be performed with diagnostic 
      quality for a dose equivalent of <4 months of natural background irradiation.

TI  - Statistical evaluation of reproducibility of automated ECG measurements: an example 
      from arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia/cardiomyopathy clinic.
PG  - 23-30
AB  - BACKGROUND: Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia/cardiomyopathy (ARVD/C) is 
      characterized by delay in depolarization of the right ventricle, detected by 
      prolonged terminal activation duration (TAD) in V1-V3. However, manual ECG 
      measurements have shown moderate-to-low intra- and inter-reader agreement. The goal 
      of this study was to assess reproducibility of automated ECG measurements in the 
      right precordial leads. METHODS: Pairs of ECGs recorded in the same day from Johns 
      Hopkins ARVD/C Registry participants [n=247, mean age 35.2±15.6 y, 58% men, 92% 
      whites, 11(4.5%) with definite ARVD/C] were retrospectively analyzed. QRS duration, 
      intrinsicoid deflection, TAD, and T-wave amplitude in the right precordial leads, as 
      well as averaged across all leads QRS duration, QRS axis, T axis, QTc interval, and 
      heart rate was measured automatically, using 12SL TM algorithm (GE Healthcare, 
      Wauwatosa, WI, USA). Intrinsicoid deflection was measured as the time from QRS 
      complex onset to the alignment point of the QRS complex. TAD was calculated as the 
      difference between QRS duration and intrinsicoid in V1, V2, V3. Reproducibility was 
      quantified by Bland-Altman analysis (bias with 95% limits of agreement), Lin's 
      concordance coefficient, and Bradley-Blackwood procedure. RESULTS: Bland-Altman 
      analysis revealed satisfactory reproducibility of tested parameters. V1 QRS duration 
      bias was -0.10ms [95% limits of agreement -12.77 to 12.56ms], V2 QRS duration bias 
      -0.09ms [-11.13 to 10.96ms]; V1 TAD bias 0.14ms [-13.23 to 13.51ms], V2 TAD bias 
      0.008ms [-12.42 to 12.44ms]. CONCLUSION: Comprehensive statistical evaluation of 
      reproducibility of automated ECG measurements is important for appropriate 
      interpretation of ECG. Automated ECG measurements are reproducible to within 25%.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between heart rate (HR) and 
      optimal reconstruction phase in prospectively electrocardiogram (ECG)-triggered 
      coronary CT angiography (CCTA) performed on a newly introduced 256-slice 
      multidetector CT (MDCT). METHODS: All the cases were selected retrospectively from 
      the patients scheduled for CCTA in our department between January and April 2017. 
      The scanner selected the optimal exposure phase based on 10 s ECG recordings. To 
      ensure the success of CCTA, the operator also checked patient's age, breathing 
      control, emotional status and past medical history to decide whether the 
      automatically selected scan phase needs manual adjustment or not. Images were 
      reconstructed in 1% steps of the R-R interval to determine the cardiac phase with 
      least coronary motion. If CCTA images showed moderate motion blurring or 
      discontinuity in the course of coronary segments, a cardiac motion correction 
      algorithm was applied to the reconstructed images. Subjective diagnostic image 
      quality was evaluated with 4-point grading scale. RESULTS: A total of 87 consecutive 
      CCTA examinations were investigated in this study. Diastolic reconstruction was 
      applied to all vessel segments in patients with HR <63 bpm, where 36.5 and 77.8% of 
      vessel segments were reconstructed with the use of motion correction in HR ≤57 and 
      58-62 bpm, respectively. As for patients with HR ≥63 bpm, 89.3 and 71.7% of vessel 
      segments were reconstructed in diastole in HR 63-67 and ≥68 bpm, respectively, while 
      81 and 100% of vessel segments were reconstructed with the use of motion correction 
      in the same HR groups. CONCLUSION: Based on our results, a HR less than 67 bpm can 
      be used to identify appropriate patients for diastolic reconstruction. Although the 
      motion correction algorithm is an effective approach to reduce the impact of cardiac 
      motion in CCTA, HR control is still important to optimize the image quality of CCTA. 
      The relationship between HR and optimal reconstruction phase established in this 
      study could be further used to tailor the ECG pulsing window for dose reduction in 
      patients undergoing CCTA performed on the 256-slice MDCT. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: The 
      HR thresholds to identify patients who are the best suitable candidates for 
      diastolic or systolic reconstruction are scanner specific. This study investigated 
      the relationship between HR and optimal reconstruction phase in prospectively 
      ECG-triggered CCTA for a newly introduced 256-slice MDCT. Once the relationship is 
      established, it could be used to tailor the ECG pulsing window for radiation dose 
      reduction.

TI  - Multi-arrhythmias detection with an XML rule-based system from 12-Lead 
      Electrocardiogram.
PG  - 4357-4363
LID - 10.19082/4357 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The computer-aided detection of cardiac arrhythmias stills a crucial 
      application in medical technologies. The rule based systems RBS ensure a high level 
      of transparency and interpretability of the obtained results. AIM: To facilitate the 
      diagnosis of the cardiologists and to reduce the uncertainty made in this diagnosis. 
      METHODS: In this research article, we have realized a classification and automatic 
      recognition of cardiac arrhythmias, by using XML rules that represent the 
      cardiologist knowledge. Thirteen experiments with different knowledge bases were 
      realized for improving the performance of the used method in the detection of 13 
      cardiac arrhythmias. In the first 12 experiments, we have designed a specialized 
      knowledge base for each cardiac arrhythmia, which contains just one arrhythmia 
      detection rule. In the last experiment, we applied the knowledge base which contains 
      rules of 12 arrhythmias. We used, for the experiments, an international data set 
      with 279 features and 452 records characterizing 12 leads of ECG signal and social 
      information of patients. The data sets were constructed and published at Bilkent 
      University of Ankara, Turkey. In addition, the second version of the self-developed 
      software "XMLRULE" was used; the software can infer more than one class and 
      facilitate the interpretability of the obtained results. RESULTS: The 12 first 
      experiments give 82.80% of correct detection as the mean of all experiments, the 
      results were between 19% and 100% with a low rate in just one experiment. The last 
      experiment in which all arrhythmias are considered, the results of correct detection 
      was 38.33% with 90.55% of sensibility and 46.24% of specificity. It was clearly show 
      that in these results the good choice of the classification model is very beneficial 
      in terms of performance. The obtained results were better than the published results 
      with other computational methods for the mono class detection, but it was less in 
      multi-class detection. CONCLUSION: The RBS is the most transparent method for 
      cardiac arrhythmias detection and multi arrhythmias detection. It improves an 
      exceptional recognition of arrhythmias, but due to conflicts between rules, 
      multi-arrhythmias and uncertainty of measures, the rate of correct classification 
      was less than the other methods.

TI  - Fuzzy decision tree to classify complex fractionated atrial electrograms.
PG  - 245-55
LID - 10.1515/bmt-2014-0110 [doi]
AB  - Catheter ablation has emerged as an effective treatment strategy for atrial 
      fibrillation (AF) in recent years. During AF, complex fractionated atrial 
      electrograms (CFAE) can be recorded and are known to be a potential target for 
      ablation. Automatic algorithms have been developed to simplify CFAE detection, but 
      they are often based on a single descriptor or a set of descriptors in combination 
      with sharp decision classifiers. However, these methods do not reflect the 
      progressive transition between CFAE classes. The aim of this study was to develop an 
      automatic classification algorithm, which combines the information of a complete set 
      of descriptors and allows for progressive and transparent decisions. We designed a 
      method to automatically analyze CFAE based on a set of descriptors representing 
      various aspects, such as shape, amplitude and temporal characteristics. A fuzzy 
      decision tree (FDT) was trained and evaluated on 429 predefined electrograms. CFAE 
      were classified into four subgroups with a correct rate of 81±3%. Electrograms with 
      continuous activity were detected with a correct rate of 100%. In addition, a 
      percentage of certainty is given for each electrogram to enable a comprehensive and 
      transparent decision. The proposed FDT is able to classify CFAE with respect to 
      their progressive transition and may allow objective and reproducible CFAE 
      interpretation for clinical use.

AB  - Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death worldwide, and coronary 
      artery disease (CAD) is a major contributor. Early-stage CAD can progress if 
      undiagnosed and left untreated, leading to myocardial infarction (MI) that may 
      induce irreversible heart muscle damage, resulting in heart chamber remodeling and 
      eventual congestive heart failure (CHF). Electrocardiography (ECG) signals can be 
      useful to detect established MI, and may also be helpful for early diagnosis of CAD. 
      For the latter especially, the ECG perturbations can be subtle and potentially 
      misclassified during manual interpretation and/or when analyzed by traditional 
      algorithms found in ECG instrumentation. For automated diagnostic systems (ADS), 
      deep learning techniques are favored over conventional machine learning techniques, 
      due to the automatic feature extraction and selection processes involved. This paper 
      highlights various deep learning algorithms exploited for the classification of ECG 
      signals into CAD, MI, and CHF conditions. The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), 
      followed by combined CNN and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models, appear to be the 
      most useful architectures for classification. A 16-layer LSTM model was developed in 
      our study and validated using 10-fold cross-validation. A classification accuracy of 
      98.5% was achieved. Our proposed model has the potential to be a useful diagnostic 
      tool in hospitals for the classification of abnormal ECG signals.

AB  - A novel multimodal and bio-inspired approach to biomedical signal processing and 
      classification is presented in the paper. This approach allows for an automatic 
      semantic labeling (interpretation) of sleep apnea events based the proposed 
      data-driven biomedical signal processing and classification. The presented signal 
      processing and classification methods have been already successfully applied to 
      real-time unimodal brainwaves (EEG only) decoding in brain-computer interfaces 
      developed by the author. In the current project the very encouraging results are 
      obtained using multimodal biomedical (brainwaves and peripheral physiological) 
      signals in a unified processing approach allowing for the automatic semantic data 
      description. The results thus support a hypothesis of the data-driven and 
      bio-inspired signal processing approach validity for medical data semantic 
      interpretation based on the sleep apnea events machine-learning-related 
      classification.

TI  - Free-breathing myocardial T2* mapping using GRE-EPI and automatic non-rigid motion 
      correction.
PG  - 113

LID - 113
AB  - BACKGROUND: Measurement of myocardial T2* is becoming widely used in the assessment 
      of patients at risk for cardiac iron overload. The conventional breath-hold, 
      ECG-triggered, segmented, multi-echo gradient echo (MGRE) sequence used for 
      myocardial T2* quantification is very sensitive to respiratory motion and may not be 
      feasible in patients who are unable to breath-hold. We propose a free-breathing 
      myocardial T2* mapping approach that combines a single-shot gradient-echo 
      echo-planar imaging (GRE-EPI) sequence for T2*-weighted image acquisition with 
      automatic non-rigid motion correction (MOCO) of respiratory motion between 
      single-shot images. METHODS: ECG-triggered T2*-weighted images at different echo 
      times were acquired by a black-blood, single-shot GRE-EPI sequence during 
      free-breathing. A single image at a single TE is acquired in each heartbeat. 
      Automatic non-rigid MOCO was applied to correct for in-plane respiratory motion 
      before pixel-wise T2* mapping. In a total of 117 patients referred for clinical 
      cardiac magnetic resonance exams, the free-breathing MOCO GRE-EPI sequence was 
      compared to the breath-hold segmented MGRE approach. Image quality was scored 
      independently by 2 experienced observers blinded to the particular image acquisition 
      strategy. T2* measurements in the interventricular septum and in the liver were 
      compared for the two methods in all cases with adequate image quality. RESULTS: T2* 
      maps were acquired in all 117 patients using the breath-hold MGRE and the 
      free-breathing MOCO GRE-EPI approaches, including 8 patients with myocardial iron 
      overload and 25 patients with hepatic iron overload. The mean image quality of the 
      free-breathing MOCO GRE-EPI images was scored significantly higher than that of the 
      breath-hold MGRE images by both reviewers. Out of the 117 studies, 21 breath-hold 
      MGRE studies (17.9% of all the patients) were scored to be less than adequate or 
      very poor by both reviewers, while only 2 free-breathing MOCO GRE-EPI studies were 
      scored to be less than adequate image quality. In a comparative evaluation of the 
      images with at least adequate quality, the intra-class correlation coefficients for 
      myocardial and liver T2* were 0.868 and 0.986 respectively (p < 0.001), indicating 
      that the T2* measured by breath-hold MGRE and free-breathing MOCO GRE-EPI were in 
      close agreement. The coefficient of variation between the breath-hold and 
      free-breathing approaches for myocardial and liver T2* were 9.88% and 9.38% 
      respectively. Bland-Altman plots demonstrated good absolute agreement of T2* in the 
      interventricular septum and the liver from the free-breathing and breath-hold 
      approaches (mean differences -0.03 and 0.16 ms, respectively). CONCLUSION: The 
      free-breathing approach described for T2* mapping using MOCO GRE-EPI enables 
      accurate myocardial and liver T2* measurements and is insensitive to respiratory 
      motion.

AB  - The QT interval is regarded as an important biomarker for the assessment of 
      arrhythmia liability, and evidence of QT prolongation has led to the withdrawal and 
      relabeling of numerous compounds. Traditional methods of assessing QT prolongation 
      correct the QT interval for the length of the RR interval (which varies inversely 
      with heart-rate) in a variety of ways. These methods often disagree with each other 
      and do not take into account changes in autonomic state. Correcting the QT interval 
      for RR reduces a bivariate observation (RR, QT) to a univariate observation (QTc). 
      The development of automatic electrocardiogram (ECG) signal acquisition systems has 
      made it possible to collect continuous (so called 'beat-to-beat') ECG data. ECG data 
      collected prior to administration of a compound allow us to define a region for (RR, 
      QT) values that encompasses typical activity. Such reference regions are used in 
      clinical applications to define the 'normal' region of clinical or laboratory 
      measurements. This paper motivates the need for reference regions of (RR, QT) values 
      from beat-to-beat ECG data, and describes a way of constructing these. We introduce 
      a measure of agreement between two reference regions that points to the reliability 
      of 12-lead digital Holter data. We discuss the use of reference regions in 
      establishing baselines for ECG parameters to assist in the evaluation of cardiac 
      risk and illustrate using data from two methodological studies.

LID - 10.1186/1532-429X-15-32 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study proposed a fast and fully automatic calibration system to 
      suppress the dark banding artifacts in balanced steady-state free precession (bSSFP) 
      cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) at 3.0 T. METHODS: Twenty-one healthy 
      volunteers (18 men, 3 women; mean age 24.9 years) participated in this study after 
      providing institutionally approved consent. The optimal frequency was obtained using 
      sweep scans of transition-band low flip-angle bSSFP (bSSFP-L), performed with three 
      conditions: breath-hold plus electrocardiography (ECG) triggering (BH + ECG), 
      breath-hold only (BH), and free breathing (FB). A real-time feedback system was 
      implemented to allow the performing of bSSFP-L calibration scanning and conventional 
      cine bSSFP within one breath-hold. For each scan condition, the optimal phase was 
      estimated using 20-point and 10-point spline fitting. RESULTS: Linear regression 
      analysis indicated high correlation between the optimal phases obtained using BH and 
      FB and those obtained using BH + ECG (R2 = 0.91 to 0.98, n = 21). The optimal phases 
      obtained using 10-point datasets showed high correlation with the 20-point BH + ECG 
      datasets (R2 = 0.92 to 0.99, n = 21); although the within-subject coefficient of 
      variation (wsCV) was larger using 10-point fitting. The variation of repeated 
      measurements was largest with FB acquisition and smallest with BH + ECG acquisition. 
      The optimal frequency obtained by offline calculation and by real-time feedback 
      calibration significantly reduced dark-band artifacts in cine bSSFP images (both 
      p < .01). CONCLUSIONS: The proposed real-time feedback calibration method for bSSFP 
      imaging is rapid and fully automatic. This method could greatly reduce dark-band 
      artifacts in bSSFP images and facilitate clinical CMR at 3.0 T.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained 
      cardiac arrhythmia and a growing healthcare burden worldwide. It is often 
      asymptomatic and may appear as episodes of very short duration; hence, the 
      development of methods for its automatic detection is a challenging requirement to 
      achieve early diagnosis and treatment strategies. The present work introduces a 
      novel method exploiting the relative wavelet energy (RWE) to automatically detect AF 
      episodes of a wide variety in length. METHODS: The proposed method analyzes the 
      atrial activity of the surface electrocardiogram (ECG), i.e., the TQ interval, thus 
      being independent on the ventricular activity. To improve its performance under 
      noisy recordings, signal averaging techniques were applied. The method's performance 
      has been tested with synthesized recordings under different AF variable conditions, 
      such as the heart rate, its variability, the atrial activity amplitude or the 
      presence of noise. Next, the method was tested with real ECG recordings. RESULTS: 
      Results proved that the RWE provided a robust automatic detection of AF under wide 
      ranges of heart rates, atrial activity amplitudes as well as noisy recordings. 
      Moreover, the method's detection delay proved to be shorter than most of previous 
      works. A trade-off between detection delay and noise robustness was reached by 
      averaging 15 TQ intervals. Under these conditions, AF was detected in less than 7 
      beats, with an accuracy higher than 90%, which is comparable to previous works. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Unlike most of previous works, which were mainly based on quantifying 
      the irregular ventricular response during AF, the proposed metric presents two major 
      advantages. First, it can perform successfully even under heart rates with no 
      variability. Second, it consists of a single metric, thus turning its clinical 
      interpretation and real-time implementation easier than previous methods requiring 
      combined indices under complex classifiers.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Left bundle branch block is recognized as a marker of higher risk of 
      death, but the prognostic value of the right bundle branch block in the general 
      population is still controversial. Our aim is to evaluate the risk of overall and 
      cardiovascular mortality in patients with right (RBBB) and left bundle branch block 
      (LBBB) in a large electronic cohort of Brazilian patients. METHODS: This 
      observational retrospective study was developed with the database of digital ECGs 
      from Telehealth Network of Minas Gerais, Brazil (TNMG). All ECGs performed from 2010 
      to 2017 in primary care patients over 16 years old were assessed. The electronic 
      cohort was obtained by linking data from ECG exams (name, sex, date of birth, city 
      of residence) and those from national mortality information system, using standard 
      probabilistic linkage methods (FRIL: Fine-grained record linkage software, v.2.1.5, 
      Atlanta, GA). Only the first ECG of each patient was considered. Clinical data were 
      self-reported, and ECGs were interpreted manually by cardiologists and automatically 
      by the Glasgow University Interpreter software. Hazard ratio (HR) for mortality was 
      estimated using Cox regression. RESULTS: From a dataset of 1,773,689 patients, 
      1,558,421 primary care patients over 16 years old underwent a valid ECG recording 
      during 2010 to 2017. We excluded 17,359 patients that didn't have a valid QRS 
      measure from the Glasgow program and 11,091 patients from the control group that had 
      QRS equal or above 120 ms and were not RBBB or LBBB. Therefore, 1,529,971 were 
      included (median age 52 [Q1:38; Q3:65] years; 40.2% were male). In a mean follow-up 
      of 3.7 years, the overall mortality rate was 3.34%. RBBB was more frequent (2.42%) 
      than LBBB (1.32%). In multivariate analysis, adjusting for sex, age and 
      comorbidities, both patients with RBBB (HR 1.32; CI 95% 1.27-1.37) and LBBB (HR 
      1.69; CI 95% 1.62-1.76) had higher risk of overall mortality. Women with RBBB had an 
      increased risk of all-cause death compared to men (p < 0.001). Cardiovascular 
      mortality was higher in patients with LBBB (HR 1.77; CI 95% 1.55-2.01), but not for 
      RBBB. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with RBBB and LBBB had higher risk of overall mortality. 
      Women with RBBB had more risk of all-cause death than men. LBBB was associated with 
      higher risk of cardiovascular mortality.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The current significant progress in the use of heart rate variability in 
      the solution of many diagnostic and therapeutic problems is determined by the 
      availability of standardized methods of measurement and physiological interpretation 
      of heart rate variability indices on the one hand and the high technological level 
      of state-of-the-art electronic measuring equipment that is used for automatic 
      registration and computer processing of cardio-signals. METHODS: A retrospective 
      analysis of anonymized cardio screening results of 22,433 adult residents of 565 
      settlements (cities and villages) across all 20 administrative districts of the 
      Khmelnytskyi Region (Ukraine) was conducted to find a statistically significant 
      connection between individual heart rate variability parameters and the age of 
      people. RESULTS: Primary statistical analysis and visualization showed a correlation 
      between the selected heart rate variability parameters and the age and sex of the 
      examined persons. The study found values of the predicted age slightly over 
      estimation versus the actual age for very young test subjects and below estimation 
      for elderly subjects. CONCLUSION: The use of neural network computations and the 
      modification of the algorithm through the construction of individual training 
      samples for different age intervals, and the creation of individual ensembles of 
      classification neural networks, therefore achieved a prediction of the age of 
      examined persons based on the values of their time and frequency domain heart rate 
      variability indices, with 87% accuracy for women and 85% accuracy for men in the 
      66-85 years age interval and at least 85% for age groups across the entire sample.

TI  - Removing ECG contamination from EMG recordings: a comparison of ICA-based and other 
      filtering procedures.
PG  - 485-93
LID - 10.1016/j.jelekin.2012.01.001 [doi]
AB  - Trunk muscle electromyography (EMG) is often contaminated by the electrocardiogram 
      (ECG), which hampers data analysis and potentially yields misinterpretations. We 
      propose the use of independent component analysis (ICA) for removing ECG 
      contamination and compared it with other procedures previously developed to 
      decontaminate EMG. To mimic realistic contamination while having uncontaminated 
      reference signals, we employed EMG recordings from peripheral muscles with different 
      activation patterns and superimposed distinct ECG signals that were recorded during 
      rest at conventional locations for trunk muscle EMG. ICA decomposition was performed 
      with and without a separately collected ECG signal as part of the data set and 
      contaminated ICA modes representing ECG were identified automatically. Root mean 
      squared relative errors and correlations between the linear envelopes of 
      uncontaminated and contaminated EMG were calculated to assess filtering effects on 
      EMG amplitude. Changes in spectral content were quantified via mean power 
      frequencies. ICA-based filtering largely preserved the EMG's spectral content. 
      Performance on amplitude measures was especially successful when a separate ECG 
      recording was included. That is, the ICA-based filtering can produce excellent 
      results when EMG and ECG are indeed statistically independent and when mode 
      selection is flexibly adjusted to the data set under study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Knowledge of the normal limits of the electrocardiogram (ECG) is 
      mandatory for establishing which patients have abnormal ECGs. No studies have 
      assessed the reference standards for a Latin American population. Our aim was to 
      establish the normal ranges of the ECG for pediatric and adult Brazilian primary 
      care patients. METHODS: This retrospective observational study assessed all the 
      consecutive 12-lead digital electrocardiograms of primary care patients at least 
      1 year old in Minas Gerais state, Brazil, recorded between 2010 and 2015. ECGs were 
      excluded if there were technical problems, selected abnormalities were present or 
      patients with selected self-declared comorbidities or on drug therapy. Only the 
      first ECG from patients with multiple ECGs was accepted. The University of Glasgow 
      ECG analysis program was used to automatically interpret the ECGs. For each 
      variable, the 1st, 2nd, 50th, 98th and 99th percentiles were determined and results 
      were compared to selected studies. RESULTS: A total of 1,493,905 ECGs were recorded. 
      1,007,891 were excluded and 486.014 were analyzed. This large study provided normal 
      values for heart rate, P, QRS and T frontal axis, P and QRS overall duration, PR and 
      QT overall intervals and QTc corrected by Hodges, Bazett, Fridericia and Framingham 
      formulae. Overall, the results were similar to those from other studies performed in 
      different populations but there were differences in extreme ages and specific 
      measurements. CONCLUSIONS: This study has provided reference values for Latinos of 
      both sexes older than 1 year. Our results are comparable to studies performed in 
      different populations.

TI  - Early classification of pathological heartbeats on wireless body sensor nodes.
PG  - 22532-51
LID - 10.3390/s141222532 [doi]
AB  - Smart Wireless Body Sensor Nodes (WBSNs) are a novel class of unobtrusive, 
      battery-powered devices allowing the continuous monitoring and real-time 
      interpretation of a subject's bio-signals, such as the electrocardiogram (ECG). 
      These low-power platforms, while able to perform advanced signal processing to 
      extract information on heart conditions, are usually constrained in terms of 
      computational power and transmission bandwidth. It is therefore essential to 
      identify in the early stages which parts of an ECG are critical for the diagnosis 
      and, only in these cases, activate on demand more detailed and computationally 
      intensive analysis algorithms. In this work, we present a comprehensive framework 
      for real-time automatic classification of normal and abnormal heartbeats, targeting 
      embedded and resource-constrained WBSNs. In particular, we provide a comparative 
      analysis of different strategies to reduce the heartbeat representation 
      dimensionality, and therefore the required computational effort. We then combine 
      these techniques with a neuro-fuzzy classification strategy, which effectively 
      discerns normal and pathological heartbeats with a minimal run time and memory 
      overhead. We prove that, by performing a detailed analysis only on the heartbeats 
      that our classifier identifies as abnormal, a WBSN system can drastically reduce its 
      overall energy consumption. Finally, we assess the choice of neuro-fuzzy 
      classification by comparing its performance and workload with respect to other 
      state-of-the-art strategies. Experimental results using the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia 
      database show energy savings of as much as 60% in the signal processing stage, and 
      63% in the subsequent wireless transmission, when a neuro-fuzzy classification 
      structure is employed, coupled with a dimensionality reduction technique based on 
      random projections.

PG  - 597-8
LID - 10.1136/bjsports-2015-094764 [doi]
AB  - Sudden cardiac death is the most common cause of unnatural death in football. To 
      prevent and urgently manage sudden cardiac arrest on the football field-of-play, 
      F-MARC (FIFA Medical and Research Centre) has been fully committed to a programme of 
      research, education, standardisation and practical implementation. This strategy has 
      detected football players at medical risk during mandatory precompetition medical 
      assessments. Additionally, FIFA has (1) sponsored internationally accepted 
      guidelines for the interpretation of an athlete's ECG, (2) developed 
      field-of-play-specific protocols for the recognition, response, resuscitation and 
      removal of a football player having sudden cardiac arrest and (3) introduced and 
      distributed the FIFA medical emergency bag which has already resulted in the 
      successful resuscitation of a football player who had a sudden cardiac arrest on the 
      field-of-play. Recently FIFA, in association with the Institute of Sports and 
      Preventive Medicine in Saarbrücken, Germany, established a worldwide Sudden Death 
      Registry with a view to documenting fatal events on the football field-of-play. 
      These activities by F-MARC are testimony to FIFA's continued commitment to 
      minimising sudden cardiac arrest while playing football.

TI  - Sparse Support Vector Machine for Intrapartum Fetal Heart Rate Classification.
PG  - 664-671
LID - 10.1109/JBHI.2016.2546312 [doi]
AB  - Fetal heart rate (FHR) monitoring is routinely used in clinical practice to help 
      obstetricians assess fetal health status during delivery. However, early detection 
      of fetal acidosis that allows relevant decisions for operative delivery remains a 
      challenging task, receiving considerable attention. This contribution promotes 
      sparse support vector machine classification that permits to select a small number 
      of relevant features and to achieve efficient fetal acidosis detection. A 
      comprehensive set of features is used for FHR description, including enhanced and 
      computerized clinical features, frequency domain, and scaling and multifractal 
      features, all computed on a large (1288 subjects) and well-documented database. The 
      individual performance obtained for each feature independently is discussed first. 
      Then, it is shown that the automatic selection of a sparse subset of features 
      achieves satisfactory classification performance (sensitivity 0.73 and specificity 
      0.75, outperforming clinical practice). The subset of selected features (average 
      depth of decelerations MAD(dtrd), baseline level β(0) , and variability H) receives 
      simple interpretation in clinical practice. Intrapartum fetal acidosis detection is 
      improved in several respects: A comprehensive set of features combining clinical, 
      spectral, and scale-free dynamics is used; an original multivariate classification 
      targeting both sparse feature selection and high performance is devised; 
      state-of-the-art performance is obtained on a much larger database than that 
      generally studied with description of common pitfalls in supervised classification 
      performance assessments.

TI  - Semi-automatic software based detection of atrial fibrillation in acute ischaemic 
      stroke and transient ischaemic attack.
PG  - 322-325
LID - 10.1111/ene.13199 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) is often asymptomatic 
      and increases the risk of ischaemic stroke. Detection of PAF is challenging but 
      crucial because a change of treatment decreases the risk of ischaemic stroke. 
      Post-stroke investigations recommend at least 24-h continuous cardiac rhythm 
      monitoring. Extended monitoring detects more PAF but is limited by costs due to 
      manual analysis. Interpretive software might be a reasonable screening tool. The aim 
      was to validate the performance and utility of Pathfinder SL software compared to 
      manual analysis. METHODS: In all, 135 ischaemic stroke patients with no prior 
      history of PAF or atrial fibrillation and who had done a 7-day continuous 
      electrocardiogram monitoring (Holter) were included. Manual analysis was compared 
      with Pathfinder SL software including a systematic control of registered events. 
      RESULTS: Seventeen (12.6%) patients were diagnosed with PAF (atrial fibrillation > 
      30 s). Pathfinder SL software including a systematic control of events registered 16 
      (94.1%) patients with PAF. Manually 15 (88.2%) patients were detected with PAF. 
      Pathfinder SL had a negative predictive value of 99% and sensitivity of 94%. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Pathfinder SL software including a systematic evaluation of events is 
      an acceptable alternative compared to manual analysis in PAF detection following 
      ischaemic stroke. It is less time consuming and therefore a reliable, cheaper 
      alternative compared to manual analysis.

TI  - A novel intra-operative, high-resolution atrial mapping approach.
PG  - 221-5
LID - 10.1007/s10840-015-0061-x [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: A new technique is demonstrated for extensive high-resolution 
      intra-operative atrial mapping that will facilitate the localization of atrial 
      fibrillation (AF) sources and identification of the substrate perpetuating AF. 
      METHODS: Prior to the start of extra-corporal circulation, a 8 × 24-electrode array 
      (2-mm inter-electrode distance) is placed subsequently on all the right and left 
      epicardial atrial sites, including Bachmann's bundle, for recording of unipolar 
      electrograms during sinus rhythm and (induced) AF. AF is induced by high-frequency 
      pacing at the right atrial free wall. A pacemaker wire stitched to the right atrium 
      serves as a reference signal. The indifferent pole is connected to a steal wire 
      fixed to subcutaneous tissue. Electrograms are recorded by a computerized mapping 
      system and, after amplification (gain 1000), filtering (bandwidth 0.5-400 Hz), 
      sampling (1 kHz) and analogue to digital conversion (16 bits), automatically stored 
      on hard disk. During the mapping procedure, real-time visualization secures 
      electrogram quality. Analysis will be performed offline. RESULTS: This technique was 
      performed in 168 patients of 18 years and older, with coronary and/or structural 
      heart disease, with or without AF, electively scheduled for cardiac surgery and a 
      ventricular ejection fraction above 40 %. The mean duration of the entire mapping 
      procedure including preparation time was 9 ± 2 min. Complications related to the 
      mapping procedure during or after cardiac surgery were not observed. CONCLUSIONS: We 
      introduce the first epicardial atrial mapping approach with a high resolution of 
      ≥1728 recording sites which can be performed in a procedure time of only 9±2 mins. 
      This mapping technique can potentially identify areas responsible for initiation and 
      persistence of AF and hopefully can individualize both diagnosis and therapy of AF.

TI  - Automatic Triage of 12-Lead ECGs Using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks.
PG  - e015138
LID - 10.1161/JAHA.119.015138 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND The correct interpretation of the ECG is pivotal for the accurate 
      diagnosis of many cardiac abnormalities, and conventional computerized 
      interpretation has not been able to reach physician-level accuracy in detecting 
      (acute) cardiac abnormalities. This study aims to develop and validate a deep neural 
      network for comprehensive automated ECG triage in daily practice. METHODS AND 
      RESULTS We developed a 37-layer convolutional residual deep neural network on a data 
      set of free-text physician-annotated 12-lead ECGs. The deep neural network was 
      trained on a data set with 336.835 recordings from 142.040 patients and validated on 
      an independent validation data set (n=984), annotated by a panel of 5 cardiologists 
      electrophysiologists. The 12-lead ECGs were acquired in all noncardiology 
      departments of the University Medical Center Utrecht. The algorithm learned to 
      classify these ECGs into the following 4 triage categories: normal, abnormal not 
      acute, subacute, and acute. Discriminative performance is presented with overall and 
      category-specific concordance statistics, polytomous discrimination indexes, 
      sensitivities, specificities, and positive and negative predictive values. The 
      patients in the validation data set had a mean age of 60.4 years and 54.3% were men. 
      The deep neural network showed excellent overall discrimination with an overall 
      concordance statistic of 0.93 (95% CI, 0.92-0.95) and a polytomous discriminatory 
      index of 0.83 (95% CI, 0.79-0.87). CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrates that an 
      end-to-end deep neural network can be accurately trained on unstructured free-text 
      physician annotations and used to consistently triage 12-lead ECGs. When further 
      fine-tuned with other clinical outcomes and externally validated in clinical 
      practice, the demonstrated deep learning-based ECG interpretation can potentially 
      improve time to treatment and decrease healthcare burden.

TI  - The application of root mean square electrocardiography (RMS ECG) for the detection 
      of acquired and congenital long QT syndrome.
PG  - e85689
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0085689 [doi]
LID - e85689
AB  - BACKGROUND: Precise measurement of the QT interval is often hampered by difficulty 
      determining the end of the low amplitude T wave. Root mean square 
      electrocardiography (RMS ECG) provides a novel alternative measure of ventricular 
      repolarization. Experimental data have shown that the interval between the RMS ECG 
      QRS and T wave peaks (RTPK) closely reflects the mean ventricular action potential 
      duration while the RMS T wave width (TW) tracks the dispersion of repolarization 
      timing. Here, we tested the precision of RMS ECG to assess ventricular 
      repolarization in humans in the setting of drug-induced and congenital Long QT 
      Syndrome (LQTS). METHODS: RMS ECG signals were derived from high-resolution 24 hour 
      Holter monitor recordings from 68 subjects after receiving placebo and moxifloxacin 
      and from standard 12 lead ECGs obtained in 97 subjects with LQTS and 97 age- and 
      sex-matched controls. RTPK, QTRMS and RMS TW intervals were automatically measured 
      using custom software and compared to traditional QT measures using lead II. 
      RESULTS: All measures of repolarization were prolonged during moxifloxacin 
      administration and in LQTS subjects, but the variance of RMS intervals was 
      significantly smaller than traditional lead II measurements. TW was prolonged during 
      moxifloxacin and in subjects with LQT-2, but not LQT-1 or LQT-3. CONCLUSION: These 
      data validate the application of RMS ECG for the detection of drug-induced and 
      congenital LQTS. RMS ECG measurements are more precise than the current standard of 
      care lead II measurements.

TI  - Best-Quality Vessel Identification Using Vessel Quality Measure in Multiple-Phase 
      Coronary CT Angiography.
PG  - 1835297
LID - 1835297
AB  - The detection of stenotic plaques strongly depends on the quality of the coronary 
      arterial tree imaged with coronary CT angiography (cCTA). However, it is time 
      consuming for the radiologist to select the best-quality vessels from the 
      multiple-phase cCTA for interpretation in clinical practice. We are developing an 
      automated method for selection of the best-quality vessels from coronary arterial 
      trees in multiple-phase cCTA to facilitate radiologist's reading or computerized 
      analysis. Our automated method consists of vessel segmentation, vessel registration, 
      corresponding vessel branch matching, vessel quality measure (VQM) estimation, and 
      automatic selection of best branches based on VQM. For every branch, the VQM was 
      calculated as the average radial gradient. An observer preference study was 
      conducted to visually compare the quality of the selected vessels. 167 corresponding 
      branch pairs were evaluated by two radiologists. The agreement between the first 
      radiologist and the automated selection was 76% with kappa of 0.49. The agreement 
      between the second radiologist and the automated selection was also 76% with kappa 
      of 0.45. The agreement between the two radiologists was 81% with kappa of 0.57. The 
      observer preference study demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed automated 
      method for the selection of the best-quality vessels from multiple cCTA phases.

AB  - Biosignals such as electrocardiograms (ECG), electroencephalograms (EEG), and 
      electromyograms (EMG), are important noninvasive measurements useful for making 
      diagnostic decisions. Recently, considerable research has been conducted in order to 
      potentially automate signal classification for assisting in disease diagnosis. 
      However, the biosignal type (ECG, EEG, EMG or other) needs to be known prior to the 
      classification process. If the given biosignal is of an unknown type, none of the 
      existing methodologies can be utilized. In this paper, a blind biosignal 
      classification model (B(2)SC Model) is proposed in order to identify the source 
      biosignal type automatically, and thus ultimately benefit the diagnostic decision. 
      The approach employs time series algorithms for constructing the model. It uses a 
      dynamic time warping (DTW) algorithm with clustering to discover the similarity 
      between two biosignals, and consequently classifies disease without prior knowledge 
      of the source signal type. The empirical experiments presented in this paper 
      demonstrate the effectiveness of the method as well as the scalability of the 
      approach.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: High frequency QRS (HFQRS) analysis has been shown to be an accurate 
      marker for myocardial ischemia. Our objective was to test the use of HFQRS in 
      diagnosing ACS in the emergency department. METHODS: 324 patients presenting to the 
      ED with chest pain were enrolled. Resting ECG was recorded and later analyzed by an 
      HFQRS algorithm. Results were compared to the conventional ECG diagnosis by 3 
      independent interpretations: treating physician, expert cardiologist and an 
      automated computer program. RESULTS: The HFQRS analysis demonstrated improved 
      sensitivity (67.5%) for the NSTE-ACS group compared to the human interpreters (59.7% 
      and 53.2% for the treating physician and cardiologist respectively) with similar 
      specificity. The automatic program had significantly lower sensitivity (31%) with a 
      higher specificity (77%). CONCLUSIONS: HFQRS which has shown great promise in 
      diagnosing stable CAD may also be helpful in the ED for diagnosing ACS.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the feasibility of automated co-registration of angiography 
      and intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) to facilitate integration of these two imaging 
      modalities in a synchronous manner. BACKGROUND: IVUS provides cross-sectional 
      imaging of coronary arteries but lacks overview of the vascular territory provided 
      by angiography. Co-registration of angiography and IVUS would increase utility of 
      IVUS in the clinical setting. METHODS: Forty-nine consecutive patients undergoing 
      surveillance for cardiac allograft vasculopathy with angiography and IVUS of the 
      left anterior descending artery (LAD) were enrolled. A pre-IVUS angiogram of the LAD 
      was performed followed by an ECG-triggered fluoroscopy (ECGTF) during IVUS pullback 
      at 0.5 mm/s using an automatic pullback device. ECGTF was used to track the IVUS 
      catheter during pullback and establish a spatial relationship to the pre-IVUS 
      angiogram. Angio-IVUS co-registration was performed with a research prototype 
      (Siemens Healthcare, Germany) and accuracy was evaluated by distance mismatch 
      between angiography and IVUS images at vessel bifurcations. RESULTS: Median age was 
      54 (44.5, 67) years. The population was 82.6% male with minimal risk factors. The 
      median (IQR) co-registration distance mismatch measured at 108 bifurcations in 42 
      (85%) patients was 0.35 (0.00-1.16) mm. Seven patients were excluded due to 
      inappropriate data acquisition (n = 3) and failure of tracking (n = 4), e.g., due to 
      overlapping sternal wires. Estimated effective radiation dose for ECGTF was 
      0.09 mSv. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the feasibility of angio-IVUS 
      co-registration which may be used as a clinical tool for localizing IVUS 
      cross-sections along an angiographic roadmap. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI  - Sorted Golden-step phase encoding: an improved Golden-step imaging technique for 
      cardiac and respiratory self-gated cine cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Numerous self-gated cardiac imaging techniques have been reported in the 
      literature. Most can track either cardiac or respiratory motion, and many incur some 
      overhead to imaging data acquisition. We previously described a Cartesian cine 
      imaging technique, pseudo-projection motion tracking with golden-step phase 
      encoding, capable of tracking both cardiac and respiratory motion at no cost to 
      imaging data acquisition. In this work, we describe improvements to the technique by 
      dramatically reducing its vulnerability to eddy current and flow artifacts and 
      demonstrating its effectiveness in expanded cardiovascular applications. METHODS: As 
      with our previous golden-step technique, the Cartesian phase encodes over time were 
      arranged based on the integer golden step, and readouts near k(y) = 0 
      (pseudo-projections) were used to derive motion. In this work, however, the readouts 
      were divided into equal and consecutive temporal segments, within which the readouts 
      were sorted according to k(y). The sorting reduces the phase encode jump between 
      consecutive readouts while maintaining the pseudo-randomness of k(y) to sample both 
      cardiac and respiratory motion without comprising the ability to retrospectively set 
      the temporal resolution of the original technique. On human volunteers, 
      free-breathing, electrocardiographic (ECG)-free cine scans were acquired for all 
      slices of the short axis stack and the 4-chamber view of the long axis. 
      Retrospectively, cardiac motion and respiratory motion were automatically extracted 
      from the pseudo-projections to guide cine reconstruction. The resultant image 
      quality in terms of sharpness and cardiac functional metrics was compared against 
      breath-hold ECG-gated reference cines. RESULTS: With sorting, motion tracking of 
      both cardiac and respiratory motion was effective for all slices orientations 
      imaged, and artifact occurrence due to eddy current and flow was efficiently 
      eliminated. The image sharpness derived from the self-gated cines was found to be 
      comparable to the reference cines (mean difference less than 0.05 mm(- 1) for 
      short-axis images and 0.075 mm(- 1) for long-axis images), and the functional 
      metrics (mean difference < 4 ml) were found not to be statistically different from 
      those from the reference. CONCLUSIONS: This technique dramatically reduced the eddy 
      current and flow artifacts while preserving the ability of cost-free motion tracking 
      and the flexibility of choosing arbitrary navigator zone width, number of cardiac 
      phases, and duration of scanning. With the restriction of the artifacts removed, the 
      Cartesian golden-step cine imaging can now be applied to cardiac imaging slices of 
      more diverse orientation and anatomy at greater reliability.

AB  - Published scientific literature contains millions of figures, including information 
      about the results obtained from different scientific experiments e.g. PCR-ELISA 
      data, microarray analysis, gel electrophoresis, mass spectrometry data, DNA/RNA 
      sequencing, diagnostic imaging (CT/MRI and ultrasound scans), and medicinal imaging 
      like electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG), echocardiography  
      (ECG), positron-emission tomography (PET) images. The importance of biomedical 
      figures has been widely recognized in scientific and medicine communities, as they 
      play a vital role in providing major original data, experimental and computational 
      results in concise form. One major challenge for implementing a system for 
      scientific literature analysis is extracting and analyzing text and figures from 
      published PDF files by physical and logical document analysis. Here we present a 
      product line architecture based bioinformatics tool 'Mining Scientific Literature 
      (MSL)', which supports the extraction of text and images by interpreting all kinds 
      of published PDF files using advanced data mining and image processing techniques. 
      It provides modules for the marginalization of extracted text based on different 
      coordinates and keywords, visualization of extracted figures and extraction of 
      embedded text from all kinds of biological and biomedical figures using applied 
      Optimal Character Recognition (OCR). Moreover, for further analysis and usage, it 
      generates the system's output in different formats including text, PDF, XML and 
      images files. Hence, MSL is an easy to install and use analysis tool to interpret 
      published scientific literature in PDF format.

TI  - A decision support system for real-time stress detection during virtual reality 
      exposure.
PG  - 114-20
AB  - Virtual Reality (VR) is increasingly being used in combination with 
      psycho-physiological measures to improve assessment of distress in mental health 
      research and therapy. However, the analysis and interpretation of multiple 
      physiological measures is time consuming and requires specific skills, which are not 
      available to most clinicians. To address this issue, we designed and developed a 
      Decision Support System (DSS) for automatic classification of stress levels during 
      exposure to VR environments. The DSS integrates different biosensor data (ECG, 
      breathing rate, EEG) and behavioral data (body gestures correlated with stress), 
      following a training process in which self-rated and clinical-rated stress levels 
      are used as ground truth. Detected stress events for each VR session are reported to 
      the therapist as an aggregated value (ranging from 0 to 1) and graphically displayed 
      on a diagram accessible by the therapist through a web-based interface.

TI  - Free breathing three-dimensional cardiac quantitative susceptibility mapping for 
      differential cardiac chamber blood oxygenation - initial validation in patients with 
      cardiovascular disease inclusive of direct comparison to invasive catheterization.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Differential blood oxygenation between left (LV) and right ventricles 
      (RV; ΔSaO(2)) is a key index of cardiac performance; LV dysfunction yields increased 
      RV blood pool deoxygenation. Deoxyhemoglobin increases blood magnetic 
      susceptibility, which can be measured using an emerging cardiovascular magnetic 
      resonance (CMR) technique, Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping (QSM) - a concept 
      previously demonstrated in healthy subjects using a breath-hold 2D imaging approach 
      (2D(BH)QSM). This study tested utility of a novel 3D free-breathing QSM approach 
      (3D(NAV)QSM) in normative controls, and validated 3D(NAV)QSM for non-invasive 
      ΔSaO(2) quantification in patients undergoing invasive cardiac catheterization 
      (cath). METHODS: Initial control (n = 10) testing compared 2D(BH)QSM (ECG-triggered 
      2D gradient echo acquired at end-expiration) and 3D(NAV)QSM (ECG-triggered navigator 
      gated gradient echo acquired in free breathing using a phase-ordered automatic 
      window selection algorithm to partition data based on diaphragm position). Clinical 
      testing was subsequently performed in patients being considered for cath, including 
      3D(NAV)QSM comparison to cine-CMR quantified LV function (n = 39), and invasive-cath 
      quantified ΔSaO(2) (n = 15). QSM was acquired using 3 T scanners; analysis was 
      blinded to comparator tests (cine-CMR, cath). RESULTS: 3D(NAV)QSM generated 
      interpretable QSM in all controls; 2D(BH)QSM was successful in 6/10. Among controls 
      in whom both pulse sequences were successful, RV/LV susceptibility difference (and 
      ΔSaO(2)) were not significantly different between 3D(NAV)QSM and 2D(BH)QSM 
      (252 ± 39 ppb [17.5 ± 3.1%] vs. 211 ± 29 ppb [14.7 ± 2.0%]; p = 0.39). Acquisition 
      times were 30% lower with 3D(NAV)QSM (4.7 ± 0.9 vs. 6.7 ± 0.5 min, p = 0.002), 
      paralleling a trend towards lower LV mis-registration on 3D(NAV)QSM (p = 0.14). 
      Among cardiac patients (63 ± 10y, 56% CAD) 3D(NAV)QSM was successful in 87% (34/39) 
      and yielded higher ΔSaO(2) (24.9 ± 6.1%) than in controls (p < 0.001). 
      QSM-calculated ΔSaO(2) was higher among patients with LV dysfunction as measured on 
      cine-CMR based on left ventricular ejection fraction (29.4 ± 5.9% vs. 20.9 ± 5.7%, 
      p < 0.001) or stroke volume (27.9 ± 7.5% vs. 22.4 ± 5.5%, p = 0.013). Cath 
      measurements (n = 15) obtained within a mean interval of 4 ± 3 days from CMR 
      demonstrated 3D(NAV)QSM to yield high correlation (r = 0.87, p < 0.001), small bias 
      (- 0.1%), and good limits of agreement (±8.6%) with invasively measured ΔSaO(2). 
      CONCLUSION: 3D(NAV)QSM provides a novel means of assessing cardiac performance. 
      Differential susceptibility between the LV and RV is increased in patients with 
      cine-CMR evidence of LV systolic dysfunction; QSM-quantified ΔSaO(2) yields high 
      correlation and good agreement with the reference of invasively-quantified ΔSaO(2).

AB  - Early repolarization associated with sudden cardiac death is based on the presence 
      of >1-mm J-point elevations in inferior and/or lateral leads with horizontal and/or 
      downsloping ST segments. Automated electrocardiographic readings of early 
      repolarization (AER) obtained in clinical practice, in contrast, are defined by 
      ST-segment elevation in addition to J-point elevation. Nonetheless, such automated 
      readings may cause alarm. We therefore assessed the prevalence and prognostic 
      significance of AER in 211,920 patients aged 18 to 75 years. The study was performed 
      at a tertiary medical center serving a racially diverse urban population with a 
      large proportion of Hispanics (43%). The first recorded electrocardiogram of each 
      individual from 2000 to 2012 was included. Patients with ventricular paced rhythm or 
      acute coronary syndrome at the time of acquisition were excluded from the analysis. 
      All automated electrocardiographic interpretations were reviewed for accuracy by a 
      board-certified cardiologist. The primary end point was death during a median 
      follow-up of 8.0 ± 2.6 years. AER was present in 3,450 subjects (1.6%). The 
      prevalence varied significantly with race (African-Americans 2.2%, Hispanics 1.5%, 
      and non-Hispanic whites 0.9%, p <0.01) and gender (male 2.4% vs female 0.6%, p 
      <0.001). In a Cox proportional hazards model controlling for age, smoking status, 
      heart rate, QTc, systolic blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, body 
      mass index, and coronary artery disease, there was no significant difference in 
      mortality regardless of race or gender (relative risk 0.98, 95% confidence interval 
      0.89 to 1.07). This was true even if J waves were present. In conclusion, AER was 
      not associated with an increased risk of death, regardless of race or gender, and 
      should not trigger additional diagnostic testing.

AB  - PURPOSE: We evaluated the usefulness of an automatic slice-alignment method to 
      simplify planning of cardiac magnetic resonance (MR) scans with a 3-tesla scanner. 
      METHODS: We obtained 2-dimensional (2D) axial multislice images using steady-state 
      free precession (SSFP) sequences covering the whole heart at the end-diastole phase 
      with electrocardiography (ECG) gating in 38 patients. We detected several anatomical 
      feature points of the heart and calculated all planes required for cardiac imaging 
      based on those points. We visually evaluated the acceptability of an acquired 
      imaging plane and measured the angular differences of each view between the results 
      obtained by this method and by a conventional manual pointing approach. RESULTS: The 
      average visual scores were 3.4 ± 1.0 for short-axis images, 3.2 ± 0.9 for 4-chamber 
      images, 3.2 ± 0.8 for 2-chamber images, and 3.3 ± 0.8 for 3-chamber images; average 
      angular differences were 5.8 ± 5.1 (short axis), 7.7 ± 5.7 (4-chamber), 11.5 ± 6.7 
      (2-chamber), and 9.1 ± 4.6 degrees (3-chamber). Processing time was within 1.8 s in 
      all subjects. CONCLUSION: The proposed method can provide planes within the 
      clinically acceptable range and within a short time in cardiac imaging of patients 
      with various cardiac shapes and diseases without the need for high level operator 
      proficiency in performing the examination and interpreting results.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the feasibility of non-electrocardiogram (ECG)-triggered 
      70-kVp high-pitch aortic computed tomography angiography (CTA) with iterative 
      reconstruction (IR) and reduced contrast agent using second-generation dual-source 
      CT (DSCT). METHODS: Seventy-seven patients were examined: group A (n = 21), 70-kVp 
      high-pitch (3.2) CTA, 60 mL contrast agent and IR on second-generation DSCT; group B 
      (n = 29), standard-pitch (1.2) CTA, automatic tube voltage selection, filtered back 
      projection and 80 mL contrast agent on second-generation DSCT; group C (n = 27), 
      120-kVp standard-pitch (1.2) CTA, filtered back projection, and 80 mL contrast agent 
      on first-generation DSCT. Computed tomography values, noise, signal-to-noise ratio, 
      contrast-to-noise ratio, and subjective image quality were compared. RESULTS: 
      Computed tomography values and noise of all aortic segments in group A were 
      increased compared with groups B and C (P < 0.05). Group B showed the highest 
      signal-to-noise ratio and contrast-to-noise ratio for all aortic segments (P < 
      0.05), whereas no significant differences were found between groups A and C (P > 
      0.05). Mean effective dose was 0.88 ± 0.08 mSv for group A, reduced by 93% compared 
      to group C and by 90% compared to group B. CONCLUSIONS: Non-ECG-triggered 70-kVp 
      high-pitch aortic CTA with IR provides equivalent diagnostic image quality with 90% 
      reduction of radiation dose and 25% reduction of contrast volume compared with 
      standard 120-kVp CTA.

TI  - An obstructive sleep apnea detection approach using kernel density classification 
      based on single-lead electrocardiogram.
PG  - 47
LID - 10.1007/s10916-015-0222-6 [doi]
AB  - Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common sleep disorder that often remains 
      undiagnosed, leading to an increased risk of developing cardiovascular diseases. 
      Polysomnogram (PSG) is currently used as a golden standard for screening OSA. 
      However, because it is time consuming, expensive and causes discomfort, alternative 
      techniques based on a reduced set of physiological signals are proposed to solve 
      this problem. This study proposes a convenient non-parametric kernel density-based 
      approach for detection of OSA using single-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings. 
      Selected physiologically interpretable features are extracted from segmented RR 
      intervals, which are obtained from ECG signals. These features are fed into the 
      kernel density classifier to detect apnea event and bandwidths for density of each 
      class (normal or apnea) are automatically chosen through an iterative bandwidth 
      selection algorithm. To validate the proposed approach, RR intervals are extracted 
      from ECG signals of 35 subjects obtained from a sleep apnea database ( 
      http://physionet.org/cgi-bin/atm/ATM ). The results indicate that the kernel density 
      classifier, with two features for apnea event detection, achieves a mean accuracy of 
      82.07 %, with mean sensitivity of 83.23 % and mean specificity of 80.24 %. Compared 
      with other existing methods, the proposed kernel density approach achieves a 
      comparably good performance but by using fewer features without significantly losing 
      discriminant power, which indicates that it could be widely used for home-based 
      screening or diagnosis of OSA.

TI  - To sort or not to sort: the impact of spike-sorting on neural decoding performance.
PG  - 056005
LID - 10.1088/1741-2560/11/5/056005 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are a promising technology for restoring 
      motor ability to paralyzed patients. Spiking-based BCIs have successfully been used 
      in clinical trials to control multi-degree-of-freedom robotic devices. Current 
      implementations of these devices require a lengthy spike-sorting step, which is an 
      obstacle to moving this technology from the lab to the clinic. A viable alternative 
      is to avoid spike-sorting, treating all threshold crossings of the voltage waveform 
      on an electrode as coming from one putative neuron. It is not known, however, how 
      much decoding information might be lost by ignoring spike identity. APPROACH: We 
      present a full analysis of the effects of spike-sorting schemes on decoding 
      performance. Specifically, we compare how well two common decoders, the optimal 
      linear estimator and the Kalman filter, reconstruct the arm movements of non-human 
      primates performing reaching tasks, when receiving input from various sorting 
      schemes. The schemes we tested included: using threshold crossings without 
      spike-sorting; expert-sorting discarding the noise; expert-sorting, including the 
      noise as if it were another neuron; and automatic spike-sorting using waveform 
      features. We also decoded from a joint statistical model for the waveforms and 
      tuning curves, which does not involve an explicit spike-sorting step. MAIN RESULTS: 
      Discarding the threshold crossings that cannot be assigned to neurons degrades 
      decoding: no spikes should be discarded. Decoding based on spike-sorted units 
      outperforms decoding based on electrodes voltage crossings: spike-sorting is useful. 
      The four waveform based spike-sorting methods tested here yield similar decoding 
      efficiencies: a fast and simple method is competitive. Decoding using the joint 
      waveform and tuning model shows promise but is not consistently superior. 
      SIGNIFICANCE: Our results indicate that simple automated spike-sorting performs as 
      well as the more computationally or manually intensive methods used here. Even basic 
      spike-sorting adds value to the low-threshold waveform-crossing methods often 
      employed in BCI decoding.

TI  - Cardiac arrythmias: multimodal assessment integrating body surface ECG mapping into 
      cardiac imaging.
PG  - 239-47
LID - 10.1148/radiol.13131331 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To demonstrate the feasibility of comprehensive assessment of cardiac 
      arrhythmias by combining body surface electrocardiographic (ECG) mapping (BSM) and 
      imaging. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was approved by the institutional review 
      board, and all patients gave written informed consent. Twenty-seven patients 
      referred for electrophysiologic procedures in the context of ventricular tachycardia 
      (VT) (n = 9), Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome (n = 2), atrial fibrillation (AF) 
      (n = 13), or scar-related ventricular fibrillation (VF) (n = 3) were examined. 
      Patients underwent BSM and imaging with multidetector computed tomography (CT) (n = 
      12) and/or delayed enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging (n = 23). BSM was 
      performed by using a 252-electrode vest that enabled the computation of epicardial 
      electrograms from body surface potentials. The epicardial geometry used for BSM was 
      registered to the epicardial geometry segmented from imaging data by using an 
      automatic algorithm. The output was a three-dimensional cardiac model that 
      integrated cardiac anatomy, myocardial substrate, and epicardial activation. 
      RESULTS: Acquisition, segmentation, and registration were feasible in all patients. 
      In VT, this enabled a noninvasive assessment of the arrhythmia mechanism and its 
      location with respect to the myocardial substrate, coronary vessels, and phrenic 
      nerve. In WPW syndrome, this enabled understanding of complex accessory pathways 
      resistant to previous ablation. In AF and VF, this enabled the noninvasive 
      assessment of arrhythmia mechanisms and the analysis of rotor trajectories with 
      respect to the myocardial substrate. In all patients, models were successfully 
      integrated in navigation systems and used to guide mapping and ablation. CONCLUSION: 
      By combining information on anatomy, substrate, and electrical activation, the 
      fusion of BSM and imaging enables comprehensive noninvasive assessment of cardiac 
      arrhythmias, with potential applications for diagnosis, prognosis, and ablation 
      targeting. Online supplemental material is available for this article.

TI  - Home monitoring of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators: interpretation 
      reliability of the second-generation "IEGM Online" system.
PG  - 584-90
LID - 10.1093/europace/euu349 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Intracardiac electrograms (IEGMs) are essential for the assessment of 
      implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) function. The Biotronik Home Monitoring 
      systems transmit an 'IEGM Online' that is shorter than the full-length programmer 
      IEGM due to technical constrains. The aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy 
      of the physician's classification of the underlying rhythm based on the 
      second-generation IEGM Online. METHODS AND RESULTS: In total, 1533 patients treated 
      with single- and dual-chamber ICDs and cardiac resynchronization therapy 
      defibrillators were enrolled at 67 investigational sites and followed for 15 months. 
      The investigators classified the rhythm shown in IEGM Online as ventricular 
      tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, atrial fibrillation, other supraventricular 
      tachyarrhythmia, oversensing due to lead failure, T-wave oversensing, or other 
      rhythm. At the next in-office follow-up, the investigators classified independently 
      the rhythm seen in the corresponding programmer IEGM. The two rhythm classifications 
      were compared thereafter. Both IEGM Online and programmer IEGM were available in 
      2099 arrhythmic or oversensing events, of which 146 (7.0%) were classified as other 
      rhythm or artefacts and were excluded as inconclusive or atypical. The remaining 
      1953 events, affecting 352 patients (23.0%), were classified correctly in 1803 cases 
      (92.3%). The accuracy of rough rhythm classification as ventricular, 
      supraventricular, or oversensing was 97.2%. CONCLUSION: The Lumax and IEGM Online HD 
      Evaluation study demonstrates that remote IEGM analysis is reasonably accurate in a 
      remote monitoring system that transmits shorter IEGM than the full-length programmer 
      IEGM for the sake of frequent, fully automatic data transmission.

      a 120 kV tube voltage setting. In all subjects the heart rate (HR) was <65 bpm and 
      all CT scans were acquired using a prospective ECG gating and AEC strategy. Mean 
      effective radiation dose and subjective and objective (Noise or N, signal to noise 
      ratio or SNR, contrast to noise ratio or CNR) image quality, were evaluated. 
      Subjective quality was assessed by two experienced radiologists using a 5-point 
      scale (0: non diagnostic-4: excellent) using the 15-segment American Heart 
      Association (AHA) coronary artery classification. RESULTS: Mean effective dose and 
      noise were non significantly different between the two groups: mean effective dose 
      was 2.89 ± 0.7 mSv in the 100 kV group and 2.80 ± 0.57 mSv in the 120 kV group 
      (p = 0.25) while noise was 28.9 ± 3.3 in the 120 kV group and 29.05 ± 3.6 in the 
      100 kV group (p = 0.72). Both SNR and CNR were significantly higher in the 100 kV 
      group than in the 120 kV group. This data agrees with the evidence that subjective 
      quality was significantly higher in the 100 kV group in the middle and distal 
      segmental classes. CONCLUSION: Our study shows that, in using a 320 row CCTA with 
      AEC strategy it is better to employ a 100 kV tube voltage protocol because compared 
      to 120 kV tube voltage setting, it appears to significantly improve both subjective 
      and objective image quality without decreasing the mean effective radiation dose.

AB  - Lately, multimodal approaches for automatic emotion recognition have gained 
      significant scientific interest. In this paper, emotion recognition by combining 
      physiological signals and facial expressions was studied. Heart rate variability 
      parameters, respiration frequency, and facial expressions were used to classify 
      person's emotions while watching pictures with emotional content. Three classes were 
      used for both valence and arousal. The preliminary results show that, over the 
      proposed channels, detecting arousal seem to be easier compared to valence. While 
      the classification performance of 54.5% was attained with arousal, only 38.0% of the 
      samples were classified correctly in terms of valence. In future, additional 
      modalities as well as feature selection will be utilized to improve the results.

TI  - A novel T wave cancellation method based on MAP estimation for P wave extraction.
PG  - S1559-68
LID - 10.3233/BME-151455 [doi]
AB  - P wave and T wave in human-body electrocardiogram (ECG) signals often fuse together 
      when atrial premature contract (APC) occurs. P waves within the fused signals are 
      valuable for the measurement of P wave parameters as well as diagnosis of 
      supra-ventricular arrhythmias. However, the problem of extracting P wave from the 
      fused signals is seldom addressed. In this study, a novel T wave cancellation method 
      for P wave extraction based on maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation is proposed. In 
      order to accurately cancel the T wave within the fused signal, T wave and the timing 
      point of T wave peak are estimated simultaneously. The estimated timing point of T 
      wave peak is used as alignment reference point for T wave subtraction. Simulation 
      results show that the proposed method outperform the traditional T wave cancellation 
      method in terms of both normalized mean square error and cross-correlation index. 
      The results for real ECGs with APC demonstrate that the extracted P waves using the 
      proposed method are more similar to the non-overlapping P waves in terms of 
      morphology than the ones using the traditional T wave cancellation method.

TI  - An integrated diabetic index using heart rate variability signal features for 
      diagnosis of diabetes.
PG  - 222-34
LID - 10.1080/10255842.2011.616945 [doi]
AB  - Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals are difficult to interpret, and clinicians must 
      undertake a long training process to learn to diagnose diabetes from subtle 
      abnormalities in these signals. To facilitate these diagnoses, we have developed a 
      technique based on the heart rate variability signal obtained from ECG signals. This 
      technique uses digital signal processing methods and, therefore, automates the 
      detection of diabetes from ECG signals. In this paper, we describe the signal 
      processing techniques that extract features from heart rate (HR) signals and present 
      an analysis procedure that uses these features to diagnose diabetes. Through 
      statistical analysis, we have identified the correlation dimension, Poincaré 
      geometry properties (SD2), and recurrence plot properties (REC, DET, L(mean)) as 
      useful features. These features differentiate the HR data of diabetic patients from 
      those of patients who do not have the illness, and have been validated by using the 
      AdaBoost classifier with the perceptron weak learner (yielding a classification 
      accuracy of 86%). We then developed a novel diabetic integrated index (DII) that is 
      a combination of these nonlinear features. The DII indicates whether a particular HR 
      signal was taken from a person with diabetes. This index aids the automatic 
      detection of diabetes, thereby allowing a more objective assessment and freeing 
      medical professionals for other tasks.

TI  - Use of self-gated radial cardiovascular magnetic resonance to detect and classify 
      arrhythmias (atrial fibrillation and premature ventricular contraction).
PG  - 83
LID - 83
AB  - BACKGROUND: Arrhythmia can significantly alter the image quality of cardiovascular 
      magnetic resonance (CMR); automatic detection and sorting of the most frequent types 
      of arrhythmias during the CMR acquisition could potentially improve image quality. 
      New CMR techniques, such as non-Cartesian CMR, can allow self-gating: from cardiac 
      motion-related signal changes, we can detect cardiac cycles without an 
      electrocardiogram. We can further use this data to obtain a surrogate for RR 
      intervals (valley intervals: VV). Our purpose was to evaluate the feasibility of an 
      automated method for classification of non-arrhythmic (NA) (regular cycles) and 
      arrhythmic patients (A) (irregular cycles), and for sorting of common arrhythmia 
      patterns between atrial fibrillation (AF) and premature ventricular contraction 
      (PVC), using the cardiac motion-related signal obtained during self-gated 
      free-breathing radial cardiac cine CMR with compressed sensing reconstruction 
      (XD-GRASP). METHODS: One hundred eleven patients underwent cardiac XD-GRASP CMR 
      between October 2015 and February 2016; 33 were included for retrospective analysis 
      with the proposed method (6 AF, 8 PVC, 19 NA; by recent ECG). We analyzed the VV, 
      using pooled statistics (histograms) and sequential analysis (Poincaré plots), 
      including the median (medVV), the weighted mean (meanVV), the total number of VV 
      values (VVval), and the total range (VVTR) and half range (VVHR) of the cumulative 
      frequency distribution of VV, including the median to half range (medVV/VVHR) and 
      the half range to total range (VVHR/VVTR) ratios. We designed a simple algorithm for 
      using the VV results to differentiate A from NA, and AF from PVC. RESULTS: Between 
      NA and A, meanVV, VVval, VVTR, VVHR, medVV/VVHR and VVHR/VVTR ratios were 
      significantly different (p values = 0.00014, 0.0027, 0.000028, 5×10(-9), 0.002, 
      respectively). Between AF and PVC, meanVV, VVval and medVV/VVHR ratio were 
      significantly different (p values = 0.018, 0.007, 0.044, respectively). Using our 
      algorithm, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 93 %, 95 % and 94 % to 
      discriminate between NA and A, and 83 %, 71 %, and 77 % to discriminate between AF 
      and PVC, respectively; areas under the ROC curve were 0.93 and 0.89. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Our study shows we can reliably detect arrhythmias and differentiate AF from PVC, 
      using self-gated cardiac cine XD-GRASP CMR.

TI  - Beat to beat 3-dimensional intracardiac echocardiography: theoretical approach and 
      practical experiences.
PG  - 753-64
LID - 10.1007/s10554-012-0136-z [doi]
AB  - Three-dimensional (3D)-imaging provides important information on cardiac anatomy 
      during electrophysiological procedures. Real-time updates of modalities with high 
      soft-tissue contrast are particularly advantageous during cardiac procedures. 
      Therefore, a beat to beat 3D visualization of cardiac anatomy by intracardiac 
      echocardiography (ICE) was developed and tested in phantoms and animals. An 
      electronic phased-array 5-10 MHz ICE-catheter (Acuson, AcuNav/Siemens Medical 
      Solutions USA/64 elements) providing a 90° sector image was used for ICE-imaging. A 
      custom-made mechanical prototype controlled by a servo motor allowed automatic 
      rotation of the ICE-catheter around its longitudinal axis. During a single 
      heartbeat, the ICE-catheter was rotated and 2D-images were acquired. Reconstruction 
      into a 3D volume and rendering by a prototype software was performed beat to beat. 
      After experimental validation using a rigid phantom, the system was tested in an 
      animal study and afterwards, for quantitative validation, in a dynamic phantom. 
      Acquisition of beat to beat 3D-reconstruction was technically feasible. However, 
      twisting of the ICE-catheter shaft due to friction and torsion was found and 
      rotation was hampered. Also, depiction of catheters was not always ensured in case 
      of parallel alignment. Using a curved sheath for depiction of cardiac anatomy there 
      was no congruent depiction of shape and dimension of static and moving objects. Beat 
      to beat 3D-ICE-imaging is feasible. However, shape and dimension of static and 
      moving objects cannot always be displayed with necessary steadiness as needed in the 
      clinical setting. As catheter depiction is also limited, clinical use seems 
      impossible.

TI  - Extracting Fundamental Periods to Segment Biomedical Signals.

LID - 10.1109/JBHI.2015.2466440 [doi]
AB  - We address the problem of segmenting nearly periodic time series into period-like 
      segments. We introduce a definition of nearly periodic time series via triplets 〈 
      basic shape, shape transformation, time scaling 〉 that covers a wide range of time 
      series. To split the time series into periods, we select a pair of principal 
      components of the Hankel matrix. We then cut the trajectory of the selected 
      principal components by its symmetry axis and, thus, obtaining half-periods that are 
      merged into segments. We describe a method of automatic selection of periodic pairs 
      of principal components, corresponding to the fundamental periodicity. We 
      demonstrate the application of the proposed method to the problem of period 
      extraction for accelerometric time series of human gait. We see the automatic 
      segmentation into periods as a problem of major importance for human activity 
      recognition problem, since it allows to obtain interpretable segments: each 
      extracted period can be seen as an ultimate entity of gait. The method we propose is 
      more general compared to the application specific methods and can be used for any 
      nearly periodical time series. We compare its performance to classical mathematical 
      methods of period extraction and find that it is not only comparable to the 
      alternatives, but in some cases performs better.

TI  - Common pitfalls in interpreting pacemaker electrocardiograms in the emergency 
      department.
PG  - 616-21
LID - 10.1016/j.jelectrocard.2011.07.018 [doi]
AB  - The number of patients receiving pacemakers and defibrillators has grown 
      substantially over the last 20 years. In addition, the complexity and sophistication 
      of these devices have increased, making diagnosis of pacemaker problems using the 
      electrocardiogram (ECG) more difficult for clinicians in the emergency department. 
      This article will focus on a few of the pitfalls to be avoided when interpreting 
      paced ECGs. Pacemaker algorithms designed to minimize right ventricular pacing may 
      be confused with pathologic failure to output. Automatic capture threshold detection 
      schemes may be misinterpreted as failure to capture as well as undersensing due to 
      the extra "backup" pacemaker spikes noted on rhythm strips. Device testing done in 
      the emergency department may produce waveforms on monitor resembling ventricular 
      tachycardia if pacemaker-mediated tachycardia is produced accidentally. Ventricular 
      safety pacing algorithms may also be misinterpreted as failure to sense 
      appropriately, triggering questions about pacemaker malfunction. Certain types of 
      true undersensing may resemble morphologies consistent with pacemaker lead 
      dislodgment. In addition, sophisticated programming features designed to mimic 
      normal physiology could be misconstrued as pacemaker malfunction. These include 
      pacemaker hysteresis and sleep mode. The presence of frequent premature ventricular 
      complexes would cause a pacemaker to inhibit ventricular pacing appropriately. 
      However, this could produce a palpated heart rate that is substantially lower than 
      the programmed lower rate of the device due to reduced perfusion by the premature 
      ventricular complexes, again raising questions about the appropriate functioning of 
      the pacemaker. All of these situations will be discussed in detail along with 
      approaches to systematically examining the paced ECGs to minimize the risk of 
      misinterpretation. Pacemaker timing cycles as they relate to troubleshooting of the 
      paced ECG will also be introduced.

      angiography using an automatic tube potential selection technique.
PG  - 89-94
LID - 10.1007/s10554-014-0526-5 [doi]
AB  - To investigate the image quality and the minimum required radiation dose for 
      automatic tube potential selection (ATPS) in dual-source computed tomography (DSCT) 
      coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA). Three hundred twenty-five 
      consecutive patients (153 men and 172 women) undergoing CCTA were assigned to either 
      the ATPS group (n = 172) or the control group (n = 153); the control group underwent 
      imaging at a constant current of 120 kV. All patients were scanned in either 
      prospectively ECG-triggered high-pitch helical mode or sequential mode. The 
      subjective image quality score, attenuation, image noise, signal-to-noise ratio 
      (SNR), contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), volume CT dose index (CTDIvol), and effective 
      dose (ED) were compared between the two groups with the Student t test or 
      Mann-Whitney U test. The subjective image quality score was not significantly 
      different between the two groups. Imaging noise and attenuation were both 
      significantly higher in the ATPS group than in the control group (imaging noise: 
      25.6 ± 7.6 versus 15.8 ± 4.0 HU, P < 0.001; attenuation: 559.6 ± 142.0 versus 
      412.5 ± 64.3 HU, P < 0.001). SNR and CNR were significantly lower in the ATPS group 
      than in the control group (SNR: 23.21 ± 7.40 versus 27.71 ± 8.25, P < 0.001; CNR: 
      27.81 ± 8.44 versus 33.94 ± 9.69, P < 0.001). ED was significantly lower in the ATPS 
      group than in the control group (ED: 1.25 ± 1.24 versus 2.19 ± 1.77 mSv, P < 0.001). 
      For both groups, ED was significantly lower in the high-pitch mode than in the 
      sequential mode. The use of ATPS for CCTA significantly reduced the radiation dose 
      while maintaining image quality.

TI  - Retrospective reconstruction of cardiac cine images from golden-ratio radial MRI 
      using one-dimensional navigators.
PG  - 413-22
LID - 10.1002/jmri.24364 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To demonstrate radial golden-ratio-based cardiac cine imaging by using 
      interspersed one-dimensional (1D) navigators. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The 1D 
      navigators were interspersed into the acquisition of radial spokes which were 
      continuously rotated by an angle increment based on the golden-ratio. Performing 
      correlation analysis between the 1D navigator projections, time points corresponding 
      to the same cardiac motion phases were automatically identified and used to combine 
      retrospectively golden-ratio rotated radial spokes from multiple data windows. Data 
      windows were shifted consecutively for dynamic reconstruction of different cardiac 
      motion frames. Experiments were performed during a single breathhold. By 
      artificially reducing the amount of input data, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and 
      contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) as well as artifact level was evaluated for different 
      breathhold durations. RESULTS: Analysis of the 1D navigator data provided a detailed 
      correlation function revealing cardiac motion over time. Imaging results were 
      comparable to images reconstructed based on a timely synchronized ECG. Cardiac cine 
      images with a low artifact level and good image quality in terms of SNR and CNR were 
      reconstructed from volunteer data achieving a CNR between the myocardium and the 
      left ventricular cavity of 50 for the longest breathhold duration of 26 s. CNR 
      maintained a value higher than 30 for acquisition times as low as 10 s. CONCLUSION: 
      Combining radial golden-ratio-based imaging with an intrinsic navigator is a 
      promising and robust method for performing high quality cardiac cine imaging.

AB  - Heart rate variability (HRV) is a particularly valuable quantitative marker of the 
      flexibility and balance of the autonomic nervous system. Significant advances in 
      software programs to automatically derive HRV have led to its extensive use in 
      psychophysiological research. However, there is a lack of systematic comparisons 
      across software programs used to derive HRV indices. Further, researchers report 
      meager details on important signal processing decisions making synthesis across 
      studies challenging. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the measurement 
      fidelity of time- and frequency-domain HRV indices derived from three predominant 
      signal processing software programs commonly used in clinical and research settings. 
      Triplicate ECG recordings were derived from 20 participants using identical data 
      acquisition hardware. Among the time-domain indices, there was strong to excellent 
      correspondence (ICC(avg)=0.93) for SDNN, SDANN, SDNNi, rMSSD, and pNN50. The 
      frequency-domain indices yielded excellent correspondence (ICC(avg)=0.91) for LF, 
      HF, and LF/HF ratio, except for VLF which exhibited poor correspondence 
      (ICC(avg)=0.19). Stringent user-decisions and technical specifications for nuanced 
      HRV processing details are essential to ensure measurement fidelity across signal 
      processing software programs.

AB  - Enlargement and dysfunction of the right ventricle (RV) is a sign and outcome 
      predictor of many cardiopulmonary diseases. Due to the complex geometry of the RV 
      exact volumetry is cumbersome and time-consuming. We evaluated the performance of 
      prototype software for fully automated RV segmentation and volumetry from cardiac CT 
      data. In 50 retrospectively ECG-gated coronary CT angiography scans the endsystolic 
      (RVVmin) and enddiastolic (RVVmax) volume of the right ventricle was calculated 
      fully automatically by prototype software. Manual slice segmentation by two 
      independent radiologists served as the reference standard. Measurement periods were 
      compared for both methods. RV volumes calculated with the software were in strong 
      agreement with the results from manual slice segmentation (Bland-Altman r = 
      0.95-0.98; p < 0.001; Lin's correlation Rho = 0.87-0.96, p < 0.001) for RVVmax and 
      RVVmin with excellent interobserver agreement between both radiologists (r = 0.97; p 
      < 0.001). The measurement period was significantly shorter with the software (153 ± 
      9 s) than with manual slice segmentation (658 ± 211 s). The prototype software 
      demonstrated very good performance in comparison to the reference standard. It 
      promises robust RV volume results and minimizes postprocessing time.

AB  - Real-time remote health monitoring systems are experiencing tremendous advancement 
      resulting from improvements in low power, reliable sensors; yet they are still 
      constrained to low-level interpretation. Automatic data analysis continues to be a 
      tedious task due to a lack of efficient, reliable platforms for data analysis. In 
      this paper, we present a system for monitoring patients remotely by emphasizing the 
      strength of Complex Event Processing (CEP) and Situation Awareness. In this 
      approach, the system makes decisions in a declarative way, which helps medical 
      experts to understand the situation in a more realistic manner. The primary 
      objective of this paper is to explicate the different components inside the system. 
      To verify the technical feasibility of each component, the proposed system is 
      implemented and tested using ECG data.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to assess by a census supported by the Italian 
      Society of Cardiology (Società Italiana di Cardiologia, SIC) the present 
      implementation of telemedicine in the field of cardiovascular disease in Italy. 
      METHODS: A dedicated questionnaire was sent by email to all the members of the SIC: 
      data on telemedicine providers, service provided, reimbursement, funding and 
      organisational solutions were collected and analysed. RESULTS: Reported telemedicine 
      activities were mostly stable and public hospital based, focused on acute 
      cardiovascular disease and prehospital triage of suspected acute myocardial 
      infarction (prehospital ECG, always interpreted by a cardiologist and not 
      automatically reported by computerised algorithms). Private companies delivering 
      telemedicine services in cardiology (ECGs, ambulatory ECG monitoring) were also 
      present. In 16% of cases, ECGs were also delivered through pharmacies or general 
      practitioners. ICD/CRT-D remote control was performed in 42% of cases, heart failure 
      patient remote monitoring in 37% (21% vital parameters monitoring, 32% nurse 
      telephone monitoring). Telemedicine service was public in 74% of cases, paid by the 
      patient in 26%. About half of telemedicine service received no funding, 17% received 
      State and/or European Union funding. CONCLUSIONS: Several telemedicine activities 
      have been reported for the management of acute and chronic cardiovascular disease in 
      Italy. The whole continuum of cardiovascular disease is covered by telemedicine 
      solutions. A periodic census may be useful to assess the implementation of 
      guidelines recommendations on telemedicine.

TI  - [Initial observation of oxygen carriers with acute myocardial infarction in rats].
PG  - 1095-9
AB  - The purpose of this study was to test whether oxygen carriers could decrease tissue 
      injury in a rat model of acute myocardial infarct. The study included 3 groups: SD 
      rats in group II and group III were subjected to permanent occlusion of their left 
      anterior descending coronary arteries; SD rats in group I were subjected to 
      sham-operation. The success of modeling was assartained by ECG. Then the rats were 
      given drug via caudal veins for 2 days. A quantitative evaluation was made with an 
      automatic device for interpretation of cardiac troponin T (cTnT); heart staining was 
      made for the calculation of myocardial infarction size (MIS); and myocardial tissue 
      was taken and subjected to routine pathological hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining for 
      showing myocardial cell injury. cTnT in the sham-operation group was significantly 
      lower by comparison with that in the model group (P < 0.01), and it was slightly 
      lower in the oxygen carriers group than that in the model group, but there was no 
      statistically significant difference (P = 0.18); MIS was significantly smaller in 
      the sham-operation group than that in the model group (P < 0.01), and it was greater 
      in the model rats than that in the oxygen carriers rats (P < 0.05). HE staining of 
      myocardicum in the oxygen carriers group was significantly better than that in the 
      model group (P < 0.01). The evidence suggested that oxygen carriers increased oxygen 
      supply to ischemic myocardium, reduced the myocardial injury, and thus might offer a 
      novel treatment of myocardial infarction.

PG  - 601-5

AB  - Continuous electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring of cardiac patients on a long-term, 
      even permanent, basis has become possible. Postsurgical cases, those with 
      significant risk factors, or patients with chronic conditions are candidates for 
      these procedures to assess evolving risk factors and detect life-threatening events. 
      A small sensing device can be implanted subcutaneously to assess the ECG, 
      transmitting status and alerts to local caregivers or a remote monitoring service. 
      We and others have shown that a differential electrode pair with only 2- to 3-cm 
      spacing can produce QRS amplitudes greater than 1 mV, sufficient to accurately 
      identify asystole, tachyarrhythmias, and ST-segment changes. Medtronic's REVEAL and 
      St Jude Medical's CONFIRM are implantable look recorders (ILRs) with a single pair 
      of subcutaneous electrodes mounted on the surface of the case (6 × 2 × 0.7 cm). They 
      store representative rhythm strips when the heart rate exceeds preset limits or when 
      the patient presses a button on the accompanying actuator. These records may be 
      transferred for physician review during a subsequent office visit. Transoma's SLEUTH 
      is a similar ILR, except that one of the electrodes is at the end of a 6-cm lead 
      tunneled under the skin and the wider separation may result in a larger ECG 
      amplitude. Instead of storing the records, SLEUTH transmits them through the skin to 
      a home base unit, which sends them via telephone to a monitoring service. Angel 
      Medical's ALERT system also has a tunneled lead, but one that is introduced 
      pervenously into the right ventricle hoping to detect ST changes in addition to 
      rhythm abnormalities. Advanced multivector ILR devices with integrated event 
      alerting are rapidly approaching commercialization. AJ Medical Devices' CARDIOALARM 
      (4 × 4 × 0.6 cm) has 4 electrodes at the corners of the square package, arranged as 
      2 orthogonal recording pairs that can produce a robust signal that is relatively 
      immune to signal fluctuations caused by changes in the direction of cardiac 
      activation and patient's body position. This permits accurate identification of 
      dramatic changes in the ECG pattern, such as those occurring in ventricular 
      fibrillation and polymorphic tachycardia. Because of this feature, CARDIOALARM can 
      detect cardiac arrest, and its external receiver can alert bystanders to begin 
      cardiopulmonary resuscitation and can automatically summon Emergency Medical 
      Services. In the future, addition of other sensors, integration of data streams via 
      body surface wireless networks, and real-time interpretive algorithms will allow 
      enhanced monitoring systems to more generally assess evolving risks, the impacts of 
      therapeutic interventions, and patient compliance with rehabilitative programs. When 
      coupled to remote medical monitoring services, these devices have the potential to 
      dramatically impact patient outcomes by lessening the diagnostic dependence on 
      symptom recognition and decreasing event response times. Significant cost savings 
      may also be realized through more efficient use of specialist resources, reduction 
      in the number of office visits to physicians, and long-term improvements in patient 
      health. Structural and behavior barriers to adoption need to be addressed for these 
      methods to reach their full potential, addressing patient privacy concerns, adequate 
      reimbursement, and integration into standard care protocols.

PG  - e016598
LID - 10.1161/JAHA.120.016598 [doi]
AB  - The primary goal of the initial ECG evaluation of every wide complex tachycardia is 
      to determine whether the tachyarrhythmia has a ventricular or supraventricular 
      origin. The answer to this question drives immediate patient care decisions, ensuing 
      clinical workup, and long-term management strategies. Thus, the importance of 
      arriving at the correct diagnosis cannot be understated and has naturally spurred 
      rigorous research, which has brought forth an ever-expanding abundance of manually 
      applied and automated methods to differentiate wide complex tachycardias. In this 
      review, we provide an in-depth analysis of traditional and more contemporary methods 
      to differentiate ventricular tachycardia and supraventricular wide complex 
      tachycardia. In doing so, we: (1) review hallmark wide complex tachycardia 
      differentiation criteria, (2) examine the conceptual and structural design of 
      standard wide complex tachycardia differentiation methods, (3) discuss practical 
      limitations of manually applied ECG interpretation approaches, and (4) highlight 
      recently formulated methods designed to differentiate ventricular tachycardia and 
      supraventricular wide complex tachycardia automatically.

AB  - RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effect of dual-bolus contrast media 
      injection (dual-CM) on the accuracy of automated right ventricular (RV) segmentation 
      on coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total 
      of 104 patients with suspected and known coronary artery disease underwent 256-slice 
      CCTA with retrospective electrocardiographic (ECG) gating. The patients were divided 
      into 51 patients who underwent single-bolus CM injection (single-CM) and 53 patients 
      who underwent dual-CM. The dual-CM method consisted of an initial bolus of CM 
      followed by an injection of dilute CM with saline (CM:saline, 1:9). 
      Three-dimensional CCTA images were automatically segmented into the RV, left 
      ventricle (LV), and myocardium using commercially available software (Comprehensive 
      Cardiac Analysis; Philips Medical Systems, Cleveland, OH). Prevalence and locations 
      of segmentation errors were compared between single-CM and dual-CM. Segmentation 
      errors were defined as segment deviation of >1 cm from the actual ventricular 
      margin. RESULTS: Prevalence of segmentation errors was significantly lower with 
      dual-CM than with single-CM in the diastolic phase (4/41 vs. 20/41, respectively; P 
      < .01), and there was no difference between the two methods in the systolic phase 
      (2/12 vs. 2/10, respectively). With dual-CM and single-CM, the locations of 
      segmentation errors were mostly the RV wall (4/53 and 18/51, respectively) and 
      secondly the LV wall (2/53 and 9/51, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Dual-CM improved 
      the accuracy of automated ventricular segmentation using diastolic data from 
      256-slice CCTA.

AB  - To assess agreement between two semi-automatic, three-dimensional (3D) computed 
      tomography (CT) ventricular volumetry methods with different user interactions in 
      patients with congenital heart disease. In 30 patients with congenital heart disease 
      (median age 8 years, range 5 days-33 years; 20 men), dual-source, multi-section, 
      electrocardiography-synchronized cardiac CT was obtained at the end-systolic 
      (n = 22) and/or end-diastolic (n = 28) phase. Nineteen left ventricle end-systolic 
      (LV ESV), 28 left ventricle end-diastolic (LV EDV), 22 right ventricle end-systolic 
      (RV ESV), and 28 right ventricle end-diastolic volumes (RV EDV) were successfully 
      calculated using two semi-automatic, 3D segmentation methods with different user 
      interactions (high in method 1, low in method 2). The calculated ventricular volumes 
      of the two methods were compared and correlated. A P value <0.05 was considered 
      statistically significant. LV ESV (35.95 ± 23.49 ml), LV EDV (88.76 ± 61.83 ml), and 
      RV ESV (46.87 ± 47.39 ml) measured by method 2 were slightly but significantly 
      smaller than those measured by method 1 (41.25 ± 26.94 ml, 92.20 ± 62.69 ml, 
      53.61 ± 50.08 ml for LV ESV, LV EDV, and RV ESV, respectively; P ≤ 0.02). In 
      contrast, no statistically significant difference in RV EDV (122.57 ± 88.57 ml in 
      method 1, 123.83 ± 89.89 ml in method 2; P = 0.36) was found between the two 
      methods. All ventricular volumes showed very high correlation (R = 0.978, 0.993, 
      0.985, 0.997 for LV ESV, LV EDV, RV ESV, and RV EDV, respectively; P < 0.001) 
      between the two methods. In patients with congenital heart disease, 3D CT 
      ventricular volumetry shows good agreement and high correlation between the two 
      methods, but method 2 tends to slightly underestimate LV ESV, LV EDV, and RV ESV.

TI  - Initial Experience of the Application of Automated Tube Potential Selection 
      Technique in High-pitch Dual-source CT Angiography of Whole Aorta Using 
      Third-generation Dual-source CT Scanner.
PG  - 62-67

AB  - Objective To evaluate the application of automated tube potential selection 
      technique in high-pitch dual-source CT aortic angiography on a third-generation 
      dual-source CT scanner. Methods Whole aorta angiography were indiated in 59 
      patients,who were divided into 2 groups using a simple random method:in group 1 
      there were 31 patients who underwent the examination with automated tube potential 
      selection using a vascular setting with a preferred image quality of 288 mA/100 
      kV;in group 2 there were 28 patients who underwent the examination with a tube 
      voltage of 100 kV and automated tube current modulation using a reference tube 
      current of 288 mA. Both groups were scanned on a third generation dual-source CT 
      device operated in dual-source high-pitch ECG-gating mode with a pitch of 
      3.0,collimation of 2×192×0.6 mm,and a rotation time of 0.25 s. Iterative 
      reconstruction algorithm was used. For group 1,the volume and flow of contrast 
      medium and chasing saline were adapted to the tube voltage. For group 2,a contrast 
      material bolus of 45 ml with a flow of 4.5 ml/s followed by a 50 ml saline chaser at 
      5 ml/s was used. CTA scan was automatically started using a bolus tracking technique 
      at the level of the original part of aorta after a trigger threshold of 100 HU was 
      reached. The start delay was set to 6 s in both groups. Effective dose (ED),signal 
      to noise ratio (SNR),contrast to noise ratio (CNR),and subjective diagnostic quality 
      of both groups were evaluated. Results The mean ED were 21.3% lower 
      (t=-3.099,P=0.000) in group 1 [(2.48±0.80) mSv] than in group 2 [(3.15±0.86) mSv]. 
      Two groups showed no significant difference in attenuation,SD,SNR,or CNR at all 
      evaluational parts of aorta (ascending aorta,aortic arch,diaphragmatic aorta,or 
      iliac bifurcation)(all P>0.05). There was no significant difference in subjective 
      diagnostic quality values of two groups [(1.41±0.50) scores vs. (1.39±0.50) 
      scores;W=828.5,P=0.837]. Conclusion Compared with automated tube current 
      modulation,the automated tube potential selection technique in aorta CT angiography 
      on a third-generation dual-source CT can dramatically reduce radiation dose without 
      affecting image quality.

AB  - This report describes a form of group beating induced by a St Jude dual chamber ICD 
      which interpreted a ventricular escape rhythm (with retrograde conduction) as 
      premature ventricular complexes (PVC). These pacemaker-defined PVCs activated the 
      atrial pace-PVC algorithm in 2 steps. 1. The postventricular atrial refractory 
      period (PVARP) was terminated upon detecting a retrograde P wave within its 
      unblanked portion, and 2. An atrial stimulus was released 330ms after the end of the 
      PVARP. This response resulted in automatic mode switching because the 330ms 
      interatrial interval was shorter than the atrial tachycardia detection interval. The 
      arrhythmia may be considered to represent an unusual form of pacemaker 
      escape-capture bigeminy.

AB  - The computer-aided interpretation of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals provides a 
      non-invasive and inexpensive technique for analyzing heart activity under various 
      cardiac conditions. Further, the proliferation of smartphones and wireless networks 
      makes it possible to perform continuous Holter monitoring. However, although 
      considerable attention has been paid to automated detection and classification of 
      heartbeats from ECG data, classifier learning strategies have never been used to 
      deal with individual variations in cardiac activity. In this paper, we propose a 
      novel method for automatic classification of an individual׳s ECG beats for Holter 
      monitoring. We use the Pan-Tompkins algorithm to accurately extract features such as 
      the QRS complex and P wave, and employ a decision tree to classify each beat in 
      terms of these features. Evaluations conducted against the MIT-BIH arrhythmia 
      database before and after personalization of the decision tree using a patient׳s own 
      ECG data yield heartbeat classification accuracies of 94.6% and 99%, respectively. 
      These are comparable to results obtained from state-of-the-art schemes, validating 
      the efficacy of our proposed method.

AB  - AIM: To assess the effect of two iterative reconstruction algorithms (AIDR and 
      AIDR3D) and individualized automatic tube current selection on radiation dose and 
      image quality in computed tomography coronary angiography (CTCA). MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: In a single-centre cohort study, 942 patients underwent 
      electrocardiogram-gated CTCA using a 320-multidetector CT system. Images from group 
      1 (n = 228) were reconstructed with a filtered back projection algorithm (Quantum 
      Denoising Software, QDS+). Iterative reconstruction was used for group 2 (AIDR, 
      n = 379) and group 3 (AIDR3D, n = 335). Tube current was selected based on body mass 
      index (BMI) for groups 1 and 2, and selected automatically based on scout image 
      attenuation for group 3. Subjective image quality was graded on a four-point scale 
      (1 = excellent, 4 = non-diagnostic). RESULTS: There were no differences in age 
      (p = 0.975), body mass index (p = 0.435), or heart rate (p = 0.746) between the 
      groups. Image quality improved with iterative reconstruction and automatic tube 
      current selection [1.3 (95% confidence intervals (CI): 1.2-1.4), 1.2 (1.1-1.2) and 
      1.1 (1-1.2) respectively; p < 0.001] and radiation dose decreased [274 (260-290), 
      242 (230-253) and 168 (156-180) mGy cm, respectively; p < 0.001]. CONCLUSION: The 
      application of the latest iterative reconstruction algorithm and individualized 
      automatic tube current selection can substantially reduce radiation dose whilst 
      improving image quality in CTCA.

TI  - Novel simple approach for detection of regional perturbations of cardiac function in 
      mouse models of cardiovascular disease.
PG  - 843-9
LID - 10.1111/echo.12138 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Transthoracic murine echocardiography is a cornerstone of small animal 
      research, but conventional methods cannot detect regional perturbations in cardiac 
      function. Reliable assessment of regional cardiac function would be of value in 
      transgenic models of myocardial disease. Until now automatized algorithms for 
      achieving this suffers from a number of drawbacks. We developed a simple algorithm 
      for rapidly assessing the relative myocardial radial thickening that occurs between 
      end-diastole and end-systole, that is, regional radial transmural end-systolic 
      strain (RTESS). METHODS AND RESULTS: Echocardiographic assessment was performed in 
      mice at baseline (n = 8), 2 hours postintraperitoneal isoprenaline (ISO) injection 
      (n = 8), and 10 days postmyocardial infarction (post-MI) (n = 6). A >1000 frames/sec 
      cine loop was acquired by the ECG-gated Kilohertz visualization technique in the 
      parasternal short-axis projection at 3 mm below the mitral annulus. Endo- and 
      epicardial borders were traced at end-diastole and end-systole and RTESS was 
      calculated for each of n segments by the algorithm. The intra- and inter-observer 
      coefficients of variation for segmental RTESS assessment were 5.11 and 7.32, 
      respectively. At baseline, average segmental RTESS was 56.75% and RTESS was similar 
      in all cardiac segments regardless of how many segments the heart was divided into. 
      In the akinetic myocardium of MI and ISO mice, 47.36% and 26.22% length of the 
      endocardium, respectively, RTESS was near zero and significantly different from the 
      remaining myocardium. CONCLUSION: We describe a simple and straightforward approach 
      to quantify regional myocardial deformation in mouse models of cardiovascular 
      disease.

TI  - Comparison of automated 4-chamber cardiac views versus axial views for measuring 
      right ventricular enlargement in patients with suspected pulmonary embolism.
PG  - 218-22
LID - 10.1016/j.ejrad.2011.01.041 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Compare the right ventricle to left ventricle (RV/LV) diameter ratio 
      obtained from axial pulmonary CT angiograms (CTPA) with those derived from 
      automatically generated 4-chamber (4-CH) reformats in patients with suspected 
      pulmonary embolism (PE). METHODS: In this institutional review board-approved study 
      we included 120 consecutive non ECG-gated CTPA from 3 institutions (mean age 60 ± 16 
      years; 71 women). Twenty 64-slice CTPA with PE and 20 without PE were selected per 
      institution. For each patient the RV/LV diameter ratio was obtained from both axial 
      CTPA images and automatically generated 4-CH reformats. Measurements were performed 
      twice in two separated sessions by 2 experienced radiologists and 2 residents. The 
      differences between the measurements on both views were evaluated. RESULTS: The 4-CH 
      view was successfully obtained in 113 patients. The mean axial and 4-CH diameter 
      ratios were comparable for three of the four readers (p = 0.56, p = 0.13, p = 0.08). 
      Although the mean diameters (1.0 and 1.03 respectively) for one resident were 
      significantly different (p = 0.013), the difference of 0.03 seems negligible in 
      clinical routine. Three readers achieved equally high intra-reader agreements with 
      both measurements (ICCs of 0.94, 0.95 and 0.96), while one reader showed a different 
      variability with ICCs of 0.96 for the axial view and 0.91 for the 4-CH view. The 
      inter-reader agreement was equally high for both measurement types with ICCs of 0.95 
      and 0.94, respectively. CONCLUSION: In patients with suspected PE, RV/LV diameters 
      ratio can be measured with the same reproducibility and accuracy using an 
      automatically generated 4-CH view compared to the axial view.

TI  - Detection of myocardial edema with low-b-value diffusion-weighted echo-planar 
      imaging sequence in patients with acute myocarditis.
PG  - 362-9
LID - 10.1148/radiol.13121811 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the performance of a low-b-value diffusion-weighted (DW) 
      echo-planar (EP) imaging sequence for detection of regional and diffuse myocardial 
      edema in patients with acute myocarditis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was 
      approved by the institutional review board, and informed consent was obtained from 
      all subjects. Thirteen patients with acute myocarditis and a control group of seven 
      healthy adults underwent low-b-value (50 sec/mm(2)) DW cardiac magnetic resonance 
      imaging. DW EP images were acquired in the four-chamber long-axis section and 
      analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively. Short inversion time inversion-recovery 
      (STIR) T2-weighted and late gadolinium chelate enhancement images were acquired in 
      the same plane and analyzed. Late gadolinium chelate enhancement was used as the 
      reference standard. Statistical analyses were performed with a receiver operating 
      characteristic analysis and a nonparametric Wilcoxon test. RESULTS: Qualitative 
      analysis showed myocardial high-signal-intensity areas in 100% (13 of 13) of 
      patients on DW EP, 38% (five of 13) on STIR T2-weighted, and 100% (13 of 13) on late 
      gadolinium chelate enhancement images. In eight patients (61%), 
      high-signal-intensity areas were exhibited on DW EP images that were not detected on 
      STIR T2-weighted images, but were colocalized with lesions detected on late 
      gadolinium chelate enhancement images. Similar results were obtained by using an 
      automatic analysis with dedicated cardiac software. The global myocardial signal 
      intensity ratio was significantly higher (P = .03) in patients than in controls for 
      DW EP (2.2 ± 0.4 [standard deviation] vs 1.1 ± 0.4, respectively), and exhibited no 
      significant difference (P = .14) for STIR T2-weighted (1.7 ± 0.6 vs 1.4 ± 0.1, 
      respectively) images. Sensitivity and diagnostic accuracy were higher for DW EP 
      images than for STIR T2-weighted images (92% vs 54%, and 95% vs 70%, respectively), 
      and specificity was the same (100% vs 100%). CONCLUSION: A low-b-value DW EP imaging 
      sequence is a feasible alternative to the standard STIR T2-weighted sequence for 
      detection of regional and global myocardium edema in patients with acute 
      myocarditis. SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL:

TI  - Effectiveness best R-R reconstruction interval determination software for the 
      evaluation of dual-source coronary CT angiography examinations.
PG  - 229-34
LID - 10.1097/RCT.0b013e318204dcd6 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of automated 
      best R-R interval determination software for the evaluation of dual-source coronary 
      multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) angiography. METHODS: One hundred and nine 
      consecutive patients who underwent dual-source coronary MDCT angiography are 
      included in the study. The indications were chest pain syndrome of low-intermediate 
      risk and/or nonspecific electrocardiographic changes (n = 91), stenting (n = 9), and 
      bypass grafts (n = 9). Imaging was performed using dual-source MDCT. Temporal 
      resolution was 0.83 milliseconds and slice thickness was 0.6 mm. None of the 
      patients received β-blockers. Best R-R interval software has determined the best 
      intervals in diastole and systole. The visibility of coronary arteries was evaluated 
      using 15-segment (total 1635 segments) AHA classification by 2 radiologists in 
      consensus. RESULTS: The mean patient age was 55 years. The mean heart rate was 73 
      beats per minute (range, 47-110 beats per minute). The mean (SD) best diastole R-R 
      interval was determined as 73 (5) (95% CI, 63-83), and the mean (SD) best systole 
      interval as 38 (5) (95% CI, 28-48). When only best diastole, only best systole, and 
      both best systole and diastole reconstructions were evaluated, all coronary artery 
      segments were visualized in 65 (60%), 61 (56%), and 93 (85%) patients, respectively. 
      In 12 patients' evaluation of additional 1(n = 11) or 2(n = 1), R-R reconstruction 
      intervals allowed visualization of all coronary artery segments. In 4 patients with 
      arrhythmia, all segments cannot be visualized, but after electrocardiographic 
      editing, all segments were visible in 3 of 4 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Automatic 
      determination of best R-R reconstruction interval allows evaluation of all coronary 
      artery segments in most patients (85%) without additional reconstructions. By means 
      of this software, coronary CT angiography studies can be evaluated faster and 
      easier. The most significant limitation of the software is patients with arrhythmia.

TI  - Diagnostic value of automated quantification of nuclear cardiology in Japanese 
      patients with single vessel coronary artery disease: comparison between Japanese and 
      American normal databases.
PG  - 224-9
LID - S0914-5087(13)00134-2 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jjcc.2013.04.001 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Japanese diagnostic assessment of nuclear cardiology has usually 
      been based on semi-quantitative visual analyses but not on automated quantification 
      with a total perfusion deficit (TPD). We, therefore, aimed to determine whether 
      automated TPD quantification is useful to detect coronary artery disease (CAD) in 
      Japanese patients in comparison with conventional visual segmental analysis, and to 
      compare results from the automated assessment between the Japanese and American 
      normal databases (NDBs). METHODS: Patients with suspected CAD underwent rest (201)Tl 
      and stress (99m)Tc-tetrofosmin myocardial perfusion single photon emission computed 
      tomography (SPECT) and coronary angiography within three months. The TPD was 
      automatically derived from the SPECT image through quantitative perfusion SPECT 
      software with the Japanese and American NDBs. The visual summed stress scores (SSS) 
      were estimated with the 5-point visual scoring model for 20 segments of SPECT 
      images. An abnormal criteria for the stress TPD and SSS were defined as ≥ 5% and ≥ 
      4, respectively. RESULTS: Detection sensitivity of CAD was 87% with the stress TPD 
      score derived from the Japanese NDB and 85% with the SSS in visual analysis. In 
      contrast, the detection sensitivity with the stress TPD score derived from the 
      American NDB was 75%, which was significantly lower than that with the Japanese TPD 
      (p=0.0004). Specificity of the automated Japanese TPD assessment was similar to that 
      of the visual SSS assessment (87% vs. 80%). Thus, sensitivity and specificity of the 
      automated quantitative assessment based on the TPD scores derived from the Japanese 
      NDB were consistent with that of visual quantification based on the segmental defect 
      scores. CONCLUSION: The automated quantitative assessment with the Japanese NDB is 
      useful for the detection of CAD when experts in visual interpretation of a 
      myocardial perfusion SPECT image were absent in a clinical setting.

AB  - Implantable cardioverter defibrillators can generate numerous alerts. Automatically 
      classifying these alerts according to their severity hinges on the CHA2DS2VASc 
      score. It requires some reasoning capabilities for interpreting the patient's data. 
      We compared two approaches for implementing the reasoning module. One is based on 
      the Drools engine, and the other is based on semantic web formalisms. Both were 
      valid approaches with correct performances. For a broader domain, their limitations 
      are the number and complexity of Drools rules and the performances of ontology-based 
      reasoning, which suggests using the ontology for automatically generating a part of 
      the Drools rules.

TI  - Detection of strict left bundle branch block by neural network and a method to test 
      detection consistency.
PG  - 025005
LID - 10.1088/1361-6579/ab6e55 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop an automatic algorithm to detect strict left bundle branch 
      block (LBBB) on electrocardiograms (ECG) and propose a procedure to test the 
      consistency of neural network detections. APPROACH: The database for the 
      classification of strict LBBB was provided by Telemetric and Holter ECG Warehouse. 
      It contained 10 s ECGs taken from the MADIT-CRT clinical trial. The database was 
      divided into a training dataset (N  =  300, strict LBBB  =  174, non-strict 
      LBBB  =  126) and a test dataset (N  =  302, strict LBBB  =  156, non-strict 
      LBBB  =  146). LBBB-related features were extracted by Philips DXL(™) algorithm, 
      selected by a random forest classifier, and fed into a 5-layer neural network (NN) 
      for the classification of strict LBBB on the training dataset. The performance of NN 
      on the test dataset was compared to two random forest classifiers, an algorithm 
      applying strict LBBB criteria, a wavelet-based approach, and a 
      support-vector-machine approach. The consistency of NN's detection was tested on 549 
      2 min recordings of the PTB diagnostic ECG database. LBBB annotations are not 
      required to measure consistency. MAIN RESULTS: The performance of NN on the test 
      dataset were sensitivity  =  91. 7%, specificity  =  85.6% and accuracy  =  88.7% 
      (PPV  =  87.2%, NPV  =  90.6%). The consistency score of strict-LBBB and 
      non-strict-LBBB detection was 0.9341 and 0.9973 respectively. CONCLUSION: NN 
      achieved the highest specificity, accuracy, and PPV. Using random forest for feature 
      selection and NN for classification increased interpretability and reduced 
      computational cost. The consistency test showed that NN achieved high consistency 
      scores in the detection of strict LBBB. SIGNIFICANCE: This work proposed an approach 
      for selecting features and training NN for the detection of strict LBBB as well as a 
      consistency test for black-box algorithms.

AB  - Biomedical time series clustering that automatically groups a collection of time 
      series according to their internal similarity is of importance for medical record 
      management and inspection such as bio-signals archiving and retrieval. In this 
      paper, a novel framework that automatically groups a set of unlabelled multichannel 
      biomedical time series according to their internal structural similarity is 
      proposed. Specifically, we treat a multichannel biomedical time series as a document 
      and extract local segments from the time series as words. We extend a topic model, 
      i.e., the Hierarchical probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (H-pLSA), which was 
      originally developed for visual motion analysis to cluster a set of unlabelled 
      multichannel time series. The H-pLSA models each channel of the multichannel time 
      series using a local pLSA in the first layer. The topics learned in the local pLSA 
      are then fed to a global pLSA in the second layer to discover the categories of 
      multichannel time series. Experiments on a dataset extracted from multichannel 
      Electrocardiography (ECG) signals demonstrate that the proposed method performs 
      better than previous state-of-the-art approaches and is relatively robust to the 
      variations of parameters including length of local segments and dictionary size. 
      Although the experimental evaluation used the multichannel ECG signals in a 
      biometric scenario, the proposed algorithm is a universal framework for multichannel 
      biomedical time series clustering according to their structural similarity, which 
      has many applications in biomedical time series management.

TI  - Dense Trajectories and DHOG for Classification of Viewpoints from Echocardiogram

AB  - In echo-cardiac clinical computer-aided diagnosis, an important step is to 
      automatically classify echocardiography videos from different angles and different 
      regions. We propose a kind of echocardiography video classification algorithm based 
      on the dense trajectory and difference histograms of oriented gradients (DHOG). 
      First, we use the dense grid method to describe feature characteristics in each 
      frame of echocardiography sequence and then track these feature points by applying 
      the dense optical flow. In order to overcome the influence of the rapid and 
      irregular movement of echocardiography videos and get more robust tracking results, 
      we also design a trajectory description algorithm which uses the derivative of the 
      optical flow to obtain the motion trajectory information and associates the 
      different characteristics (e.g., the trajectory shape, DHOG, HOF, and MBH) with 
      embedded structural information of the spatiotemporal pyramid. To avoid "dimension 
      disaster," we apply Fisher's vector to reduce the dimension of feature description 
      followed by the SVM linear classifier to improve the final classification result. 
      The average accuracy of echocardiography video classification is 77.12% for all 
      eight viewpoints and 100% for three primary viewpoints.

TI  - Diagnostic Accuracy Of The Electrocardiographic Decision Support - Myocardial 
      Ischaemia (EDS-MI) Algorithm In Detection Of Acute Coronary Occlusion.
PG  - 13-25
LID - 10.1177/2048872618768081 [doi]
AB  - Electrocardiographic Decision Support - Myocardial Ischaemia (EDS-MI) is a graphical 
      decision support for detection and localization of acute transmural ischaemia. A 
      recent study indicated that EDS-MI performs well for detection of acute transmural 
      ischaemia. However, its performance has not been tested in patients with 
      non-ischaemic ST-deviation. We aimed to optimize the diagnostic accuracy of EDS-MI 
      in patients with verified acute coronary occlusion as well as patients with 
      non-ischaemic ST deviation and compare its performance with STEMI criteria. We 
      studied 135 patients with non-ischaemic ST deviation (perimyocarditis, left 
      ventricular hypertrophy, takotsubo cardiomyopathy and early repolarization) and 117 
      patients with acute coronary occlusion. In 63 ischaemic patients, the extent and 
      location of the ischaemic area (myocardium at risk) was assessed by both 
      cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging and EDS-MI. Sensitivity and specificity of 
      ST elevation myocardial infarction criteria were 85% (95% confidence interval (CI) 
      77, 90) and 44% (95% CI 36, 53) respectively. Using EDS-MI, sensitivity and 
      specificity increased to 92% (95% CI 85, 95) and 81% (95% CI 74, 87) respectively 
      (p=0.035 and p<0.001). Agreement was strong (83%) between cardiovascular magnetic 
      resonance imaging and EDS-MI in localization of ischaemia. Mean myocardium at risk 
      was 32% (± 10) by cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging and 33% (± 11) by EDS-MI 
      when the estimated infarcted area according to Selvester QRS scoring was included in 
      myocardium at risk estimation. In conclusion, EDS-MI increases diagnostic accuracy 
      and may serve as an automatic decision support in the early management of patients 
      with suspected acute coronary syndrome. The added clinical benefit in a non-selected 
      clinical chest pain population needs to be assessed.

TI  - 3-D reconstruction of the coronary artery tree from multiple views of a rotational

AB  - To present an efficient and robust method for 3-D reconstruction of the coronary 
      artery tree from multiple ECG-gated views of an X-ray angiography. 2-D coronary 
      artery centerlines are extracted automatically from X-ray projection images using an 
      enhanced multi-scale analysis. For the difficult data with low vessel contrast, a 
      semi-automatic tool based on fast marching method is implemented to allow manual 
      correction of automatically-extracted 2-D centerlines. First, we formulate the 3-D 
      symbolic reconstruction of coronary arteries from multiple views as an energy 
      minimization problem incorporating a soft epipolar line constraint and a smoothness 
      term evaluated in 3-D. The proposed formulation results in the robustness of the 
      reconstruction to the imperfectness in 2-D centerline extraction, as well as the 
      reconstructed coronary artery tree being inherently smooth in 3-D. We further 
      propose to solve the energy minimization problem using α-expansion moves of Graph 
      Cuts, a powerful optimization technique that yields a local minimum in a strong 
      sense at a relatively low computational complexity. We show experimental results on 
      a synthetic coronary phantom, a porcine data set and 11 patient data sets. For the 
      coronary phantom, results obtained using different number of views are presented. 
      3-D reconstruction error evaluated by the mean plus one standard deviation is below 
      one millimeter when 4 or more views are used. For real data, reconstruction using 4 
      to 5 views and 256 depth labels averaged around 12 s on a computer with 2.13 GHz 
      Intel Pentium M and achieves a mean 2-D back-projection error of 1.18 mm (ranging 
      from 0.84 to 1.71 mm) in 12 cases. The accuracy for multi-view reconstruction of the 
      coronary artery tree as reported from the phantom and patient studies is promising, 
      and the efficiency is significantly improved compared to other approaches reported 
      in the literature, which range from a few to tens of minutes. Visually good and 
      smooth reconstruction is demonstrated.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To compare image quality in coronary artery computed tomography 
      angiography (cCTA) using reconstructions with automated phase detection and 
      Reconstructions computed with Identical Filling of the heart (RIF). METHODS: 
      Seventy-four patients underwent ECG-gated dual source CT (DSCT) between November 
      2009 and July 2010 for suspected coronary heart disease (n = 35), planning of 
      transcatheter aortic valve replacement (n = 34) or evaluation of ventricular 
      function (n = 5). Image data sets by the RIF formula and automated phase detection 
      were computed and evaluated with the AHA 15-segment model and a 5-grade Likert scale 
      (1: poor, 5: excellent quality). Subgroups regarding rhythm (sinus rhythm = SR; 
      arrhythmia = ARR) and potential premedication were evaluated by a per-segment, 
      per-vessel and per-patient analysis. RESULTS: RIF significantly improved image 
      quality in 10 of 15 coronary segments (P < 0.05). More diagnostic segments were 
      provided by RIF regarding the entire cohort (n = 693 vs. 590, P < 0.001) and all of 
      the subgroups (e.g. ARR: n = 143 vs. 72, P < 0.001). In arrhythmic patients (n = 
      19), more diagnostic vessels (e.g. LAD: n = 10 vs. 3; P < 0.014) and complete data 
      sets (n = 7 vs. 1; P < 0.001) were produced. CONCLUSIONS: RIF reconstruction is 
      superior to automatic diastolic non-edited reconstructions, especially in arrhythmic 
      patients. RIF theory provides a physiological approach for determining the optimal 
      image reconstruction point in ECG-gated CT angiography. KEY POINTS: Conventional CT 
      coronary angiography suffers from numerous artefacts in patients with irregular 
      rhythms. Coronary computed tomography angiograms (cCTA) were reconstructed with 
      identical cardiac filling (RIF). RIF reconstructions provide improved image quality 
      compared to non-edited standard reconstructions. RIF theory links physiology with 
      cardiac CT.
