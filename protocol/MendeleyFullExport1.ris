N2  - © 2016 The Author(s). Background: Arrhythmia can significantly alter the image quality of cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR); automatic detection and sorting of the most frequent types of arrhythmias during the CMR acquisition could potentially improve image quality. New CMR techniques, such as non-Cartesian CMR, can allow self-gating: from cardiac motion-related signal changes, we can detect cardiac cycles without an electrocardiogram. We can further use this data to obtain a surrogate for RR intervals (valley intervals: VV). Our purpose was to evaluate the feasibility of an automated method for classification of non-arrhythmic (NA) (regular cycles) and arrhythmic patients (A) (irregular cycles), and for sorting of common arrhythmia patterns between atrial fibrillation (AF) and premature ventricular contraction (PVC), using the cardiac motion-related signal obtained during self-gated free-breathing radial cardiac cine CMR with compressed sensing reconstruction (XD-GRASP). Methods: One hundred eleven patients underwent cardiac XD-GRASP CMR between October 2015 and February 2016; 33 were included for retrospective analysis with the proposed method (6 AF, 8 PVC, 19 NA; by recent ECG). We analyzed the VV, using pooled statistics (histograms) and sequential analysis (Poincaré plots), including the median (medVV), the weighted mean (meanVV), the total number of VV values (VVval), and the total range (VVTR) and half range (VVHR) of the cumulative frequency distribution of VV, including the median to half range (medVV/VVHR) and the half range to total range (VVHR/VVTR) ratios. We designed a simple algorithm for using the VV results to differentiate A from NA, and AF from PVC. Results: Between NA and A, meanVV, VVval, VVTR, VVHR, medVV/VVHR and VVHR/VVTR ratios were significantly different (p values = 0.00014, 0.0027, 0.000028, 5×10-9, 0.002, respectively). Between AF and PVC, meanVV, VVval and medVV/VVHR ratio were significantly different (p values = 0.018, 0.007, 0.044, respectively). Using our algorithm, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 93 %, 95 % and 94 % to discriminate between NA and A, and 83 %, 71 %, and 77 % to discriminate between AF and PVC, respectively; areas under the ROC curve were 0.93 and 0.89. Conclusions: Our study shows we can reliably detect arrhythmias and differentiate AF from PVC, using self-gated cardiac cine XD-GRASP CMR.

N2  - © 2016, © The Intensive Care Society 2016. Introduction: Patients in the intensive care unit are vulnerable to myocardial injury from a variety of causes, both ischaemic and non-ischaemic. It is challenging for ICU clinicians to apply the conventional guidance concerning diagnosis and treatment. We conducted this review to examine the evidence concerning diagnosis and treatment of myocardial infarction in the ICU. Methods: A systematic review was performed to identify relevant studies. Results: 19 studies concerning use of ECG, cardiac enzymes, echocardiography and angiography were identified. 4 studies considered treatment of myocardial infarction. Conclusions: Regular 12 lead ECG or 12 lead ECG monitoring is more sensitive than 2 lead monitoring, regular measurement of cardiac enzymes is more sensitive than when provoked by symptoms. Coronary angiography rarely identifies treatable lesions, without regional wall motion abnormality on echocardiography. Evidence relating to treatment was limited. A potential strategy to diagnose myocardial infarctions in the ICU is proposed.

N2  - © 2016 The Author(s). Background: Although premature beats are a matter of concern in horses, the interpretation of equine ECG recordings is complicated by a lack of standardized analysis criteria and a limited knowledge of the normal beat-to-beat variation of equine cardiac rhythm. The purpose of this study was to determine the appropriate threshold levels of maximum acceptable deviation of RR intervals in equine ECG analysis, and to evaluate a novel two-step timing algorithm by quantifying the frequency of arrhythmias in a cohort of healthy adult endurance horses. Results: Beat-to-beat variation differed considerably with heart rate (HR), and an adaptable model consisting of three different HR ranges with separate threshold levels of maximum acceptable RR deviation was consequently defined. For resting HRs <60 beats/min (bpm) the threshold level of RR deviation was set at 20%, for HRs in the intermediate range between 60 and 100 bpm the threshold was 10%, and for exercising HRs >100 bpm, the threshold level was 4%. Supraventricular premature beats represented the most prevalent arrhythmia category with varying frequencies in seven horses at rest (median 7, range 2-86) and six horses during exercise (median 2, range 1-24). Conclusions: Beat-to-beat variation of equine cardiac rhythm varies according to HR, and threshold levels in equine ECG analysis should be adjusted accordingly. Standardization of the analysis criteria will enable comparisons of studies and follow-up examinations of patients. A small number of supraventricular premature beats appears to be a normal finding in endurance horses. Further studies are required to validate the findings and determine the clinical significance of premature beats in horses.

N2  - © 2016 IEEE. Alarm fatigue in intensive care units (ICU) is one of the top healthcare issues in the US. False alarms in ICU will decrease the quality of care and staff response time over the alarms. Normally, false alarm will cause desensitization of the clinical staff which leads to warnings and misleading, if the triggered alarm is true. In this study, we have proposed a multi-model ensemble approach to reduce the false alarm rate in monitoring systems. We have used 750 patient records from PhysioNet database. At First arrhythmia based features from electrocardiogram (ECG), arterial blood pressure (ABP) and photoplethysmogram (PPG) features were extracted from the records. Next, the dataset has been separated into two subsets on the basis of available features information. The first dataset (DS1) is the combination of ECG physiological, ABP and PPG features. Their correlation coefficient and p-values criteria have been applied for relevant alarm-wise feature-set selection, and random forest classifier was used for model development and validation. The threshold based approach was used on second dataset (DS2) which is the combination of arrhythmia, ABP and PPG features. The developed ensemble model is able to achieve sensitivity 83.33-100 % (average 95.56 %) being true alarms and suppress false alarms rate 66.67-89% (average 77.25%). The predictability of classifier shows the advantage to deal with unbalanced set of information, therefore overall model performance has reached to 83.96% accuracy.

N2  - Continuous monitoring of critical patients and their biological parameters are transmitted to doctor's console, and doctor's domain address in person using Internet of Things technology (IoT). The design involves measurement of all critical parameters of patients using sensors. Vital parameters measured are temperature, respiration, and pulse rate, humidity and oxygen saturation level using dht11 sensor, MQ sensor, pulse sensor and pulse oximeter sensor. The input sensors are interfaced with an Arduino board and then the signals are transferred to the Raspberry Pi controller and the vital parameters are transmitted to the centralized monitor, where the front end is designed using Lab VIEW software. Using IoT, physicians are notified about the sudden change in patient's condition. The graphical representation of the patient's data is displayed in the doctor's console using Lab VIEW, and the critical readings of the patient are sent to the doctor's domain address through IoT. Thus, critical patients can be monitored by the doctors from wherever they are, enabling more care and attention towards the patient's health by the doctor.

N2  - © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG. A myriad of data is produced in intensive care units (ICU) even for short periods of time. This data is frequently used for monitoring patient’s immediate health status, not for real-time analysis because of technical challenges in real-time processing of such massive data. Data storage is also another challenge in making ICU data useful for retrospective studies. Therefore, it is important to know the minimal sampling frequency requirement to develop real-time analysis on ICU data and to develop a data storage plan. In this study, we have applied the Probabilistic Symbolic Pattern Recognition (PSPR) method in Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation (PAF) screening problem by analyzing electrocardiogram signals at different sampling frequencies varying from 128 Hz to 8 Hz. Our results show that using PSPR method, we can obtain a classification accuracy of 82.67% in identifying PAF subjects even when the test data is sampled at 8 Hz frequency (73.33% for 128 Hz). This classification accuracy drastically improved to 92% when other descriptive features were used along with PSPR features. The PSPR’s PAF screening ability at low sampling frequency indicates its potential for real-time analysis and wearable embedded computing applications.

Aims Screening for atrial fibrillation (AF) using intermittent electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings can identify individuals at risk of AF-related morbidity in particular stroke. We aimed to validate the performance of an AF screening algorithm compared with manual ECG analysis by specially trained nurses and physicians (gold standard) in 30 s intermittent one-lead ECG recordings. Methods and results The STROKESTOP study is a mass-screening study for AF using intermittent ECG recordings. All individuals in the study without known AF registered a 30-s ECG recording in Lead I two times daily for 2 weeks, and all ECGs were manually interpreted. A computerized algorithm was used to analyse 80 149 ECG recordings in 3209 individuals. The computerized algorithm annotated 87.1% (n = 69 789) of the recordings as sinus rhythm/minor rhythm disturbances. The manual interpretation (gold standard) was that 69 758 ECGs were normal, making the negative predictive value of the algorithm 99.9%. The number of ECGs requiring manual interpretation in order to find one pathological ECG was reduced from 288 to 35. Atrial fibrillation was diagnosed in 84 patients by manual interpretation, in all of whom the algorithm indicated pathology. On an ECG level, 278 ECGs were manually interpreted as AF, and of these the algorithm annotated 272 ECGs as pathological (sensitivity 97.8%). Conclusion Automatic ECG screening using a computerized algorithm safely identifies normal ECGs in Lead I and reduces the need for manual evaluation of individual ECGs with >85% with 100% sensitivity on an individual basis.

N2  - © 2016, The Author(s). Background: Hemodynamic instability is frequent and outcome-relevant in critical illness. The understanding of complex hemodynamic disturbances and their monitoring and management plays an important role in treatment of intensive care patients. An increasing number of treatment recommendations and guidelines in intensive care medicine emphasize hemodynamic goals, which go beyond the measurement of blood pressures. Yet, it is not known to which extent the infrastructural prerequisites for extended hemodynamic monitoring are given in intensive care units (ICUs) and how hemodynamic management is performed in clinical practice. Further, it is still unclear which factors trigger the use of extended hemodynamic monitoring. Methods: In this multicenter, 1-day (November 7, 2013, and the preceding 24 h) cross-sectional study, we retrieved data on patient monitoring from ICUs in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland by means of a web-based case report form. One hundred and sixty-one intensive care units contributed detailed information on availability of hemodynamic monitoring. In addition, detailed information on hemodynamic monitoring of 1789 patients that were treated on due date was collected, and independent factors triggering the use of extended hemodynamic monitoring were identified by multivariate analysis. Results: Besides basic monitoring with electrocardiography (ECG), pulse oximetry, and blood pressure monitoring, the majority of patients received invasive arterial (77.9 %) and central venous catheterization (55.2 %). All over, additional extended hemodynamic monitoring for assessment of cardiac output was only performed in 12.3 % of patients, while echocardiographic examination was used in only 1.9 %. The strongest independent predictors for the use of extended hemodynamic monitoring of any kind were mechanical ventilation, the need for catecholamine therapy, and treatment backed by protocols. In 71.6 % of patients in whom extended hemodynamic monitoring was added during the study period, this extension led to changes in treatment. Conclusions: Extended hemodynamic monitoring, which goes beyond the measurement of blood pressures, to date plays a minor role in the surveillance of critically ill patients in German, Austrian, and Swiss ICUs. This includes also consensus-based recommended diagnostic and monitoring applications, such as echocardiography and cardiac output monitoring. Mechanical ventilation, the use of catecholamines, and treatment backed by protocol could be identified as factors independently associated with higher use of extended hemodynamic monitoring.

N2  - © 2017 IEEE Computer Society. All rights reserved. Generally in hospitals, intensive care units (ICUs) have high rates of false arrhythmia alarms independent of their brands and prices. These falsely issued alarms disrupt patients rest, drain hospital resources, and desensitize the hospital staff to potential emergency situations, which is named as false alarm fatigue. It has been estimated that 43% of life threatening electrocardiogram (ECG) alarms issued by bedside monitors are false, with some categories of alarm being as high as 90%. In our study, we consider the alarms triggered by four life threatening conditions. These alarms are usually triggered by ECG and pulsatile waveforms recorded by monitoring equipment, which have standard alarm triggering criteria such as instantaneous thresholds on the predictor values. Most of the ICU false alarms are caused by single channel artifacts. In this study, we aim to fuse ECG features with information from other independent signals and get more robust alarm algorithms for ICUs. Pulsatile waveforms, which are highly correlated signals, can be used to corroborate the alarm category and to suppress significant number of false ECG alarms in ICUs. Photoplethysmogram (PPG), arterial blood pressure (ABP) or both PPG and ABP can be used for this purpose. These waveformsare the least noisy pressure signal available in certain ICUs and rarely contain ECG-related artifacts. We implement four different algorithms that use information from ECG, PPG and ABP waveforms, and compare the results.

The need for pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) admission, length of hospital stay pre and post discharge imaging, duration of activity restriction varies from country to country and center to centre. The purpose of this study was to characterize the pattern of practice in a developing state health institution and formulate safe and effective care plan for managing children with isolated blunt splenic injuries. Method: A retrospective study between 2009-2015 with isolated blunt splenic trauma at our hospital in paediatric population. Result: A total of 40 children (30 male and 10 female) with isolated blunt trauma spleen were included in this study. Age group was between 2.5–16 years (mean 9.5 ± 0.17 years). Fifteen patients were hemodynamically unstable and were resuscitated at reception. Average grade of splenic injury was 2.9. All the patients were admitted in general ward and attached to monitor with heart rate (HR), respiratory rate(RR),electrocardiogram (ECG), blood pressure (B.P) and oxygen saturation (SPO2) monitoring. Average length of hospital stay was 5.5 days (Range 3-11 days). Initial imaging was Ultrasonography (USG) and contrast enhanced computed tomography (CECT) in 18 patients and CECT abdomen only 22 patients. Follow-up imaging was done with USG only in 10 patients (25%) before discharge. Mean observed activity restriction in our study was 5 weeks range (4-8 weeks). All the 40 patients had successful non-operative management without any death or complication. Conclusion; Non-operative management of isolated blunt splenic trauma in paediatric patients was 100% successful in our study. Routine pre-discharge imaging may not be necessary and admission to paediatric ICU might not be mandatory, provided strict hemodynamic monitoring is done. In most isolated splenic injuries 6 weeks activity restriction is safe.

The purpose of this research is to localize ECG electrodes from a 3D photo and to reduce electrode misplacement related errors in the ECG interpretation. A Kinect camera is used to take a 3D photo, which is registered automatically to a model derived from MRI/CT(MC). The registration algorithms use a sternum marker attached to the skin to enable an accurate and fast matching of the 3D photo and the MC model. The algorithms have been compared to optimal manual registration. For all cases the automatic registration algorithms performed much better than the manual registration. The automatic registration of a 3D photo with patient specific electrode positions will offer a novel way of preventing and correcting errors due to ECG lead misplacement.

N2  - © 2017 IEEE. T-wave amplitude (TWA) has been proposed as a marker of the innervation of the myocardium. Until now, TWA has been calculated manually or with poor algorithms, thus making its use not efficient in a clinical environment. We introduce a new wavelet-based algorithm for the delineation QRS complexes and T-waves, and the automatic calculation of TWA. When validated in the MIT/BIH Arrhythmia database, the QRS detector achieved sensitivity and positive predictive value of 99.84% and 99.87%, respectively. The algorithm was validated also on the QT database and it achieved sensitivity of 99.50% for T-peak detection. In addition, the algorithm achieved delineation accuracy that is similar to the differences in delineation between expert cardiologists. We applied the algorithm for the evaluation of the influence in TWA of anticholinergic and antiadrenergic drugs (i.e., atropine and metoprolol) for healthy subjects. We found that the TWA decreased significantly with atropine and that metoprolol caused a significant increase in TWA, thus confirming the clinical hypothesis that the TWA is a marker of the innervation of the myocardium. The results of this paper show that the proposed algorithm can be used as a useful and efficient tool in clinical practice for the automatic calculation of TWA and its interpretation as a non-invasive marker of the autonomic ventricular innervation.

The pulse contour cardiac output monitor (PiCCO) is one of them. Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate our practice of hemodynamic monitoring with PiCCO in the perioperative period. Methods: A retrospective descriptive analysis was performed in a single general surgical intensive care unit (ICU) run by anesthesiologists for the years 2013-2016. We collected information about patients, ICU quality parameters and monitoring equipment available in the ICU. The primary endpoint was the incidence of PiCCO use. Results: Out of 2972 patients admitted to the general surgical ICU in a 4-year period, besides basic monitoring with electrocardiography (ECG), pulse oximetry and blood pressure monitoring, more than half of the patients received central venous catheterization (55.1%), less than the half invasive arterial catheterization (44.1 %) and only a small proportion PiCCO (0.91%). No patient received a pulmonary arterial catheter. Mortality rate was 7.47 %. Conclusion: The use of PiCCO in our ICU is far below reported in literature. In the majority of cases, our anesthesiologists make clinical decisions based on measurement of central venous and invasive arterial pressure.

N2  - © 2017 Elsevier Ltd Accurate automatic identification of fiducial points within an ECG is required for the automatic interpretation of this signal. Several methods exist in the literature for automatic ECG segmentation. These algorithms are based on different methodologies and often evaluated with different datasets and protocols, which makes their performance challenging to compare. For this study, nine segmentation algorithms were selected from the literature and evaluated with the same protocol in order to study their performance. One hundred signals from the PhysioNet's QT database were used for this evaluation. Results showed that one of the algorithms based in the discrete wavelet transform achieved sensitivity of 100% when detecting the onset and offset of the QRS complex. An algorithm using the Multi-scale Morphological Derivate achieved sensitivities of 99.81%, 98.17% and 99.56% when detecting the peak, onset and offset respectively of the P-wave. When segmenting the T-wave, an algorithm based on the Phasor transform had a good performance with sensitivities of 97.78%, 97.81% and 95.43% when detecting the peak, onset and offset, respectively. Additionally, probabilistic methods such as Hidden Markov Models had good results due to the fact that they can learn from real signals and adapt to specific conditions. However, these techniques are often computationally more complex and require training. This study could help in selecting optimal algorithms for ECG segmentation when implementing a system for automatic ECG interpretation.

N2  - © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd Background and objective The first-order high-pass filter (AC coupling) has previously been shown to affect the ECG for higher cut-off frequencies. We seek to find a systematic deviation in computer measurements of the electrocardiogram when the AC coupling with a 0.05'Hz first-order high-pass filter is used. Methods The standard 12-lead electrocardiogram from 1248 patients and the automated measurements of their DC and AC coupled version were used. We expect a large unipolar QRS-complex to produce a deviation in the opposite direction in the ST-segment. Results We found a strong correlation between the QRS integral and the offset throughout the ST-segment. The coefficient for J amplitude deviation was found to be −0.277'µV/(µV⋅s). Conclusions Potential dangerous alterations to the diagnostically important ST-segment were found. Medical professionals and software developers for electrocardiogram interpretation programs should be aware of such high-pass filter effects since they could be misinterpreted as pathophysiology or some pathophysiology could be masked by these effects.

N2  - Copyright 2017, ISA All Rights Reserved. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia affecting approximately 3 million Americans, and is a prognostic marker for stroke, heart failure and even death. 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) is used to monitor normal sinus rhythm (NSR) and also detect AF in ICU and ambulatory patients. Current techniques to discriminate NSR and AF from single lead ECG suffer several limitations in terms of sensitivity and specificity using short time ECG data which distorts ECG and many are not suitable for real-time implementation. There is a clear need for more robust detection and classification algorithms for clinical applications and specifically for delivering appropriate therapy for implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICD) to provide lifesaving timely action. In this work, the authors propose and demonstrate the application of a multiscale frequency (MSF) technique which takes into account the contribution from various frequencies in ECG and thus yield valuable information regarding the chaotic nature of AF. In this work the authors used AF (25 ECG samples) and NSR (25 ECG samples) traces from publically available Atrial Fibrillation Physionet database for accurate discrimination using MSF approach. The results demonstrate that MSF index is significantly higher (p<0.01) in AF compared to NSR thus enabling robust discrimination. These results offer huge promise for clinical diagnosis of AF from single lead ECG enabling novel treatment strategies in a quick and effective fashion especially in ICD’s as well as for routine monitoring of ambulatory patients. The results also motivate the use of this technique for analysis of other cardiac arrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF).

N2  - © 2016 Society for Psychophysiological Research The electrocardiogram (ECG) signal has been widely used to study the physiological substrates of emotion. However, searching for better filtering techniques in order to obtain a signal with better quality and with the maximum relevant information remains an important issue for researchers in this field. Signal processing is largely performed for ECG analysis and interpretation, but this process can be susceptible to error in the delineation phase. In addition, it can lead to the loss of important information that is usually considered as noise and, consequently, discarded from the analysis. The goal of this study was to evaluate if the ECG noise allows for the classification of emotions, while using its entropy as an input in a decision tree classifier. We collected the ECG signal from 25 healthy participants while they were presented with videos eliciting negative (fear and disgust) and neutral emotions. The results indicated that the neutral condition showed a perfect identification (100%), whereas the classification of negative emotions indicated good identification performances (60% of sensitivity and 80% of specificity). These results suggest that the entropy of noise contains relevant information that can be useful to improve the analysis of the physiological correlates of emotion.

N2  - © 2017 Harris et al. Introduction: A high rate of false arrhythmia alarms in the intensive care unit (ICU) leads to alarm fatigue, the condition of desensitization and potentially inappropriate silencing of alarms due to frequent invalid and nonactionable alarms, often referred to as false alarms. Objective: The aim of this study was to identify patient characteristics, such as gender, age, body mass index, and diagnosis associated with frequent false arrhythmia alarms in the ICU. Methods: This descriptive, observational study prospectively enrolled patients who were consecutively admitted to one of five adult ICUs (77 beds) at an urban medical center over a period of 31 days in 2013. All monitor alarms and continuous waveforms were stored on a secure server. Nurse scientists with expertise in cardiac monitoring used a standardized protocol to annotate six clinically important types of arrhythmia alarms (asystole, pause, ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, accelerated ventricular rhythm, and ventricular bradycardia) as true or false. Total monitoring time for each patient was measured, and the number of false alarms per hour was calculated for these six alarm types. Medical records were examined to acquire data on patient characteristics. Results: A total of 461 unique patients (mean age =60±17 years) were enrolled, generating a total of 2,558,760 alarms, including all levels of arrhythmia, parameter, and technical alarms. There were 48,404 hours of patient monitoring time, and an average overall alarm rate of 52 alarms/hour. Investigators annotated 12,671 arrhythmia alarms; 11,345 (89.5%) were determined to be false. Two hundred and fifty patients (54%) generated at least one of the six annotated alarm types. Two patients generated 6,940 arrhythmia alarms (55%). The number of false alarms per monitored hour for patients’ annotated arrhythmia alarms ranged from 0.0 to 7.7, and the duration of these false alarms per hour ranged from 0.0 to 158.8 seconds. Patient characteristics were compared in relation to 1) the number and 2) the duration of false arrhythmia alarms per 24-hour period, using nonparametric statistics to minimize the influence of outliers. Among the significant associations were the following: age ≥60 years (P=0.013; P=0.034), confused mental status (P<0.001 for both comparisons), cardiovascular diagnoses (P<0.001 for both comparisons), electrocardiographic (ECG) features, such as wide ECG waveforms that correspond to ventricular depolarization known as QRS complex due to bundle branch block (BBB) (P=0.003; P=0.004) or ventricular paced rhythm (P=0.002 for both comparisons), respiratory diagnoses (P=0.004 for both comparisons), and support with mechanical ventilation, including those with primary diagnoses other than respiratory ones (P<0.001 for both comparisons). Conclusion: Patients likely to trigger a higher number of false arrhythmia alarms may be those with older age, confusion, cardiovascular diagnoses, and ECG features that indicate BBB or ventricular pacing, respiratory diagnoses, and mechanical ventilatory support. Algorithm improvements could focus on better noise reduction (eg, motion artifact with confused state) and distinguishing BBB and paced rhythms from ventricular arrhythmias. Increasing awareness of patient conditions that apparently trigger a higher rate of false arrhythmia alarms may be useful for reducing unnecessary noise and improving alarm management.

N2  - © 2017 The Author(s). Background: The Electrocardiogram ECG is one of the most important non-invasive tools for cardiac diseases diagnosis. Taking advantage of the developed telecommunication infrastructure, several approaches that address the development of telemetry cardiac devices were introduced recently. Telemetry ECG devices allow easy and fast ECG monitoring of patients with suspected cardiac issues. Choosing the right device with the desired working mode, signal quality, and the device cost are still the main obstacles to massive usage of these devices. Methods: In this paper, we introduce design, implementation, and validation of a multi-purpose telemetry system for recording, transmission, and interpretation of ECG signals in different recording modes. The system consists of an ECG device, a cloud-based analysis pipeline, and accompanied mobile applications for physicians and patients. The proposed ECG device's mechanical design allows laypersons to easily record post-event short-term ECG signals, using dry electrodes without any preparation. Moreover, patients can use the device to record long-term signals in loop and holter modes, using wet electrodes. In order to overcome the problem of signal quality fluctuation due to using different electrodes types and different placements on subject's chest, customized ECG signal processing and interpretation pipeline is presented for each working mode. Results: We present the evaluation of the novel short-term recorder design. Recording of an ECG signal was performed for 391 patients using a standard 12-leads golden standard ECG and the proposed patient-activated short-term post-event recorder. In the validation phase, a sample of validation signals followed peer review process wherein two experts annotated the signals in terms of signal acceptability for diagnosis.We found that 96% of signals allow detecting arrhythmia and other signal's abnormal changes. Additionally, we compared and presented the correlation coefficient and the automatic QRS delineation results of both short-term post-event recorder and 12-leads golden standard ECG recorder. Conclusions: The proposed multi-purpose ECG device allows physicians to choose the working mode of the same device according to the patient status. The proposed device was designed to allow patients to manage the technical requirements of both working modes. Post-event short-term ECG recording using the proposed design provide physicians reliable three ECG leads with direct symptom-rhythm correlation.

N2  - © 2017 Bentham Science Publishers. Background: The most common acquired cause of Long QT syndrome (LQTS) is drug induced QT interval prolongation. It is an electrophysiological entity, which is characterized by an extended duration of the ventricular repolarization. Reflected as a prolonged QT interval in a surface ECG, this syndrome increases the risk for polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (Torsade de Pointes) and sudden death. Method: Bibliographic databases as MEDLINE and EMBASE, reports and drug alerts from several regulatory agencies (FDA, EMEA, ANMAT) and drug safety guides (ICH S7B, ICH E14) were consulted to prepare this article. The keywords used were: polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, adverse drug events, prolonged QT, arrhythmias, intensive care unit and Torsade de Pointes. Such research involved materials produced up to December 2017. Results: Because of their mechanism of action, antiarrhythmic drugs such as amiodarone, sotalol, quinidine, procainamide, verapamil and diltiazem are associated to the prolongation of the QTc interval. For this reason, they require constant monitoring when administered. Other noncardiovascular drugs that are widely used in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), such as ondansetron, macrolide and fluoroquinolone antibiotics, typical and atypical antipsychotics agents such as haloperidol, thioridazine, and sertindole are also frequently associated with the prolongation of the QTc interval. As a consequence, critical patients should be closely followed and evaluated. Conclusion: ICU patients are particularly prone to experience a QTc interval prolongation mainly for two reasons. In the first place, they are exposed to certain drugs that can prolong the repolarization phase, either by their mechanism of action or through the interaction with other drugs. In the second place, the risk factors for TdP are prevalent clinical conditions among critically ill patients. As a consequence, the attending physician is expected to perform preventive monitoring and ECG checks to control the QTc interval.

N2  - © 2017 World Scientific Publishing Company. In view of requirements of low-resource consumption and high-efficiency in real-time Ambulatory Electrocardiograph Diagnosis (AED) applications, a novel Cardiac Arrhythmias Detection (CAD) algorithm is proposed. This algorithm consists of three core modules: an automatic-learning machine that models diagnostic criteria and grades the emergency events of cardiac arrhythmias by studying morphological characteristics of ECG signals and experiential knowledge of cardiologists; a rhythm classifier that recognizes and classifies heart rhythms basing on statistical features comparison and linear discriminant with confidence interval estimation; and an arrhythmias interpreter that assesses emergency events of cardia arrhythmias basing on a two rule-relative interpretation mechanisms. The experiential results on off-line MIT-BIH cardiac arrhythmia database as well as online clinical testing explore that this algorithm has 92.8% sensitivity and 97.5% specificity in average, so that it is suitable for real-time cardiac arrhythmias monitoring.

This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited. Background: Charted vital signs and laboratory results represent intermittent samples of a patient’s dynamic physiologic state and have been used to calculate early warning scores to identify patients at risk of clinical deterioration. We hypothesized that the addition of cardiorespiratory dynamics measured from continuous electrocardiography (ECG) monitoring to intermittently sampled data improves the predictive validity of models trained to detect clinical deterioration prior to intensive care unit (ICU) transfer or unanticipated death. Methods and findings: We analyzed 63 patient-years of ECG data from 8,105 acute care patient admissions at a tertiary care academic medical center. We developed models to predict deterioration resulting in ICU transfer or unanticipated death within the next 24 hours using either vital signs, laboratory results, or cardiorespiratory dynamics from continuous ECG monitoring and also evaluated models using all available data sources. We calculated the predictive validity (C-statistic), the net reclassification improvement, and the probability of achieving the difference in likelihood ratio χ2 for the additional degrees of freedom. The primary outcome occurred 755 times in 586 admissions (7%). We analyzed 395 clinical deteriorations with continuous ECG data in the 24 hours prior to an event. Using only continuous ECG measures resulted in a C-statistic of 0.65, similar to models using only laboratory results and vital signs (0.63 and 0.69 respectively). Addition of continuous ECG measures to models using conventional measurements improved the C-statistic by 0.01 and 0.07; a model integrating all data sources had a C-statistic of 0.73 with categorical net reclassification improvement of 0.09 for a change of 1 decile in risk. The difference in likelihood ratio χ2 between integrated models with and without cardiorespiratory dynamics was 2158 (p value: <0.001). Conclusions: Cardiorespiratory dynamics from continuous ECG monitoring detect clinical deterioration in acute care patients and improve performance of conventional models that use only laboratory results and vital signs.

N2  - © 2016 TSI® Press. Electrocardiogram (ECG) is a well-known diagnostic tool, which is applied by cardiologists to diagnose cardiac disorders. Despite the simple shape of the ECG, various informative measures are included in each recording, which causes complexity for cardiac specialists to recognize the heart problem. Recent studies have concentrated on designing automatic decision-making systems to assist physicians in ECG interpretation and detecting the disorders using ECG signals. This paper applies one optimization algorithm known as Kinetic Gas Molecule Optimization (KGMO) that is based on swarm behavior of gas molecules to train a feedforward neural network for classification of ECG signals. Five types of ECG signals are used in this work including normal, supraventricular, brunch bundle block, anterior myocardial infarction (Anterior MI), and interior myocardial infarction (Interior MI). The classification performance of the proposed KGMO neural network (KGMONN) was evaluated on the Physiobank database and compared against conventional algorithms. The obtained results show the proposed neural network outperformed the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and back propagation (BP) neural networks, with the accuracy of 0.85 and a Mean Square Error (MSE) of less than 20% for the training and test sets. The swarm based KGMONN provides a successful approach for detection of heart disorders with efficient performance.

N2  - © 2017 IEEE. Generally in hospitals, intensive care units (ICUs) have high rates of false arrhythmia alarms independent of their brands and prices. These falsely issued alarms disrupt patients' rest, drain hospital resources, and desensitize the hospital staff to potential emergency situations, which is named as 'false alarm fatigue'. It has been estimated that 43% of life threatening electrocardiogram (ECG) alarms issued by bedside monitors are false, with some categories of alarm being as high as 90%. In our study, we consider the alarms triggered by four life threatening conditions. These alarms are usually triggered by ECG and pulsatile waveforms recorded by monitoring equipment, which have standard alarm triggering criteria such as instantaneous thresholds on the predictor values. Most of the ICU false alarms are caused by single channel artifacts. In this study, we aim to fuse ECG features with information from other independent signals and get more robust alarm algorithms for ICUs. Pulsatile waveforms, which are highly correlated signals, can be used to corroborate the alarm category and to suppress significant number of false ECG alarms in ICUs. Photoplethysmogram (PPG), arterial blood pressure (ABP) or both PPG and ABP can be used for this purpose. These waveformsare the least noisy pressure signal available in certain ICUs and rarely contain ECG-related artifacts. We implement four different algorithms that use information from ECG, PPG and ABP waveforms, and compare the results.

N2  - © 2017 IEEE. Telehealthcare has become increasingly popular in clinical practice as a means of providing ubiquitous healthcare through long-term informative interactions and health monitoring. We have delivered a synchronized telehealthcare program since 2009. We have implemented a web-based clinical decision support system with a knowledge-based electrocardiogram (ECG) recognition mechanism as an augmentation service to assist medical practitioners doing decision making in clinical practice. To evaluate the capability and usage limits of this automatic ECG interpretation, the aim of this study was to validate the stability and robustness of proposed mechanism using stress testing through six simulation scenarios. According to experimental results, both of the processing items and processing time augmented steadily by the resource of hardware. Besides, under the cross-validation using 327,058 ECG signals from our telehealthcare program, the recognition classifiers yielded 86.8% accuracy in sinus detection and 88.4% accuracy in atrial fibrillation detection. In the future, this prominent mechanism of automatic ECG interpretation could widely offer high accessibility in the field of medical service. The findings of the present study also encourage and augment further support to implementation of screening and monitoring as part of telehealthcare.

N2  - © 2017 Elsevier Inc. Background The 12-lead Electrocardiogram (ECG) has been used to detect cardiac abnormalities in the same format for more than 70 years. However, due to the complex nature of 12-lead ECG interpretation, there is a significant cognitive workload required from the interpreter. This complexity in ECG interpretation often leads to errors in diagnosis and subsequent treatment. We have previously reported on the development of an ECG interpretation support system designed to augment the human interpretation process. This computerised decision support system has been named ‘Interactive Progressive based Interpretation’ (IPI). In this study, a decision support algorithm was built into the IPI system to suggest potential diagnoses based on the interpreter's annotations of the 12-lead ECG. We hypothesise semi-automatic interpretation using a digital assistant can be an optimal man-machine model for ECG interpretation. Objectives To improve interpretation accuracy and reduce missed co-abnormalities. Methods The Differential Diagnoses Algorithm (DDA) was developed using web technologies where diagnostic ECG criteria are defined in an open storage format, Javascript Object Notation (JSON), which is queried using a rule-based reasoning algorithm to suggest diagnoses. To test our hypothesis, a counterbalanced trial was designed where subjects interpreted ECGs using the conventional approach and using the IPI + DDA approach. Results A total of 375 interpretations were collected. The IPI + DDA approach was shown to improve diagnostic accuracy by 8.7% (although not statistically significant, p-value = 0.1852), the IPI + DDA suggested the correct interpretation more often than the human interpreter in 7/10 cases (varying statistical significance). Human interpretation accuracy increased to 70% when seven suggestions were generated. Conclusion Although results were not found to be statistically significant, we found; 1) our decision support tool increased the number of correct interpretations, 2) the DDA algorithm suggested the correct interpretation more often than humans, and 3) as many as 7 computerised diagnostic suggestions augmented human decision making in ECG interpretation. Statistical significance may be achieved by expanding sample size.

Methods: A retrospective analysis of anonymized cardio screening results of 22,433 adult residents of 565 settlements (cities and villages) across all 20 administrative districts of the Khmelnytskyi Region (Ukraine) was conducted to find a statistically significant connection between individual heart rate variability parameters and the age of people. Results: Primary statistical analysis and visualization showed a correlation between the selected heart rate variability parameters and the age and sex of the examined persons. The study found values of the predicted age slightly over estimation versus the actual age for very young test subjects and below estimation for elderly subjects. Conclusion: The use of neural network computations and the modification of the algorithm through the construction of individual training samples for different age intervals, and the creation of individual ensembles of classification neural networks, therefore achieved a prediction of the age of examined persons based on the values of their time and frequency domain heart rate variability indices, with 87% accuracy for women and 85% accuracy for men in the 66–85 years age interval and at least 85% for age groups across the entire sample.

Resting ECG was recorded and later analyzed by an HFQRS algorithm. Results were compared to the conventional ECG diagnosis by 3 independent interpretations: treating physician, expert cardiologist and an automated computer program. Results The HFQRS analysis demonstrated improved sensitivity (67.5%) for the NSTE-ACS group compared to the human interpreters (59.7% and 53.2% for the treating physician and cardiologist respectively) with similar specificity. The automatic program had significantly lower sensitivity (31%) with a higher specificity (77%). Conclusions HFQRS which has shown great promise in diagnosing stable CAD may also be helpful in the ED for diagnosing ACS.

Objective: This paper aims to prove that automatic beat classification on ECG signals can be effectively solved with a pure knowledge-based approach, using an appropriate set of abstract features obtained from the interpretation of the physiological processes underlying the signal. Methods: A set of qualitative morphological and rhythm features are obtained for each heartbeat as a result of the abductive interpretation of the ECG. Then, a QRS clustering algorithm is applied in order to reduce the effect of possible errors in the interpretation. Finally, a rule-based classifier assigns a tag to each cluster. Results: The method has been tested with the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database records, showing a significantly better performance than any other automatic approach in the state-of-the-art, and even improving most of the assisted approaches that require the intervention of an expert in the process. Conclusion: The most relevant issues in ECG classification, related to a large extent to the variability of the signal patterns between different subjects and even in the same subject over time, will be overcome by changing the reasoning paradigm. Significance: This paper demonstrates the power of an abductive framework for time-series interpretation to make a qualitative leap in the significance of the information extracted from the ECG by automatic methods.

There has been requirement to evolve a general parallel architecture for concurrently processing Electrocardiogram (ECG) using Wavelet Transform based DSP algorithms. In order to acquire spatial ECG electrical signals, 12 ECG lead channels need to be digitized and concurrently processed by Wavelet Transforms, simultaneously acquiring from all the 12 leads. More over now a day 15 Channel ECG is also under consideration in research, for on-line monitoring of critical patient in an ICU situation, while assessing or monitoring load on heart, during treatment process. In this wavelet transform algorithms, matrix inverse operations using wavelet bases matrix, requiring simultaneous matrix multiplications are involved. In order not to loose, high frequency components of ECG, for signal perception or deviation detection using wavelets, the ECG beat is segmented into 410 cubic splines at 2048bps sample rate, to explore association of ECG deviations to different heart ailments. Each spline has associated wavelet coefficient matrix, computed using bases matrix and incoming Digitized ECG vector matrix. On each of the12 lead ECG channels, there are 410 matrix operations required per channel per beat. These matrix operations are required simultaneously, on all the 12 lead ECG Channels, for concurrent digital signal processing of channels for deviation detection. In this processing, multiple data has to be processed by single instruction or algorithm statement, which leads to SIMD (Signal Instruction Multiple Data) architecture. So, a parallel architecture with 16 Processing Elements (PE) with array multipliers for matrix operations are evolved in this review article for suggesting a general parallel architecture for ECG Wavelet Analysis for Signal Perception and Deviation Detection. Using this general parallel architecture, several Wavelet Transform based algorithms, for signal perception for deviation detection are possible, for associating ECG deviations to different heart ailments and localize the deviation to mechanical functional deviation of the hearts anatomy or muscle for on-line diagnostic purpose. So a complete architecture is evolved for such parallel processing, searching the architectural research space and suggested architecture, illustrating brief part of an algorithm.

N2  - © 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. ECG is one of the important physiological parameters and is required for monitoring and diagnosis of common cardiac patients. Nowadays, it is an integrated part of generalized monitoring system in ICU and other critical care units. With the development of sophisticated instrumentation systems and modern signal processing technologies, the monitoring and automation in analysis of acquired data makes clinical decision faster and more reliable. The present article discusses the conventional ECG monitoring methodology and recent technologies used for signal acquisition and processing for ECG analysis. As the signal strength (amplitude, frequency, etc.) is feeble in biosignals like ECG, proper data acquisition hardware should be designed for capturing and further processing for information extraction. With the development of computerized automatic signal processing technologies, it becomes easier to develop a biosignal processing and interpretation system. In this article, the application of modern signal processing tools for electrocardiogram (ECG) signal analysis for classification and detection of rhythmic abnormalities is also discussed. For completeness, basics of the heart and generation and interpretation of ECG are also included along with the present trends toward wireless ECG monitoring and few specialized ECG monitoring applications.

N2  - © 1964-2012 IEEE. Objective: We developed an image-based electrocardiographic (ECG) quality assessment technique that mimics how clinicians annotate ECG signal quality. Methods: We adopted the structural similarity measure (SSIM) to compare images of two ECG records that are obtained from displaying ECGs in a standard scale. Then, a subset of representative ECG images from the training set was selected as templates through a clustering method. SSIM between each image and all the templates were used as the feature vector for the linear discriminant analysis classifier. We also employed three commonly used ECG signal quality index (SQI) measures: baseSQI, kSQI, and sSQI to compare with the proposed image quality index (IQI) approach. We used 1926 annotated ECGs, recorded from patient monitors, and associated with six different ECG arrhythmia alarm types which were obtained previously from an ECG alarm study at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). In addition, we applied the templates from the UCSF database to test the SSIM approach on the publicly available PhysioNet Challenge 2011 data. Results: For the UCSF database, the proposed IQI algorithm achieved an accuracy of 93.1% and outperformed all the SQI metrics, baseSQI, kSQI, and sSQI, with accuracies of 85.7%, 63.7%, and 73.8% respectively. Moreover, evaluation of our algorithm on the PhysioNet data showed an accuracy of 82.5%. Conclusion : The proposed algorithm showed better performance for assessing ECG signal quality than traditional signal processing methods. Significance: A more accurate assessment of ECG signal quality can lead to a more robust ECG-based diagnosis of cardiovascular conditions.

N2  - © 2017 IEEE. Electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings provide insights on a person's cardiac activity, and can be used to identify heartbeat abnormalities, or arrhythmia, they might suffer. Automatic ECG interpretation can be achieved via machine learning techniques to aid physicians. This research aims to model a ECG classifier based on Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Genetic Algorithm (GA) to classify a normal beat and three types of arrhythmia. SVM with radial basis function (RBF) kernel were used because of its superiority in handling the large number of numerical features generated from the ECG. GA was used to enhance the SVM by performing feature selection to generate dataset with optimal number of features, limiting possibilities of feature redundancy. ECG dataset used for model training and testing were obtained from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology-Beth Israel Hospital (MIT-BIH) arrhythmia database. The GA-SVM classifier then was compared to SVM-only classifier to ensure that GA is indeed able to improve the capabilities of SVM. Results show that in classifying six-seconds ECG recording with 120 training data and 20 testing data, GA-SVM yielded better average accuracy of 82.5%, compared to 47% yielded by SVM-only classifier.

N2  - © 2017 The Author(s). Classifying arrhythmias can be a tough task for a human being and automating this task is highly desirable. Nevertheless fully automatic arrhythmia classification through Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals is a challenging task when the inter-patient paradigm is considered. For the inter-patient paradigm, classifiers are evaluated on signals of unknown subjects, resembling the real world scenario. In this work, we explore a novel ECG representation based on vectorcardiogram (VCG), called temporal vectorcardiogram (TVCG), along with a complex network for feature extraction. We also fine-tune the SVM classifier and perform feature selection with a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. Results for the inter-patient paradigm show that the proposed method achieves the results comparable to state-of-the-art in MIT-BIH database (53% of Positive predictive (+P) for the Supraventricular ectopic beat (S) class and 87.3% of Sensitivity (Se) for the Ventricular ectopic beat (V) class) that TVCG is a richer representation of the heartbeat and that it could be useful for problems involving the cardiac signal and pattern recognition.

Methods: A single center study of children, 0 to 21 years old, admitted to an ICU who experienced cardiopulmonary arrest (CPA) requiring >1 min of chest compressions. Time of CPA was determined by analysis of continuous ECG, plethysmography, arterial blood pressure, and end-tidal CO2 (EtCO2) waveforms. Initiation of CPR was identified by the onset of cyclic artifact in the ECG waveform. Patient characteristics and unit ergonomics and human factors were examined including CPA cause, identification on the High-Risk Checklist (HRC), existing monitoring, ICU type, time of day, nursing shift change, and outcome. Results: The median time from CPA to initiation of CPR was 50.5 s (IQR 26.5 to 127.5) in 36 CPAs. Forty-seven percent of patients experienced time from CPA to initiation of CPR of >1 min. There was no difference in CPA cause, ICU type, time of day, or nursing shift change. Conclusion: Nearly half of pediatric patients who experienced CPA in an ICU setting did not meet AHA guidelines for early initiation of CPR. This is an opportunity to study the recognition phase of CPA using continuous monitoring data with the aim of improving the understanding of and factors contributing to delays in initiation of CPR.

Since the interpretation of ECG signals is a time consuming and demanding process for physicians, detailed analysis and interpretation software that gives the same result as the diagnosis of the physician at high rates by interpreting these signals in the computer environment is being developed and its usage is increasing. In this study, automatic detection of Normal Beat (NOR), APC (Atrial Premature Contraction) and PVC (Ventricular Premature Contraction) arrhythmia was studied and it was aimed to catch the points that the physician would avoid from the eye and to facilitate the treatment. In the study, the energy of the pulses was calculated, analyzed with Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and classified according to Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA).

Objective: This work aims at providing a new method for the automatic detection of atrial fibrillation, other arrhythmia and noise on short single-lead ECG signals, emphasizing the importance of the interpretability of the classification results. Approach: A morphological and rhythm description of the cardiac behavior is obtained by a knowledge-based interpretation of the signal using the Construe abductive framework. Then, a set of meaningful features are extracted for each individual heartbeat and as a summary of the full record. The feature distributions can be used to elucidate the expert criteria underlying the labeling of the 2017 PhysioNet/CinC Challenge dataset, enabling a manual partial relabeling to improve the consistency of the training set. Finally, a tree gradient boosting model and a recurrent neural network are combined using the stacking technique to provide an answer on the basis of the feature values. Main results: The proposal was independently validated against the hidden dataset of the Challenge, achieving a combined F 1 score of 0.83 and tying for the first place in the official stage of the Challenge. This result was even improved in the follow-up stage to 0.85 with a significant simplification of the model, attaining the highest score so far reported on the hidden dataset. Significance: The obtained results demonstrate the potential of Construe to provide robust and valuable descriptions of temporal data, even with the presence of significant amounts of noise. Furthermore, the importance of consistent classification criteria in manually labeled training datasets is emphasized, and the fundamental advantages of knowledge-based approaches to formalize and validate those criteria are discussed.

N2  - © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature and Neurocritical Care Society. Background: A challenge in ICU EEG interpretation is identifying subclinical status epilepticus versus patterns on the ictal–interictal continuum versus other repetitive patterns. In the electrically noisy intensive care unit, identifying and eliminating interference and artifact allow accurate diagnoses from the EEG, avoiding unnecessary treatment or sedation. Methods: We present a case during Impella (Abiomed Inc, Danvers, MA) continuous flow left ventricular assist device use where the EEG artifact was initially misinterpreted as seizure by the resident and treated as status epilepticus because of the “focal” sharply contoured repetitive pattern. During percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), an 88-year-old developed ventricular tachycardia followed by ventricular fibrillation requiring chest compressions for 10 min, multiple defibrillations, and treatment with epinephrine, amiodarone, calcium, bicarbonate, and magnesium. The patient had an Impella placed during PCI with therapeutic hypothermia initiated after the cardiopulmonary arrest. His neurological exam demonstrated preserved pupillary, corneal, gag and cough reflexes and spontaneous respirations. Results: Long-term video EEG monitoring is included in our institution’s hypothermia protocol. Initial baseline EEG performed 2 h after PCI showed a persistent rhythmic sharp discharge from the left central temporal region resembling left hemisphere status epilepticus. The sharp waves have an alternating repeating 2:1 relationship with the EKG rhythm strip. This is best seen in the left hemisphere, which we posit is related to the Impella’s positioning across the aortic valve pointing toward the patient’s left side. A chest x-ray confirmed the device’s position immediately before EEG monitoring. Arterial pressure tracings were not available in the chart. Conclusions: There is a low-amplitude spiky artifact; however, there was no pacing at that time. It is possible that synergistic flow with systole/diastole reinforced the pulsatility with movement of the Impella, resulting in the alternating pattern. The patient’s hemodynamic instability precluded extensive troubleshooting with the Impella device, but after EEG repositioning, the artifact was eliminated.

Response to such emergency situation will depend upon the resources available at that instant. A response time of any healthcare system will make a difference between life and death of a victim. In this work, the authors investigated the performance of various routing protocols for Ad Hoc network application in healthcare services for emergency situations where the data from the patients were collected via wearable devices. The comparison study is done to test the suitability of the Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols for such m-health applications established through an ad hoc network. The established network, however, diagnoses the patient’s parameters on real-time basis and sends the data to the doctors and to a database within the hospital, which is constantly monitored, creating a virtual Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for a victim so as to address any abnormal behaviour during remote process. The proposed architecture was designed with the aim to manage emergency situations by reducing delays and increase the effectiveness of the patient monitoring mechanism in situations where the delay in providing medical aid to the patient maked a difference to his/her survival. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the study, an Electrocardiogram (ECG) pattern of a patient was monitored on real-time basis. A custom packet frame was designed for data transmission having a special field to store ECG data along with other general information as per the packet standards.

Objectives: To understand ICU nurses’ approaches to customization of electrocardiographic (ECG) monitor alarms. Methods: A convergent mixed methods study was conducted in 3 ICUs in 1 hospital. Data on the type and frequency of ECG alarm customization were collected from patient monitors (n=298). Nurses’ customization clinical reasoning was explored through semi-structured interviews (n=27). Results: Of the 298 patients, 58.7% had ≥1 alarm(s) customized. Heart rate limits, irregular heart rate, and atrial fibrillation were the most commonly customized alarms. Interviews revealed that customization practices varied widely and were influenced by factors including clinical expertise, lack of customization education, and negative experiences. Conclusion: Alarm customization is nuanced and requires adequate support to develop safe and effective practices. The challenges identified can inform development of strategies to improve alarm customization.

Electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring is widely used to detect arrhythmia. The number of ECG recordings is increasing due to aging populations and availability of easy-to-use wearable devices. Manual interpretation of the high volume of recorded ECGs might not be a feasible and scalable solution. Therefore, machine learning algorithms are widely used for automatic ECG interpretation. In this paper, the challenges and differences between machine learning techniques for ECG monitoring and interpretation are reviewed, from traditional machine learning classifiers to deep learning and their combination.

With the improvement of medical data capturing, vast amount of continuous patient monitoring data, e.g., electrocardiogram (ECG), real-time vital signs and medications, become available for clinical decision support at intensive care units (ICUs). However, it becomes increasingly challenging to model such data, due to high density of the monitoring data, heterogeneous data types and the requirement for interpretable models. Integration of these high-density monitoring data with the discrete clinical events (including diagnosis, medications, labs) is challenging but potentially rewarding since richness and granularity in such multimodal data increase the possibilities for accurate detection of complex problems and predicting outcomes (e.g., length of stay and mortality). We propose Recurrent Attentive and Intensive Model (RAIM) for jointly analyzing continuous monitoring data and discrete clinical events. RAIM introduces an efficient attention mechanism for continuous monitoring data (e.g., ECG), which is guided by discrete clinical events (e.g, medication usage). We apply RAIM in predicting physiological decompensation and length of stay in those critically ill patients at ICU. With evaluations on MIMIC-III Waveform Database Matched Subset, we obtain an AUC-ROC score of 90.18% for predicting decompensation and an accuracy of 86.82% for forecasting length of stay with our final model, which outperforms our six baseline models.

N2  - © 2013 IEEE. Accurate detection of characteristic electrocardiogram (ECG) waves is necessary for ECG analysis and interpretation. In this paper, we distinguish four processing steps of detection algorithms: noise and artifacts reduction, transformations, fiducial marks selection of wave candidates, and decision rule. Processing steps combinations from several detection algorithms are used to find QRS, P, and T wave peaks. In addition, we consider the search window parameter modification based on waveform templates extracted by heart cycles clustering. The methods are extensively evaluated on two public ECG databases containing QRS, P, and T wave peaks annotations. We found that the combination of morphological mathematical filtering with Elgendi's algorithm works best for QRS detection on MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database (detection error rate (DER = 0.48%, Lead I). The combination of modified Martinez's PT and wavelet transform (WT) methods gave the best results for P wave peaks detection on both databases, when both leads are considered (MIT-BIH arrhythmia database: DER = 32.13%, Lead I, DER = 42.52%, Lead II; QT Database: DER = 21.23%, Lead I, DER = 26.80%, Lead II). Waveform templates in combination with Martinez's WT obtained the best results for T wave peaks detection on QT database (DER = 25.15%, Lead II). This paper demonstrates that combining some of the best proposed methods in literature leads to improvements over the original methods for ECG waves detection while maintaining satisfactory computation times.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation is one of the most frequent complications and a major risk of morbidity and mortality after cardiac surgery. Antioxidants such as vitamin C are used for prevention of this arrhythmia. Different results of studies have been reported, but most of them have shown efficiency of vitamin C in prophylaxis of postoperative AF. We tried to examine this efficacy with larger sample size. METHODS: Three hundred and fourteen on pump coronary artery bypass graft surgery alone. Patients were divided into two groups: The intervention group received vitamin C (N = 160) and the control group did not receive any (N = 154). Intervention group was administered two grams of vitamin C intravenously (IV) 24 hours preoperatively, 500 mg every 12 hours IV for 48 hours in ICU, and 500 mg every 12 hours PO for 48 hours in ward. Continuous monitoring in ICU and three times a day ECG was used for AF detection. The two groups were compared. RESULTS: The two groups were matched in terms of age, sex, LA size, ejection fraction, functional class, and TSH level. Of the patients, 244 were male. Mean age was 62 years (40-84 years) in both groups. M/F ratio was four in both groups. Functional class and ejection fraction were the same in both groups. There was no mean TSH level difference. AF occurrence in vitamin C group was 7.6 % and in control group was 7.8 %. There was no difference in ICU or hospital stay. CONCLUSIONS: Prophylactic use of vitamin C does not further reduce postoperative atrial fibrillation in on pump CABG patients.

N2  - © 2018 Creative Commons Attribution. T-wave alternans (TWA) is an every-other-beat fluctuation of the T-wave amplitude, often at microvolt (invisible) levels. It is recognized as an important risk index of severe ventricular arrhythmias, leading sometimes to sudden cardiac arrest. Many algorithms for automatic detection and quantification of TWA have been proposed; when applied to the same electrocardiogram (ECG), they may provide a different TWA quantification, making interpretation of differences difficult. Aim of this work is to propose TWA Simulator as a useful tool to validate and compare TWA identification methods. TWA Simulator is a user-friendly MATLAB graphical user interface (GUI) able to generate, model, visualize and store simulated ECG (SECG) affected by TWA of known morphology and amplitude. SECG is constructed by a N-fold repetition of a template, constituted by a real and clean ECG beat. Both number of beats and RR inter-beat variability can be set by the user. Both direct and inverted TWA can be simulated. Direct TWA is simulated by adding a waveform (among four possibility) to every other T wave; inverted TWA is simulated by changing T-wave polarity in every-other SECG beat. Availability of TWA Simulator would allow efficient validation and comparison of automatic TWA identification methods by helping interpretation of results.

N2  - © 2018 The Author(s). Background: Fluoxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) commonly used in the treatment of depression. While most intoxications with SSRI's have favorable outcomes and do not require interventions other than strict observation of vital signs and heart rhythm, clinicians should be aware of the life-threatening complications that may occur. Case presentation: A 61-year-old woman presented to the emergency department after an intentional multiple drug overdose. Upon examination, she was somnolent with stable respiration and hemodynamics. Electrocardiography showed a prolonged QTc interval of 503ms. The patient was admitted to the ICU for cardiopulmonary monitoring. During admission, the patient remained stable and showed improved neurologic function over time. After 22h, a second ECG showed normalization of the QTc interval to 458ms. However, 36 to 40h after admission, our patient developed recurrent episodes of Torsades de Pointes (TdP) with loss of cardiac output, leading to cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Spontaneous circulation was restored after intravenous administration of magnesium sulphate. Retrospective serum analysis revealed fluoxetine concentrations of 2700mcg/l. Conclusion: Most intoxications with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) have favorable outcomes and do not require medical interventions other than strict cardiopulmonary observation. However, higher doses have been associated with QTc interval prolongation, TdP, serotonin syndrome, and death. This case illustrates that life-threatening complications may occur late in the course of hospital admission. Even though overdoses with SSRI's generally result in few fatalities, clinicians should be aware of the life-threatening clinical manifestations that may occur. Despite being an imperfect predictor of imminent TdP, continuous monitoring of cardiac rhythm is strongly recommended when either cardiac or non-cardiac symptoms are present.

Background Recognition of out-of-hospital-cardiac arrests (OHCAs) at emergency medical communication centres is based on questions of OHCA symptoms, resulting in 50-80% accuracy rates. However, OHCAs might be recognized more promptly using 'rhythm-based' recognition, whereby a victim's cardiac rhythm is recorded with mobile phone technology that analyses and transmits recordings to emergency medical communication centres for further interpretation. Objective To examine whether the quality of normal cardiac rhythm and the rhythm with the best prognosis in OHCA, ventricular fibrillation (VF), is sufficient for 'rhythm-based' OHCA recognition when recorded within a mobile phone-sized device. Patients and methods mid-sternum within an area the size of a mobile phone and analysed by automated external defibrillator (AED) software and two cardiologists. The rhythms were categorized as shockable or nonshockable. The cardiologists assessed the quality of the recordings. Results The AED software correctly analysed all normal rhythms and 15 of 22 VF rhythms. The VF duration was too short for automatic detection in seven cases. The cardiologists analysed all the normal rhythms and VF sequences correctly and graded them as high quality. Conclusion The recordings of normal ECG rhythm and VF within an area the size of a mobile phone are of sufficient quality and could be used in 'rhythm-based' OHCA recognition. The VF period was too short for an accurate analysis by the AED software in some cases.

N2  - © 2018 Elsevier Inc. The convergence between wearable and medical device technologies is a natural progression. Miniaturization has allowed the design of small, compact monitoring systems that can record physiological signals over longer periods of time. Thus, the potential for these devices to expand the understanding of disease progression and patients' clinical status is very high. The accuracy of these devices, however, is dependent upon the computer algorithms utilized in the analysis of the large volume of physiological data monitored and/or recorded by the devices. Automated interpretation of the data by these new technologies, therefore, necessitates closer examination by regulatory organizations. The current requirements for the validation of novel Ambulatory ECG (A-ECG) annotation algorithms are based on the AAMI/ANSI-EC57 and IEC60601-2-47 Standard. These standards are being updated, but they rely on a very limited set of digitized ECG recordings from a couple of ECG databases built in the first half of the 70's. These reference signals are obsolete. We are developing a validation tool for computerized methods designed to detect and monitor cardiac activities based on body-surface ECGs. We will rely on a set of existing digital high-resolution 12‑lead A-ECG recordings acquired in cardiac patients and healthy individuals. These ECG signals include a large and unique set of electrocardiographic events. This tool is being qualified by the Center for Devices and Radiological Health of the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a Medical Device Development Tool (MDDT). This document provides insights into the design of the M.A.D.A.E. database, its functionalities, and its ultimate role in enabling the next generations of automatic interpretation of ECG signals.

N2  - © 2018 Background: Handheld ECG recorders may have algorithms which automatically inform the user of presence of arrhythmia. The main objectives of this study were to evaluate the accuracy of the arrhythmia diagnosis algorithm of Beurer ME90 recorder to diagnose atrial fibrillation (AF)/flutter, and to evaluate whether recording technique (finger versus precordial) affects diagnostic performance. Methods: Consecutive patients admitted at the cardiology ward of a tertiary care hospital were enrolled. Handheld ECG recordings were performed by holding the device between index fingers (lead I), and by applying it to the chest (modified V4, mV4), with 12‑lead ECGs serving as the gold standard for presence of arrhythmia. Results: A total of 127 patients were included. The automatic arrhythmia detection algorithm identified all 16 cases of AF, but specificity was poor (62–77%, with slightly better specificity of mV4 compared to lead I). Specificity improved to 84% (95% CI 76–91%) if both lead I and mV4 recordings had to be positive for diagnosis, with a positive predictive value of 48% (95% CI 30–67%). Interpretation of the tracings by an electrophysiologist was 100% specific. Atrial flutter with regular ventricular response was however missed by automatic and manual interpretation. Conclusions: The automatic arrhythmia algorithm of the BeurerME90 device has excellent sensitivity for diagnosing AF, but with low specificity. Strategies such as first recording lead I (more practical to perform), and in case of arrhythmia detection, confirming with an mV4 recording, may be applied to reduce false positive readings requiring manual confirmation by a healthcare professional.

N2  - © 2018 This paper presents the design, testing and quantitative evaluation of a high-performance, low-power, portable multi-instrument (107×79mm2), capable of recording important biosignals accurately and in real-time. This highly versatile system has the ability to transmit the captured bio-data back to the user either in a wired (HDMI cable) or wireless (ZigBee protocol) manner, depending on the targeted application. The biological information that can be recorded by the proposed instrument spans a wide range of bio-potentials and bio-amperometric signals. The proposed instrument is split into two complementary “sub-instruments” where one is operating as the front-end device, responsible for the accurate, low-noise signal detection and transmission, while the second “sub-instrument” is operating as the “base station” responsible for the collection and further processing of the captured data. For wired transmission (e.g to the user's PC) the front end module can operate independently, however, for wireless transmission both “sub-instruments” are required (transmitter-base station architecture). For wireless transmission, each of the two “sub-instruments” is equipped with dedicated 2 Mbps ZigBee radio transceivers and both parts are controlled by a small area embedded FPGA module. The front-end device features two distinct sections: (a) a current/voltage to voltage section comprising six potentiometry and two transimpedance amplifier-based amperometry channels. These eight in total analogue channels are converted into digital form by means of a 24 bit, voltage input, Analogue-to-Digital Converter (ADC) and (b) a four channel, commercially available switched-capacitor-based ADC Integrated Circuit (IC), which converts input charge to digital data with 16 or 20 bit resolution at 3.125 kSPS. The paper presents a plethora of measured wired and wireless experimental results, corresponding to most well-known biomedical and other biological/physical signals including: EEG, ECoG, EMG, ECG, PPG, intracardiac atrial fibrillation (AF) signals, cell media/tissue biopotential, drosophila H1-cell spiking signals and pH sensing using commercially available electrodes. The portable/wearable poly-instrument is suitable for Intensive Care Unit (ICU), High Dependancy Unit (HDU) as well as home monitoring.

N2  - © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019. Heart sounds recognition is essential for heart defects diagnosis. Diagnosis of structural heart defects is not always possible using the contemporary stethoscope and need further assessment using high cost devices such as X-ray, electrocardiogram (ECG), echocardiography (ECHO) and computed tomography (CT)). Automatic computer assisted auscultation may be used as a clinical decision support tool. In an attempt to develop an automatic computer aided diagnostic modality for heart conditions that is sensitive, specific, non-invasive we created two automatic computer cardiac auscultation (ACCA) models that provide heart sound analysis and we aimed to improve the sensitivity and correct classification rate (CCR) of recognition of heart sounds, thus we developed model A ACCA recognition system (machine learning (interpreter independent)) and model B ACCA recognition system (machine learning and interpreter dependent visual analysis). We used machine learning based on mel frequency cepestral coefficients as a feature and Hidden Markov Model (HMM) as a classifier. We performed visual analysis based on phonocardiography (PCG) and spectrogram image. Model A ACCA demonstrated 97% CCR, 99.2% sensitivity and specificity 100% and model B ACCA demonstrated 98.2% CCR and 99.2% sensitivity and specificity 100%. ACCA models A and B allow reliable interpretation of recognised sounds to detect underlying structural defects.

The analysis and interpretation of the ECG signal, mainly considering long monitoring examinations, is fundamental for diagnosing arrhythmias and conduction disturbances. Hence, a reliable assessment for the exam is extremely dependent on the quality of signal recording and the accuracy of extracting all the available features. It is well known that the automatic delineation of ECG characteristic waves and the quantitative analysis of timeseries, waveforms, and amplitudes derived from ECG segmentation behave as challenging tasks, considering both the broad range of observed morphologies and also the inherent noise sensibility. But what kind of metrics are desirable for a beat-to-beat analysis aiming the evaluation of myocardial contraction and heart electrical system? So in this chapter, we will detail the state-of-the-art features, which can be automatically extracted from this biomedical signal for providing useful diagnostic information or even help to predict adverse events.

Watermarking is currently investigated as an efficient and safe method of embedding additional patient or environment-related data into the electrocardiogram. This paper presents experimental work on the assessment of the loss of ECG (electrocardiogram signal) diagnostic quality from the industrial standard EN60601-2-25:2015 point of view. We implemented an original time-frequency watermarking technique with an adaptive beat-to-beat lead-independent data container design. We tested six wavelets, six coding bit depth values (including the automatic noise-dependent one) and two types of watermark content to find the conditions that are necessary for watermarked ECG to maintain the compliance with International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) requirements for interpretation performance. Unlike other authors, we did not assess the differences of signal values, but errors in ECG wave delineation results. The results of a total of 7300 original and watermarked 10 s ECGs were statistically processed to reveal possible interpretation quality degradation due to watermarking. Finally we found (1) the Symlet of 11-th order as the best of the wavelets that were tested; (2) the important role of ECG wave delineation and noise tracking procedures; (3) the high influence of the watermark-to-noise similarity of amplitude and values distribution and (4) the stability of the watermarking capacity for different heart rates in atrial rhythms.

N2  - © 2019, Springer Nature B.V. Respiratory rate (RR) is one of the most sensitive markers of a deteriorating patient. Despite this, there is significant inter-observer discrepancy when measured by clinical staff, and modalities used in clinical practice such as ECG bioimpedance are prone to error. This study utilized infrared thermography (IRT) to measure RR in a critically ill population in the Intensive Care Unit. This study was carried out in a Single Hospital Centre. Respiratory rate in 27 extubated ICU patients was counted by two observers and compared to ECG Bioimpedance and IRT-derived RR at distances of 0.4–0.6 m and > 1 m respectively. IRT-derived RR using two separate computer vision algorithms outperformed ECG derived RR at distances of 0.4–0.6 m. Using an Autocorrelation estimator, mean bias was − 0.667 breaths/min. Using a Fast Fourier Transform estimator, mean bias was − 1.000 breaths/min. At distances greater than 1 m no statistically significant signal could be obtained. Over all frequencies, there was a significant relationship between the RR estimated using IRT and via manual counting, with Pearson correlation coefficients between 0.796 and 0.943 (p < 0.001). Correlation between counting and ECG-derived RR demonstrated significance only at > 19 bpm (r = 0.562, p = 0.029). Overall agreement between IRT-derived RR at distances of 0.4–0.6 m and gold standard counting was satisfactory, and outperformed ECG derived bioimpedance. Contactless IRT derived RR may be feasible as a routine monitoring modality in wards and subacute inpatient settings.

The modern intensive care unit (ICU) contains increasingly numerous, varied and sophisticated equipment for the support and monitoring of critically ill patients. Auditory alarms are most often used in the ICU 'because hearing is a primary warning sense' and has 'generally omni-directional characteristics'. The difficulty of accurate recognition of auditory warnings in the ICU is known to have had fatal consequences; for instance, a patient death attributed to confusion between the ventilator and ECG alarms. The majority of auditory warnings emitted in an ICU are in fact false alarms, triggered by interference. The chapter highlights the problems facing operators of medical equipment and their associated auditory alarms. Two experiments are designed to investigate aspects of the learning, retention and confusion of ICU alarms. Experiment 1 measured the identification of auditory warnings by experienced ICU nurses, using stimulus sounds recorded in their own unit. Experiment 2 examined the effect of urgency mapping on the learning of paired auditory warnings/clinical situations.

We aimed to evaluate electrocardiographic (ECG) abnormalities in mortalities due to pure methadone toxicity in ICU patients since methadone-related mortality may be due to cardiac complications even in acute toxicities. In a retrospective single-center study, files of all patients who had died with confirmed diagnosis of pure methadone toxicity between 2011 and 2016 were evaluated. Autopsy was performed in all cases. A cardiologist measured all ECG quantitative and qualitative indices. Fifty-one deaths were recorded. Forty-two dead patients were males. Median [IQR] age of the patients was 44 [30, 60] years. Of them, 38 (69%) were methadone-dependent and were significantly older than methadone-naïve patients (p = 0.008 and p = 0.001, respectively). ECG abnormalities were detected in all cases. ST-T abnormalities were found in 33 (64.7%) patients. Except longer PR interval in dependent patients (p = 0.017) and specific ST elevation in naïve cases (p = 0.008), other ECG indices were similar in two groups. No correlation was found between ST-T abnormalities and coronary disease in autopsy. ECG abnormalities irrelevant to coronary artery diseases are common in methadone-related mortalities. Methadone toxicity may affect myocardium and play a role in death. Further prospective studies to evaluate other cardiac indices in methadone-poisoned patients are recommended.

N2  - © 2019 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine. Objective: Cerebrovascular reactivity (CR) is a mechanism that maintains stable blood flow supply to the brain. Pressure reactivity index (PRx), the correlation coefficient between slow waves of invasive arterial blood pressure (ABP) and intracranial pressure (ICP) has been validated for CR assessment. However, in clinical ward, not every subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) patient has invasive ABP monitoring. Pulse transit time (PTT), the propagation time of a pulse wave travelling from the heart to peripheral arteries, has been suggested as a surrogate measure of ABP. In this study, we proposed to use PTT instead of invasive ABP to monitor CR. Approach: Forty-five SAH patients with simultaneous recordings of invasive ABP, ICP, oxygen saturation level (SpO2) and electrocardiograph (ECG) were included. PTT was calculated as the time from the ECG R-wave peak to the onset of SpO2. PTT based pressure reactivity index (tPRx) was calculated as the correlation coefficient between slow waves of PTT and ICP. Wavelet tPRx (wtRx) was calculated as the cosine of wavelet phase shift between PTT and ICP. Meanwhile, PRx and wPRx were also calculated using invasive ABP and ICP as input. Main results: The result showed a negative relationship between PTT and ABP (r = -0.58, p < 0.001). tPRx negatively correlated with PRx (r = -0.51, p = 0.003). Wavelet method correlated well with correlation method demonstrated through positive relationship between wPRx and PRx (r = 0.82, p < 0.001) as well as wtPRx and tPRx (r = 0.84, p < 0.001). Significance: PTT demonstrates great potential as a useful tool for CR assessment when invasive ABP is unavailable. Key points • Pulse transit time (PTT), defined as the propagation time of a pulse wave travelling from the heart to the peripheral arteries, has been proposed as a surrogate measure of ABP. The relationship between PTT and ABP in SAH patients remains unknown. • Cerebrovascular reactivity (CR) assessment through PTT has advantages over invasive ABP, as it avoids bleeding and infection risk, and can be used outside of the ICU. • We introduced a new method to assess CR using PTT and ICP through correlation based method and wavelet based method. • We found that beat-to-beat PTT was negatively related with invasive ABP in SAH patients. A significant linear relationship exists between PTT-based CR parameter and a well validated method, PRx. PTT demonstrates great potential as a useful tool for CR assessment when invasive ABP is unavailable in SAH patients.

N2  - Copyright © 2019 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd. Arrhythmia is a cardiac condition caused by abnormal electrical activity of the heart, which can be life-Threatening. Electrocardiogram (ECG) is the principal diagnostic tool used to detect arrhythmias or heart abnormalities. It contains information about the different types of arrhythmias. However, due to the complexity and nonlinearity of ECG signals, such as the presence of noise, the time dependence of ECG signals and the irregularity of the heartbeat, it is troublesome to analyse ECG signals manually. Moreover, the interpretation of ECG signals is subjective and might vary among experts in the field. Therefore, an automatic, high-precision ECG recognition method is important to arrhythmia detection. For such, a method is proposed in this paper for arrhythmia classification, which is based on deep learning-based approach long short-Term memory (LSTM), where five classes of arrhythmias as recommended by the Association for Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) are analysed. The method has been tested on the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database with a number of useful performance evaluation measures, showing that is a promising and better performance than other artificial intelligence methods used.

N2  - © 2018 Computerized interpretation of the electrocardiogram (ECG) began in the 1950s when conversion of its analog signal to digital form became available. Since then, automatic computer interpretations of the ECG have become routine, even at the point of care, by the addition of interpretive algorithms to portable ECG carts. Now, more than 100 million computerized ECG interpretations are recorded yearly in the United States. These interpretations have contributed to medical care by reducing physician reading time and accurately interpreting most normal ECGs. But errors do occur. The computer cannot be held responsible for misinterpretations due to recording errors, such as muscle artifacts or lead reversal. But, in many abnormal ECGs, the computer makes its own errors—sometimes critical—in its incorrect detection of arrhythmias, pacemakers, and myocardial infarctions. These errors require that all computerized statements be over-read by trained physicians who have the advantage of clinical context, unavailable to the computer. Together, the computer and over-readers now provide the most accurate ECG interpretations available.

N2  - © 2019, Springer Nature B.V. Patients who deteriorate while on the acute care ward and are emergently transferred to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) experience high rates of mortality. To date, risk scores for clinical deterioration applied to the acute care wards rely on static or intermittent inputs of vital sign and assessment parameters. We propose the use of continuous predictive analytics monitoring, or data that relies on real-time physiologic monitoring data captured from ECG, documented vital signs, laboratory results, and other clinical assessments to predict clinical deterioration. A necessary step in translation to practice is understanding how an alert threshold would perform if applied to a continuous predictive analytic that was trained to detect clinical deterioration. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the positive predictive value of ‘risk spikes’, or large abrupt increases in the output of a statistical model of risk predicting clinical deterioration. We studied 8111 consecutive patient admissions to a cardiovascular medicine and surgery ward with continuous ECG data. We first trained a multivariable logistic regression model for emergent ICU transfer in a test set and tested the characteristics of the model in a validation set of 4059 patient admissions. Then, in a nested analysis we identified large, abrupt spikes in risk (increase by three units over the prior 6 h; a unit is the fold-increase in risk of ICU transfer in the next 24 h) and reviewed hospital records of 91 patients for clinical events such as emergent ICU transfer. We compared results to 59 control patients at times when they were matched for baseline risk including the National Warning Score (NEWS). There was a 3.4-fold higher event rate for patients with risk spikes (positive predictive value 24% compared to 7%, p = 0.006). If we were to use risk spikes as an alert, they would fire about once per day on a 73-bed acute care ward. Risk spikes that were primarily driven by respiratory changes (ECG-derived respiration (EDR) or charted respiratory rate) had highest PPV (30–35%) while risk spikes driven by heart rate had the lowest (7%). Alert thresholds derived from continuous predictive analytics monitoring are able to be operationalized as a degree of change from the person’s own baseline rather than arbitrary threshold cut-points, which can likely better account for the individual’s own inherent acuity levels. Point of care clinicians in the acute care ward settings need tailored alert strategies that promote a balance in recognition of clinical deterioration and assessment of the utility of the alert approach.

N2  - © 2019 Due to its simplicity and low cost, analyzing an electrocardiogram (ECG) is the most common technique for detecting cardiac arrhythmia. The massive amount of ECG data collected every day, in home and hospital, may preclude data review by human operators/technicians. Therefore, several methods are proposed for either fully automatic arrhythmia detection or event selection for further verification by human experts. Traditional machine learning approaches have made significant progress in the past years. However, those methods rely on hand-crafted feature extraction, which requires in-depth domain knowledge and preprocessing of the signal (e.g., beat detection). This, plus the high variability in wave morphology among patients and the presence of noise, make it challenging for computerized interpretation to achieve high accuracy. Recent advances in deep learning make it possible to perform automatic high-level feature extraction and classification. Therefore, deep learning approaches have gained interest in arrhythmia detection. In this work, we reviewed the recent advancement of deep learning methods for automatic arrhythmia detection. We summarized existing literature from five aspects: utilized dataset, application, type of input data, model architecture, and performance evaluation. We also reported limitations of reviewed papers and potential future opportunities.

N2  - © 2019 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd. This is an Open Access article under the CC BY 4.0 license Background: Time delay between onset of symptoms and seeking medical attention is a major determinant of mortality and morbidity in patients with acute coronary artery occlusion. Response time might be reduced by reliable self-detection. We aimed to formally assess the proof-of-concept and accuracy of self-detection of acute coronary artery occlusion by patients during daily life situations and during the very early stages of acute coronary artery occlusion. Methods: In this multicentre, observational study, we tested the operational feasibility, specificity, and sensitivity of our RELF method, a three-lead detection system with an automatic algorithm built into a mobile handheld device, for detection of acute coronary artery occlusion. Patients were recruited continuously by physician referrals from three Belgian hospitals until the desired sample size was achieved, had been discharged with planned elective percutaneous coronary intervention, and were able to use a smartphone; they were asked to perform random ambulatory self-recordings for at least 1 week. A similar self-recording was made before percutaneous coronary intervention and at 60 s of balloon occlusion. Patients were clinically followed up until 1 month after discharge. We quantitatively assessed the operational feasibility with an automated dichotomous quality check of self-recordings. Performance was assessed by analysing the receiver operator characteristics of the ST difference vector magnitude. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02983396. Findings: From Nov 18, 2016, to April 25, 2018, we enrolled 64 patients into the study, of whom 59 (92%) were eligible for self-applications. 58 (91%) of 64 (95% CI 81·0–95·6) patients were able to perform ambulatory self-recordings. Of all 5011 self-recordings, 4567 (91%) were automatically classified as successful within 1 min. In 65 balloon occlusions, 63 index tests at 60 s of occlusion in 55 patients were available. The mean specificity of daily life recordings was 0·96 (0·95–0·97). The mean false positive rate during daily life conditions was 4·19% (95% CI 3·29–5·10). The sensitivity for the target conditions was 0·87 (55 of 63; 95% CI 0·77–0·93) for acute coronary artery occlusion, 0·95 (54 of 57; 0·86–0·98) for acute coronary artery occlusion with electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, and 1·00 (35 of 35) for acute coronary artery occlusion with ECG changes and ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction criteria (STEMI). The index test was more sensitive to detect a 60 s balloon occlusion than the STEMI criteria on 12-lead ECG (87% vs 56%; p<0·0001). The proportion of total variation in study estimates due to heterogeneity between patients (I2) was low (12·6%). The area under the receiver operator characteristics curve was 0·973 (95% CI 0·956–0·990) for acute coronary artery occlusion at different cutoff values of the magnitude of the ST difference vector. No patients died during the study. Interpretation: Self-recording with our RELF device is feasible for most patients with coronary artery disease. The sensitivity and specificity for automatic detection of the earliest phase of acute coronary artery occlusion support the concept of our RELF device for patient empowerment to reduce delay and increase Survival without overloading emergency services.

N2  - © 2019 IEEE. The high rate of false alarms in intensive care units (ICUs) is one of the top challenges of using medical technology in hospitals. These false alarms are often caused by patients' movements, detachment of monitoring sensors, or different sources of noise and interference that impact the collected signals from different monitoring devices. In this paper, we propose a novel set of high-level features based on unsupervised feature learning technique in order to effectively capture the characteristics of different arrhythmia in electrocardiogram (ECG) signal and differentiate them from irregularity in signals due to different sources of signal disturbances. This unsupervised feature learning technique, first extracts a set of low-level features from all existing heart cycles of a patient, and then clusters these segments for each individual patient to provide a set of prominent high-level features. The objective of the clustering phase is to enable the classification method to differentiate between the high-level features extracted from normal and abnormal cycles (i.e., either due to arrhythmia or different sources of distortions in signal) in order to put more attention to the features extracted from abnormal portion of the signal that contribute to the alarm.

A fundamental part of the analysis of electrocardiographic signals (ECG) lies in the transformation of the data or samples of the signal, with the aim of improving the effectiveness of the processing and the subsequent interpretation of the results obtained from it. Thus, a certain number of features are extracted, which are expected to have high discriminatory properties. In this way, the next step of the analysis must be the construction of a vector of features, which must be a set of descriptors that completely transmit the essence of the signal being studied. These features can focus on different aspects of the signal, for example, durations of intervals or segments, amplitudes of different wave peaks, deviations with respect to the isoelectric line, and areas under curves, among others. In this paper we present a method that includes the detection of temporal events of the ECG signal, such as ST segment, T wave, QRS complex and QT interval, several features are extracted using these events. The features are validated with the K-means algorithm and the feature vector is used as input in the ischemia classifier.

N2  - © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature. In this work, a novel method has been proposed for false alarm detection in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) during arrhythmia. To detect false alarm, various inputs are used such as electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, atrial blood pressure (ABP), photoplethysmogram signals (PLETH) and respiration (RESP). The inputs are given to decision tree predictive learner (DTPL) based classifier for thedetection of false alarm. The proposed method has an accuracy of 97% for prediction of false alarm in ICU. Theresult of the proposed method is promising which suggest that it can be used effectively for false alarm detection in ICUs. To the best of our knowledge, there is no such assumption based classification approach.

N2  - © 2019 Elsevier B.V. Myocardial infarction (MI), commonly known as heart attack, causes irreversible damage to heart muscles and even leads to death. Rapid and accurate diagnosis of MI is critical to avoid death. Blood tests and electrocardiogram (ECG) signals are used to diagnose acute MI. However, for an increase in blood enzyme values, a certain time must pass after the attack. This time lag may delay MI diagnosis. Hence, ECG diagnosis is still very important. Manual ECG interpretation requires expertise and is prone to inter-observer variability. Therefore, computer aided diagnosis may be useful in automatic detection of MI on ECG. In this study, a deep learning model with an end-to-end structure on the standard 12-lead ECG signal for the diagnosis of MI is proposed. For this purpose, the most commonly used technique, convolutional neural network (CNN) is used. Our trained CNN model with the proposed architecture yielded impressive accuracy and sensitivity performance over 99.00% for MI diagnosis on all ECG lead signals. Thus, the proposed model has the potential to provide high performance on MI detection which can be used in wearable technologies and intensive care units.

N2  - © 2019 IEEE. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most prevalent arrhythmia, resulting in varying and irregular heartbeats. AF increases risk for numerous cardiovascular diseases including stroke, heart failure and as a result, computer aided efficient monitoring of AF is crucial, especially for intensive care unit (ICU) patients. In this paper, we present an automated and robust algorithm to detect AF from ICU patients using electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. Several statistical parameters including root mean square of successive differences, Shannon entropy, Sample entropy and turning point ratio are calculated from the heart rate. A subset of the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) SH database containing 36 subjects is used in this study. We compare the AF detection performance of several classifiers for both the training and blinded test data. Using the support vector machine classifier with radial basis kernel, the proposed method achieves 99.95% cross-validation accuracy on the training data and 99.88% sensitivity, 99.65% specificity and 99.75% accuracy on the blinded test data.

N2  - © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland. Excessive numbers of clinical alarms in the intensive care unit (ICU) contribute to alarm fatigue. Efforts to eliminate unnecessary alarms, including during end of life (EOL) care, are pivotal. This study describes electrocardiographic (ECG) arrhythmia alarm usage following the decision for comfort care. We conducted a review of electronic health records (EHR) in patients who died and had comfort care orders that were in place during our study. The occurrences of ECG arrhythmia alarms among these patients were examined. We found 151 arrhythmia alarms that were generated in 11 patients after comfort care was initiated: 72% were audible, 21% were manually muted, and 7% had an unknown audio label. Level of alarm: 33% crisis, 58% warning, 1% message, and 8% were labeled unknown. Our report shows that ECG monitoring was commonly maintained during the EOL care. Since the goal of care during this phase is for both patient and family comfort, it is important for the clinicians to weigh the benefits versus harms of the continuous ECG monitoring.

N2  - © 2019 IEEE. Today, one of the most actual problems of cardiology is to obtain comprehensive data in everyday life to determine current cardiac states, including hidden pathologies, their interpretation and analysis. This article proposes a new method for processing measurements obtained during Holter monitoring and using only the value of the intervals between R peaks of ECG. These peaks have the biggest amplitude and their determination does not present technical difficulties. The improved graphical analysis method proposed by the authors, 'Speed Spot', allows to take into account not only the data of heart rate variability, but also includes an integral characteristic of the rate of change of the variability components. The method was used to determine the type of pathology as atrial fibrillation (AF). To confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method for the detection of arrhythmias, the Atrial Fibrillation Database of www.physionet.org was used, containing records of both normal and arrhythmic signals. A comparative analysis of the SS with Poincaré clouds for five patients with AF showed that this method is more sensitive and requires less data to determine the controlled cardiovascular state compared to similar ones. The criteria for estimating the degree of HRV (instability) by the 'Speed Spot' can be the geometrical dimensions of an ellipse: the length and width and the coordinate of its center. The proposed method, due to the symmetry of the distribution of cloud points with respect to the x-axis, provides more opportunities for use in systems for automatic tracking of heart rate disturbances. Practical application of the method to automatically determine the degree and type of arrhythmia is an object for further research. Further development of the method involves applying it to other types of hidden cardiopathology.

The objectives of this study were to identify the role of drug-drug interactions (DDIs) and other predictors (age, sex, cardiovascular diseases, and electrolyte abnormalities) in life threatening QTc prolongation in patients admitted to medical (M), surgical (S) and emergency (E) ICUs. This prospective, observational study included patients above the age of 18 years who were admitted to SICU, EICU, and MICU at a tertiary respiratory referral center. Electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring was performed during the first 5 days of ICU admission. Risk factors and DDIs which were anticipated to be associated with the prolongation of the QTc interval were assessed for all patients. Two hundred patients were included in the study. QTc prolongation occurred in 10.7% of patients and the majority of patients presenting with QTc prolongation had creatinine levels above 1.3 mg/dL during their 5 days of ICU admission. Incidence of pharmacodynamic (PD) DDIs was significantly higher in patients with QTc prolongation vs. other patients. Creatinine levels above 1.3 mg/dL and PD DDIs were associated with QTc prolongation during 5 days of ICU admission. High serum creatinine and PD DDIs can increase the risk of QTc prolongation in patients admitted to the ICU. QTc interval measurements should be performed prior to initiation or after starting any drug that is associated with QT prolongation, specifically in patients with the known risk factors.

N2  - © 2019, The Author(s). Objectives: To develop and evaluate a fully automatic method to measure diameters of the ascending and descending aorta on non-ECG-gated, non-contrast computed tomography (CT) scans. Material and methods: The method combines multi-atlas registration to obtain seed points, aorta centerline extraction, and an optimal surface segmentation approach to extract the aorta surface around the centerline. From the extracted 3D aorta segmentation, the diameter of the ascending and descending aorta was calculated at cross-sectional slices perpendicular to the extracted centerline, at the level of the pulmonary artery bifurcation, and at 1-cm intervals up to 3 cm above and below this level. Agreement with manual annotations was evaluated by dice similarity coefficient (DSC) for segmentation overlap, mean surface distance (MSD), and intra-class correlation (ICC) of diameters on 100 CT scans from a lung cancer screening trial. Repeatability of the diameter measurements was evaluated on 617 baseline-one year follow-up CT scan pairs. Results: The agreement between manual and automatic segmentations was good with 0.95 ± 0.01 DSC and 0.56 ± 0.08 mm MSD. ICC between the diameters derived from manual and from automatic segmentations was 0.97, with the per-level ICC ranging from 0.87 to 0.94. An ICC of 0.98 for all measurements and per-level ICC ranging from 0.91 to 0.96 were obtained for repeatability. Conclusion: This fully automatic method can assess diameters in the thoracic aorta reliably even in non-ECG-gated, non-contrast CT scans. This could be a promising tool to assess aorta dilatation in screening and in clinical practice. Key Points: • Fully automatic method to assess thoracic aorta diameters. • High agreement between fully automatic method and manual segmentations. • Method is suitable for non-ECG-gated CT and can therefore be used in screening.

N2  - © 2018, Springer Nature B.V. Right ventricular dysfunction (RVD) is associated with end-organ dysfunction and mortality, but has been an overlooked condition in the ICU. We hypothesized that analysis of the arterial waveform in the presence of ventricular extrasystoles could differentiate patients with RVD from patients with a normally functioning right ventricle, because the 2nd and 3rd post-ectopic beat could reflect right ventricular state (pulmonary transit time) during the preceding ectopy. We retrospectively identified patients with echocardiographic evidence of moderate-to-severe RVD and patients with a normal functioning right ventricle (control) from the MIMIC database. We identified waveform records where ECG and arterial pressure were available in combination, simultaneously with echocardiographic evaluation. Ventricular extrasystoles were visually confirmed and the median systolic blood pressure (SBP) of the 2nd and 3rd post-ectopic beats compared with the median SBP of the ten sinus beats preceding the extrasystole. We identified 34 patients in the control group and 24 patients in the RVD group with ventricular extrasystoles. The mean SBP reduction at the 2nd and 3rd beat was lower in the RVD group compared with the control group [− 1.7 (SD: 1.9) % vs. − 3.6 (SD: 1.9) %, p < 0.001], and this characteristic differentiated RVD subjects from control subjects with an AUC of 0.76 (CI [0.64; 0.89]), with a specificity of 91% and sensitivity of 50%. In this proof-of-concept study, we found that post-extrasystolic ABP characteristics were associated with RVD.

N2  - © 2019 by the authors. Recent research has proven the existence of statistical relation among fragmented QRS and several highly prevalence diseases, such as cardiac sarcoidosis, acute coronary syndrome, arrythmogenic cardiomyopathies, Brugada syndrome, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. One out of five hundred people suffer from hypertrophic cardiomyopathies. The relation among the fragmentation and arrhythmias drives the objective of this work, which is to propose a valid method for QRS fragmentation detection. With that aim, we followed a two-stage approach. First, we identified the features that better characterize the fragmentation by analyzing the physiological interpretation of multivariate approaches, such as principal component analysis (PCA) and independent component analysis (ICA). Second, we created an invariant transformation method for the multilead electrocardiogram (ECG), by scrutinizing the statistical distributions of the PCA eigenvectors and of the ICA transformation arrays, in order to anchor the desired elements in the suitable leads in the feature space. A complete database was compounded incorporating real fragmented ECGs, surrogate registers by synthetically adding fragmented activity to real non-fragmented ECG registers, and standard clean ECGs. Results showed that the creation of beat templates together with the application of PCA over eight independent leads achieves 0.995 fragmentation enhancement ratio and 0.07 dispersion coefficient. In the case of ICA over twelve leads, the results were 0.995 fragmentation enhancement ratio and 0.70 dispersion coefficient. We conclude that the algorithm presented in this work constructs a new paradigm, by creating a systematic and powerful tool for clinical anamnesis and evaluation based on multilead ECG. This approach consistently consolidates the inconspicuous elements present in multiple leads onto designated variables in the output space, hence offering additional and valid visual and non-visual information to standard clinical review, and opening the door to a more accurate automatic detection and statistically valid systematic approach for a wide number of applications. In this direction and within the companion paper, further developments are presented applying this technique to fragmentation detection.

N2  - © 2020 Journal of Datta Meghe Institute of Medical Sciences University | Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow. Aim: Early identification of cardiac involvement in acute pancreatitis and their appropriate management can decrease significant morbidity and mortality. Very few studies have focused prospectively on cardiac involvement and its association with prognosis in acute pancreatitis. Materials and Methods: Forty-two patients admitted in Acharya Vinoba Bhave Rural Hospital, Sawangi, Wardha, were enrolled in this study and were divided based on PaO2into Group 1 (PaO2> 60 mmHg) and Group 2 (PaO2< 60 mmHg). Hologram with peripheral smear, blood sugar both fasting and postprandial, hemoglobin A1C, blood urea, creatinine, serum bilirubin, aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, cardiac enzymes, serum amylase, and lipase were measured. Prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, and lipid profile were measured and arterial blood gas analysis was done. All patients had undergone plane chest X-ray, ultrasonography of the abdomen, contrast-enhanced computed tomography of the abdomen, electrocardiogram (ECG), and two-dimensional (2D) echocardiography (ECHO). Results: 2D echocardiographic changes were more common in Group 2 as compared to Group 1 and were statistically significant (P = 0.004). Pericardial effusion and diastolic dysfunction were more common in Group 2 and were statistically significant (P = 0.006 and 0.031, respectively) whereas the difference between the association of regional wall motion abnormality (RWMA) in the two groups was statistically insignificant (P = 0.110). Both ECG and 2D echocardiogram (ECHO) changes were reversible and were statistically significant (P = 0.05 and 0.003, respectively). The need for admission in the intensive care unit (ICU) was significantly associated with pericardial effusion (P < 0.001) and diastolic dysfunction (P = 0.013) but not associated with RWMA (P = 0.710). ECG abnormalities at admission were not related to the need for mechanical ventilation and admission to ICU (P = 0.802). Conclusion: 2D ECHO abnormalities and not the ECG abnormalities were associated with a poor prognosis. Early recognition of echocardiographic changes in acute pancreatitis can predict the severity of disease and can help in the triage of patients requiring rigorous monitoring of respiratory and hemodynamic status.

N2  - © 2019 Elsevier Inc. Background: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is often detected for the first time in patients hospitalized for medical illness or non-cardiovascular surgery. AF occurring transiently with stress (AFOTS) describes this manifestation of AF, which may either be the result of a non-cardiac stressor, or existing paroxysmal AF that was not previously detected. Current estimates of AFOTS incidence are imprecise: ranging from 1 to 44%, owing to the marked heterogeneity in patient populations, identification and methods used to detect AFOTS. Methods: The prospective, two-centre epidemiological AFOTS Incidence study will enroll 250 consecutive participants without a history of AF but with at increased risk of AF (Age ≥ 65 or >50 with one risk factor for AF) admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) for medical illness or non-cardiac surgery. Upon admission, participants will wear an ECG patch monitor that will remain in place for 14 days, or until discharge from hospital. Patients' consent to participation is deferred for up to 72 h after admission. The primary endpoint is the incidence of AF lasting ≥30 s. The study is powered to detect an AF incidence of 17% ± 5%. Results: We conducted a vanguard feasibility study, and 55 participants have completed participation. The median duration of monitoring was seven days. AF was detected by the clinical team in 8 participants (14%; 95% Confidence Interval 7–26%). Conclusions: The AFOTS Incidence study will employ a systematic and highly sensitive protocol for detecting AFOTS in medical illness and non-cardiac surgery ICU patients. This study is feasible and will provide a reliable estimate of the true incidence of AFOTS in this population.

N2  - © 2019 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd. Electrocardiogram (ECG) is a primary diagnostic tool for cardiovascular diseases. A higher accuracy of heart diseases needs an automatic classification for intelligent interpretation of cardiac arrhythmia. The classification process consists of following stages: detection of QRS complex in ECG signal, feature extraction from detected QRS using R-R interval, segmentation of rhythms using extracted feature set, learning system by using Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). The performance is analyzed as a rhythm of arrhythmia classifier and MIT-BIH arrhythmia database uses to validate the method. To benchmark, the performance of DNNs algorithm is compared to, MLP and SVM algorithm in terms of accuracy. The result obtained show that the proposed method provides good accuracy about 97.7 % with less expert interaction.

N2  - © 2020, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature. Electrocardiography is a useful diagnostic tool for various cardiovascular diseases, such as myocardial infarction (MI). An electrocardiograph (ECG) records the electrical activity of the heart, which can reflect any abnormal activity. MI recognition by visual examination of an ECG requires an expert’s interpretation and is difficult because of the short duration and small amplitude of the changes in ECG signals associated with MI. Therefore, we propose a new method for the automatic detection of MI using ECG signals. In this study, we used maximal overlap discrete wavelet transform to decompose the data, extracted the variance, inter-quartile range, Pearson correlation coefficient, Hoeffding’s D correlation coefficient and Shannon entropy of the wavelet coefficients and used the k-nearest neighbor model to detect MI. The accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of the model were 99.57%, 99.82% and 98.79%, respectively. Therefore, the system can be used in clinics to help diagnose MI.

N2  - © 2019 The Author(s). Background: It is widely accepted by the scientific community that bioelectrical signals, which can be used for the identification of neurophysiological biomarkers indicative of a diseased or pathological state, could direct patient treatment towards more effective therapeutic strategies. However, the design and realisation of an instrument that can precisely record weak bioelectrical signals in the presence of strong interference stemming from a noisy clinical environment is one of the most difficult challenges associated with the strategy of monitoring bioelectrical signals for diagnostic purposes. Moreover, since patients often have to cope with the problem of limited mobility being connected to bulky and mains-powered instruments, there is a growing demand for small-sized, high-performance and ambulatory biopotential acquisition systems in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and in High-dependency wards. Finally, to the best of our knowledge, there are no commercial, small, battery-powered, wearable and wireless recording-only instruments that claim the capability of recording electrocorticographic (ECoG) signals. Methods: To address this problem, we designed and developed a low-noise (8 nV/√Hz), eight-channel, battery-powered, wearable and wireless instrument (55 × 80 mm2). The performance of the realised instrument was assessed by conducting both ex vivo and in vivo experiments. Results: To provide ex vivo proof-of-function, a wide variety of high-quality bioelectrical signal recordings are reported, including electroencephalographic (EEG), electromyographic (EMG), electrocardiographic (ECG), acceleration signals, and muscle fasciculations. Low-noise in vivo recordings of weak local field potentials (LFPs), which were wirelessly acquired in real time using segmented deep brain stimulation (DBS) electrodes implanted in the thalamus of a non-human primate, are also presented. Conclusions: The combination of desirable features and capabilities of this instrument, namely its small size (∼one business card), its enhanced recording capabilities, its increased processing capabilities, its manufacturability (since it was designed using discrete off-the-shelf components), the wide bandwidth it offers (0.5-500 Hz) and the plurality of bioelectrical signals it can precisely record, render it a versatile and reliable tool to be utilized in a wide range of applications and environments.

N2  - © School of Engineering, Taylor's University The electrocardiogram records the cardiovascular action, is widely utilized for diagnosing heart diseases. Thus, the ECG turned into a normal piece of any complete medical evaluation. Moreover, the ECG became a basic device that allows observing a patient who is at home. R-peak is the basis peak for reliable health condition observing. The ECG has been treated as one of the least difficult techniques for automatic detection of the QRS complex. Nevertheless, the ECG signal transmission is often accompanied by noise due to poor channel conditions. This paper aims to remove the noise from the ECG signal to present a signal that makes a visual interpretation easier. Numerous techniques launched to improve the ECG signal. Accordingly, we address the ECG signal through three techniques: Empirical Mode Decomposition, Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition, and Complementary Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition. Moreover, we will make some improvements to the ECG signal using the Butterworth filter and Wavelet filter. Finally, this research provides a comparison of the result obtained from all models based on four different types of classification algorithms: K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes, and Random Forest. Consequently, we are investigating various tests to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach to discover the best steps to address the ECG signals.

N2  - © 2020, The Author(s). Refeeding syndrome (RFS) is a rare, potentially life-threatening, condition seen in malnourished patients starting refeeding. RFS may provoke seizures and acute encephalopathy and can be considered an internal severe neurotrauma in need of specific treatment. The objective was to describe course of disease, treatment and, for the first time, multimodal monitoring output in a comatose patient suffering RFS. After gastric-banding and severe weight loss, the patient initiated self-starving and was transferred to our intensive care unit (ICU) following rapid refeeding. At arrival, seizures, decrease in consciousness (GCS 7) and suspected acute encephalitis was presented. Serum albumin was 8 g/l. Intracranial pressure (ICP), invasive blood pressure and electrocardiography (ECG) were monitored. Pressure reactivity (PRx) and compliance (RAP) were calculated. The patient developed congestive heart failure, anuria and general oedema despite maximal neuro- and general ICU treatment. Global cerebral oedema and hypoperfusion areas with established ischemia were seen. ECG revealed massive cardiac arrhythmia and disturbed autonomic regulation. PRx indicated intact autoregulation (−0.06 ± 0.18, mean ± SD) and relatively normal compliance (RAP = 0.23 ± 0.13). After 15 days the clinical state was improved, and the patient returned to the primary hospital. RFS was associated with serious deviations in homeostasis, high ICP levels, ECG abnormalities, kidney and lung affections. It is of utmost importance to recognize this rare syndrome and to treat appropriately. Despite the severe clinical state, cerebral autoregulation and compensatory reserve were generally normal, questioning the applicability of indirect measurements such as PRx and RAP during neuro-intensive care treatment of RFS patients with cerebral engagement.

Objective: Assess the accuracy of ECG interpretation programs in detecting abnormal rhythms and flagging for priority review records with alterations secondary to acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Methods: More than 2,000 digital ECGs from hospitals and databases in Europe, USA, and Australia, were obtained from consecutive adult and pediatric patients and converted to 10 s analog samples that were replayed on seven electrocardiographs and classified by the manufacturers' interpretation programs. We assessed ability to distinguish sinus rhythm from non-sinus rhythm, identify atrial fibrillation/flutter and other abnormal rhythms, and accuracy in flagging results for priority review. If all seven programs' interpretation statements did not agree, cases were reviewed by experienced cardiologists. Results: All programs could distinguish well between sinus and non-sinus rhythms and could identify atrial fibrillation/flutter or other abnormal rhythms. However, false-positive rates varied from 2.1% to 5.5% for non-sinus rhythm, from 0.7% to 4.4% for atrial fibrillation/flutter, and from 1.5% to 3.0% for other abnormal rhythms. False-negative rates varied from 12.0% to 7.5%, 9.9% to 2.7%, and 55.9% to 30.5%, respectively. Flagging of ACS varied by a factor of 2.5 between programs. Physicians flagged more ECGs for prompt review, but also showed variance of around a factor of 2. False-negative values differed between programs by a factor of 2 but was high for all (>50%). Agreement between programs and majority reviewer decisions was 46–62%. Conclusions: Automatic interpretations of rhythms and ACS differ between programs. Healthcare institutions should not rely on ECG software “critical result” flags alone to decide the ACS workflow.

N2  - © 2020 American Medical Association. All rights reserved. Background: Ventricular tachycardia (V-tach) is the most common lethal arrhythmia, yet 90% of alarms are false and contribute to alarm fatigue. We hypothesize that some true V-tach also causes alarm fatigue because current criteria are too sensitive (i.e., ≥6 beats ≥100 beats/min [bpm]). Purpose: This study was designed to determine (1) the proportion of clinically actionable true V-tach events; (2) whether true actionable versus nonactionable V-tach differs in terms of heart rate and/or duration (seconds); and (3) if actionable V-tach is associated with adverse outcomes. Methods: This was a secondary analysis in 460 intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Electronic health records were examined to determine if a V-tach event was actionable or nonactionable. Actionable V-tach was defined if a clinical action(s) was taken within 15 minutes of its occurrence (i.e., new and/or change of medication, defibrillation, and/or laboratory test). Maximal heart rate and duration for each V-tach event were measured from bedside monitor electrocardiography. Adverse patient outcomes included a code blue event and/or death. Results: In 460 ICU patients, 50 (11%) had 151 true V-tach events (range 1-20). Of the 50 patients, 40 (80%) had only nonactionable V-tach (97 events); 3 (6%) had both actionable and nonactionable V-tach (32 events); and 7 patients (14%) had only actionable V-tach (23 events). There were differences in duration comparing actionable versus nonactionable V-tach (mean 56.19 ± 116.87 seconds vs. 4.28 ± 4.09 seconds; P = 0.001) and maximal heart rate (188.81 ± 116.83 bpm vs. 150.79 ± 28.26 bpm; P = 0.001). Of the 50 patients, 3 (6%) had a code blue, 2 died, and all were in the actionable V-tach group. Conclusions: In our sample, <1% experienced a code blue following true V-tach. Heart rate and duration for actionable V-tach were much faster and longer than that for nonactionable V-tach. Current default settings typically used for electrocardiographic monitoring (i.e., ≥6 beats ≥100 bpm) appear to be too conservative and can lead to crisis/red level nuisance alarms that contribute to alarm fatigue. A prospective study designed to test whether adjusting default settings to these higher levels is safe for patients is needed.

N2  - © 2020 SERSC. One of the most dangerous cardiovascular diseases is Myocardial Infarction for human beings. It is commonly recognized as heart attack. Myocardial Infarction (MI) is caused by the impairment of cardiac muscle. The Electro Cardio Gram logs the electric pulse of the heart and these data are able to reflect the aberrant actions of the heart. When there is a block in veins of heart the flow of oxygen to cardiovascular muscle gets stopped which make hurt to heart muscles. The irrevocable harm may prompt to mortality. With the quick upgradation of wearable devices and favorable electrocardiogram (ECG) clinical apparatus, it is reasonable and feasible to identify and screen dead tissue in heart muscles. Fast and accurate identification of Myocardial Infarction is necessary to decrease the mortality rate. Physical Electro Cardio Gram understanding needs skilled and is leads to inter-observer variability and more time is consumed for it. The physical interpretation may change from one individual to another. Automatic detection of MI on ECG can be done with a computer aided diagnosis. The aim is to give an algorithm for the ML detection that process directly on information of ECG. The images are classified using a deep learning model with ResNet and images are identified to check whether there is a presence of Myocardial Infarction or not. The ResNet is capable of calculating an image accurately. The proposed ResNet model yields 96% accuracy for the given dataset.

N2  - © 2020 Elsevier B.V. Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) is the leading cause of human mortality and morbidity around the world, in which myocardial infarction (MI) is a silent condition that irreversibly damages the heart muscles. Currently, electrocardiogram (ECG) is widely used by the clinicians to diagnose MI patients due to its inexpensiveness and non-invasive nature. Pathological alterations provoked by MI cause slow conduction by increasing axial resistance on coupling between cells. This issue may cause abnormal patterns in the dynamics of the tip of the cardiac vector in the ECG signals. However, manual interpretation of the pathological alternations induced by MI is a time-consuming, tedious and subjective task. To overcome such disadvantages, computer-aided diagnosis techniques including signal processing and artificial intelligence tools have been developed. In this study we propose a novel technique for automatic detection of MI based on hybrid feature extraction and artificial intelligence tools. Tunable quality factor (Q-factor) wavelet transform (TQWT), variational mode decomposition (VMD) and phase space reconstruction (PSR) are utilized to extract representative features to form cardiac vectors with synthesis of the standard 12-lead and Frank XYZ leads. They are combined with neural networks to model, identify and detect abnormal patterns in the dynamics of cardiac system caused by MI. First, 12-lead ECG signals are reduced to 3-dimensional VCG signals, which are synthesized with Frank XYZ leads to build a hybrid 4-dimensional cardiac vector. Second, this vector is decomposed into a set of frequency subbands with a number of decomposition levels by using the TQWT method. Third, VMD is employed to decompose the subband of the 4-dimensional cardiac vector into different intrinsic modes, in which the first intrinsic mode contains the majority of the cardiac vector's energy and is considered to be the predominant intrinsic mode. It is selected to construct the reference variable for analysis. Fourth, phase space of the reference variable is reconstructed, in which the properties associated with the nonlinear cardiac system dynamics are preserved. Three-dimensional (3D) PSR together with Euclidean distance (ED) has been utilized to derive features, which demonstrate significant difference in cardiac system dynamics between normal (healthy) and MI cardiac vector signals. Fifth, cardiac system dynamics can be modeled and identified using neural networks, which employ the ED of 3D PSR of the reference variable as the input features. The difference of cardiac system dynamics between healthy control and MI cardiac vector is computed and used for the detection of MI based on a bank of estimators. Finally, data sets, which include conventional 12-lead and Frank XYZ leads ECG signal fragments from 148 patients with MI and 52 healthy controls from PTB diagnostic ECG database, are used for evaluation. By using the 10-fold cross-validation style, the achieved average classification accuracy is reported to be 97.98%. Currently, ST segment evaluation is one of the major and traditional ways for the MI detection. However, there exist weak or even undetectable ST segments in many ECG signals. Since the proposed method does not rely on the information of ST waves, it can serve as a complementary MI detection algorithm in the intensive care unit (ICU) of hospitals to assist the clinicians in confirming their diagnosis. Overall, our results verify that the proposed features may satisfactorily reflect cardiac system dynamics, and are complementary to the existing ECG features for automatic cardiac function analysis.

N2  - © 2020 IJSTR. Cardiovascular diseases correspond to the leading cause of death in the world and carry a high cost. In addition, the workforce of cardiologists is constantly decreasing. Therefore, automatic algorithms for the classification of heartbeats from electrocardiogram (ECG) registers have been developed. The classification of heartbeats from ECG records is a complex problem, with many edges and that, although several works have been developed that address the issue, it is not as clear which of them achieves better results, as there are discrepancies in the comparison and only those who adopt the same paradigm (intra-patient, inter-patient or patient-specific) are justly comparable. The ECG waveform has several deflections (waves). The analysis and automatic interpretation of this signal is often computer assisted using signal processing and pattern recognition techniques. This paper presents a theoretical review of deep learning and traditional methods based ECG classification.

N2  - BACKGROUND The correct interpretation of the ECG is pivotal for the accurate diagnosis of many cardiac abnormalities, and conventional computerized interpretation has not been able to reach physician-level accuracy in detecting (acute) cardiac abnormalities. This study aims to develop and validate a deep neural network for comprehensive automated ECG triage in daily practice. METHODS AND RESULTS We developed a 37-layer convolutional residual deep neural network on a data set of free-text physician-annotated 12-lead ECGs. The deep neural network was trained on a data set with 336.835 recordings from 142.040 patients and validated on an independent validation data set (n=984), annotated by a panel of 5 cardiologists electrophysiologists. The 12-lead ECGs were acquired in all noncardiology departments of the University Medical Center Utrecht. The algorithm learned to classify these ECGs into the following 4 triage categories: normal, abnormal not acute, subacute, and acute. Discriminative performance is presented with overall and category-specific concordance statistics, polytomous discrimination indexes, sensitivities, specificities, and positive and negative predictive values. The patients in the validation data set had a mean age of 60.4 years and 54.3% were men. The deep neural network showed excellent overall discrimination with an overall concordance statistic of 0.93 (95% CI, 0.92-0.95) and a polytomous discriminatory index of 0.83 (95% CI, 0.79-0.87). CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrates that an end-to-end deep neural network can be accurately trained on unstructured free-text physician annotations and used to consistently triage 12-lead ECGs. When further fine-tuned with other clinical outcomes and externally validated in clinical practice, the demonstrated deep learning-based ECG interpretation can potentially improve time to treatment and decrease healthcare burden.

N2  - © 2020 Elsevier B.V. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death worldwide, and coronary artery disease (CAD) is a major contributor. Early-stage CAD can progress if undiagnosed and left untreated, leading to myocardial infarction (MI) that may induce irreversible heart muscle damage, resulting in heart chamber remodeling and eventual congestive heart failure (CHF). Electrocardiography (ECG) signals can be useful to detect established MI, and may also be helpful for early diagnosis of CAD. For the latter especially, the ECG perturbations can be subtle and potentially misclassified during manual interpretation and/or when analyzed by traditional algorithms found in ECG instrumentation. For automated diagnostic systems (ADS), deep learning techniques are favored over conventional machine learning techniques, due to the automatic feature extraction and selection processes involved. This paper highlights various deep learning algorithms exploited for the classification of ECG signals into CAD, MI, and CHF conditions. The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), followed by combined CNN and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models, appear to be the most useful architectures for classification. A 16-layer LSTM model was developed in our study and validated using 10-fold cross-validation. A classification accuracy of 98.5% was achieved. Our proposed model has the potential to be a useful diagnostic tool in hospitals for the classification of abnormal ECG signals.

N2  - © 2019 Elsevier Ltd This study proposes a dedicated algorithm to estimate heart rate (HR) and respiratory rate (RR) from seismocardiogram (SCG). The proposed algorithm primarily consists of the wavelet decomposition (by db6 wavelet), the Fourier-based envelope detection and the time-averaged power spectral density (PSD) from the scalogram by complex Morlet wavelet. The records in the combined measurement of ECG, breathing and SCG (CEBS) database of PhysioNet are adopted to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm for HR and RR estimation. The performance was evaluated by intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and Bland-Altman's agreement analysis. The statistical results for HR estimation show good to excellent correlation between the approaches by SCG and ECG and also meet the maximal allowable error for the HR meter. As the quality of some respiratory signals in the CEBS database is not good for RR estimation, additional experiments have been conducted in the university laboratory under well-controlled procedure. The statistical results for the RR estimation in these experiments show good to excellent correlation between the approaches of RR estimation by SCG and respiratory signal. The RR estimation from SCG also meets the specification given in contemporary medical device. The proposed algorithm does not take the removal of motion artifact into account and thus SCG signal must be measured under resting state. From this study, SCG can be a potential tool to estimate HR and RR for monitoring the patient in intensive care unit (ICU) or monitoring the sleep quality in clinical setting or in daily life.

N2  - © 2020, The Author(s). Electrocardiography (ECG) is a key non-invasive diagnostic tool for cardiovascular diseases which is increasingly supported by algorithms based on machine learning. Major obstacles for the development of automatic ECG interpretation algorithms are both the lack of public datasets and well-defined benchmarking procedures to allow comparison s of different algorithms. To address these issues, we put forward PTB-XL, the to-date largest freely accessible clinical 12-lead ECG-waveform dataset comprising 21837 records from 18885 patients of 10 seconds length. The ECG-waveform data was annotated by up to two cardiologists as a multi-label dataset, where diagnostic labels were further aggregated into super and subclasses. The dataset covers a broad range of diagnostic classes including, in particular, a large fraction of healthy records. The combination with additional metadata on demographics, additional diagnostic statements, diagnosis likelihoods, manually annotated signal properties as well as suggested folds for splitting training and test sets turns the dataset into a rich resource for the development and the evaluation of automatic ECG interpretation algorithms.

N2  - © 2020 IEEE. This paper describes the design and implementation of an IoT-based smart doctor kit for a critical medical condition that can provide a versatile connection to IOT data that can help emergency health services such as Intensive Care Units (ICU).In recent technology, IoT gives base where the user can access all information regarding health from anywhere. Some of the Example where IOT are used such as Connected Car Smart Home, and Health Monitoring System. Now in recent days, the healthcare control system is necessary to regularly monitor the patient's physiological parameters. Heart Beat, body temp, ECG and Respiration are the physiological parameters of the body. The process of measuring these body parameters are called Health monitoring. Different sensors are used to monitor this data and this data is continuously monitored and send towards the internet server or on a mobile app. main advantage of health monitoring is that it reduces human error. The proposed model allows users to achieve better health-related risks and minimizes healthcare costs by collecting, recording, testing and distributing large data in real-time and perfectly. The idea behind this paper is to reduce the patient's worry about visiting a doctor every time. The time not only of patients but also of doctors is saved with the aid of this project proposal, so doctors can also help patients as much as possible in critical condition.

N2  - We estimate that as much as 5% of all recorded ECGs worldwide may, to some degree, suffer from poor signal quality or incorrect electrode positioning, which often interferes with correct interpretation of the ECG. Proper training of ECG technicians and regular inspection of signal quality is necessary to achieve a high standard. Due to the large amounts of ECGs recorded daily, we devised an automatic ECG quality inspection method based on the conversion of an ECG into a VCG and back again into a reconstructed ECG. Incorrectly placed electrodes as well as different types of noise can be detected with a high level of accuracy. We used this method to assess the quality of the ECGs in the learning set of the Physionet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2011, giving a correct interpretation of the quality of the ECGs of 92.2% which corresponded to a sensitivity of 97.0 and a specificity of 75.1%. © 2011 CCAL.

N2  - Background: Pneumonia is the leading infectious cause of death. Early deterioration and death commonly result from progressive sepsis, shock, respiratory failure, and cardiac complications. Recent data suggest that cardiac arrest may also be common, yet few previous studies have addressed this. Accordingly, we sought to characterize early cardiac arrest in patients who are hospitalized with coexisting pneumonia. Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of a multicenter cardiac arrest database, with data from >500 North American hospitals. We included in-hospital cardiac arrest events that occurred in community-dwelling adults with pneumonia within the first 72 h after hospital admission. We compared patient and event characteristics for patients with and without pneumonia. For patients with pneumonia, we also compared events according to event location. Results: We identified 4,453 episodes of early cardiac arrest in patients who were hospitalized with pneumonia. Among patients with preexisting pneumonia, only 36.5% were receiving mechanical ventilation and only 33.3% were receiving infusions of vasoactive drugs prior to cardiac arrest. Only 52.3% of patients on the ward were receiving ECG monitoring prior to cardiac arrest. Shockable rhythms were uncommon in all patients with pneumonia (ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation, 14.8%). Patients on the ward were significantly older than patients in the ICU. Conclusions: In patients with preexisting pneumonia, cardiac arrest may occur in the absence of preceding shock or respiratory failure. Physicians should be alert to the possibility of abrupt cardiopulmonary collapse, and future studies should address this possibility. The mechanism may involve myocardial ischemia, a maladaptive response to hypoxia, sepsis-related cardiomyopathy, or other phenomena. © 2012 American College of Chest Physicians.

N2  - This paper describes an algorithm for the automatic detection of systolic peaks in the Arterial Blood Pressure (ABP) signal. ABP waveform is rich in pathological information such as heart rate, systolic, mean and diastolic pressure therefore it is very important for clinical diagnosis in cardiology. The proposed algorithm deals with the development of energy based technique for the detection of systolic peaks in ABP signal that is of great importance in evaluating heart rate computation and serves as the basis for the extraction of other ABP features. The algorithm has been developed based on the window based energy analysis of ABP signal. This energy domain offers an easy interpretation of the ABP signal for the detection of systolic peaks in ABP signal. The ABP signal under test undergoes window based energy analysis by selecting a window of 100 ms duration. The window is shifted along time axis and the energy of samples falling in the succeeding window is calculated. The areas in ABP signal where systolic peaks are available appear as high energy zones. Window based amplitude threshold and interval threshold are applied to reject the unwanted peaks. The algorithm is easier to implement just after removal of the low frequency samples in ABP signal. ABP signals are downloaded from MGH/MF waveform database and algorithm has been developed on five minute segment of ABP signals. The method has been validated based on beat annotations of five minute segment of corresponding ECG signal from modified lead II. © 2011 IEEE.

N2  - Background Patients with in-hospital cardiopulmonary arrest (IHCA) precipitated by respiratory insufficiency often exhibit bradycardia before the arrest. We hypothesized that bradycardia frequently occurs in the 10. min preceding IHCA and is associated with poor outcomes when IHCA occurs outside the intensive care unit (ICU). Objectives: To determine the prevalence and association of antecedent bradycardia with outcome in adult patients with IHCA occurring outside the ICU.Methods We performed a retrospective cohort study among telemetry monitored adults with IHCA outside the ICU in a two-hospital health system between 2008 and 2010 with follow-up until their discharge or death in-hospital.We defined (1) IHCA as >1. min of chest compressions or trans-thoracic defibrillation, (2) Antecedent bradycardia as at least 2. min of continuous heart rate between 1 and 59 beats per minute in the 10. min preceding IHCA, and (3) ventricular tachyarrhythmia arrests as presence of sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia for >20. s in the 10. min preceding IHCA. Results: Of 98 IHCAs, 39 (39.8%) survived to hospital discharge. Of 98 IHCAs, 53 (54.1%) had antecedent bradycardia. After adjusting for potential confounders, antecedent bradycardia was associated with death prior to hospital discharge (adjusted OR = 3.80, 95%CI: 1.47-9.81, p= 0.006). Among patients with ventricular tachyarrhythmia arrests, antecedent bradycardia was associated with a higher risk of death (OR = 13.1, 95%CI 1.92-89.5, p= 0.009). Conclusions: Antecedent bradycardia occurred frequently and was associated with death prior to hospital discharge in non-ICU hospitalized adults on telemetry monitoring who developed IHCA. © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

N2  - A cross-sectional study was conducted to evaluate the electrocardiographic changes in 107 patients of acute organophosphorus poisoning admitted at casuality ward of MGM Medical College, Kisanganj from June 2007 to June 2010. Electrocardiographic changes were recorded before the administration of atropine. Prolonged Q-Tc interval was the commonest ECG abnormality, found in 67 patients (62.6%), followed by sinus tachycardia in 36 patients (33.6%). Sinus bradycardia was found in 33 patients (30.8%). Elevation of ST segment was seen in 27 patients (25.2%). T wave inversion was seen in 21 patients (19.6%). First-degree heart block (P-R interval >0.20 seconds) occurred in 9 cases (8.4%). Atrial fibrillation was seen in 5 patients (4.6%). Ventricular tachycardia was seen in 6 cases (5.6%) and ventricular premature complexes in 3 patients (2.8%). Of these 6 cases of ventricular tachycardia 1 responded to intravenous lignocaine, and the other 5 developed ventricular fibrillation leading to death despite other resuscitative measures. All the electrocardiographical abnormalities returned to normal before the patients were discharged. Seventeen patients died. The cause of death was ventricular fibrillation in 5 patients and non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema in others. In conclusion it can be said that ECG should be carefully recorded and analysed in all patients of acute organophosphorus poisoning, and depending upon these changes and other clinical and biochemical parameters, the patients should immediately be shifted to well equipped ICU for better care which will reduce the mortality rate caused by these highly lethal poisons.

N2  - Now many remote or underserved areas have brought forward a high demand for improving the quality of ECG interpretation. Telediagnosis can provide a feasible solution. However, even communities already equipped with ECG machines cannot communicate with a remote diagnostic center, because these machines lack interoperability. It can be predicted that the applicability and popularization of ECG telediagnosis could be greatly improved via developing high interoperable ECG machines and realizing a direct interaction between the machines and a remote diagnostic center. In this paper, a detail analysis on the flow of ECG telediagnosis is represented first. Several interactive transactions and a complete and reasonable interaction workflow of ECG machine are designed on the base of the analysis. The design has realized an automatic acquisition of patient information and the transmission of a complete ECG record as well as a diagnostic report. We have created an ECG machine based on the design presented and developed a Web Service named TeleECGService, through which a direct interaction between an ECG machine and a remote diagnostic center can be achieved. An ECG remote diagnosis system based such high interoperable ECG machines has been put into use in a hospital in Shanxi Province of China. © 2011 IEEE.

N2  - During the process of measurement, the ECG signal suffers from several noises, artifacts and interferences, which reduce its quality. Automatic signal quality estimation could permit indentify when the level of noise is high to avoid wrong ECG interpretation. With this aim, several methods have been proposed in the literature. This work assesses eleven different methods for estimation of ECG signal quality available in literature. In addition, three new methods are proposed. These methods were evaluated in a simulated database containing ECGs with different types and levels of noise with SNR values ranging from -20 to 20 dB. From all the quality estimators studied, one novel parameter: Kurtosis, gave the best performance overall the tests. It gave high correlation with the signal SNR (0.95±0.00) and high correlation with the output of a beat detector (Positive Predictivity=0.97±0.00) and high resolution in time (10 seconds of signal length). However kurtosis did not have a high dynamic range. Some methods require some knowledge about the ECG signal (like the position of the R peak) and therefore are not suitable for applications with high levels of noise. © 2011 CCAL.

N2  - Although electrical impedance tomography (EIT) for ventilation monitoring is on the verge of clinical trials, pulmonary perfusion imaging with EIT remains a challenge, especially in spontaneously breathing subjects. In anticipation of more research on this subject, we believe a thorough review is called for. In this paper, findings related to the physiological origins and electrical characteristics of this signal are summarized, highlighting properties that are particularly relevant to EIT. The perfusion impedance change signal is significantly smaller in amplitude compared with the changes due to ventilation. Therefore, the hardware used for this purpose must be more sensitive and more resilient to noise. In previous works, some signal- or image-processing methods have been required to separate these two signals. Three different techniques are reviewed in this paper, including the ECG-gating method, frequency-domain- filtering-based methods and a principal-component-analysis-based method. In addition, we review a number of experimental studies on both human and animal subjects that employed EIT for perfusion imaging, with promising results in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE) and pulmonary arterial hypertension as well as other potential applications. In our opinion, PE is most likely to become the main focus for perfusion EIT in the future, especially for heavily instrumented patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). © 2012 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.

N2  - Background: Vectorcardiogram (VCG) signals monitor both spatial and temporal cardiac electrical activities along three orthogonal planes of the body. However, the absence of spatiotemporal resolution in conventional VCG representations is a major impediment for medical interpretation and clinical usage of VCG. This is especially so because time-domain features of 12-lead ECG, instead of both spatial and temporal characteristics of VCG, are widely used for the automatic assessment of cardiac pathological patterns.Materials and methods: We present a novel representation approach that captures critical spatiotemporal heart dynamics by displaying the real time motion of VCG cardiac vectors in a 3D space. Such a dynamic display can also be realized with only one lead ECG signal (e.g., ambulatory ECG) through an alternative lag-reconstructed ECG representation from nonlinear dynamics principles. Furthermore, the trajectories are color coded with additional dynamical properties of space-time VCG signals, e.g., the curvature, speed, octant and phase angles to enhance the information visibility.Results: In this investigation, spatiotemporal VCG signal representation is used to characterize various spatiotemporal pathological patterns for healthy control (HC), myocardial infarction (MI), atrial fibrillation (AF) and bundle branch block (BBB). The proposed color coding scheme revealed that the spatial locations of the peak of T waves are in the Octant 6 for the majority (i.e., 74 out of 80) of healthy recordings in the PhysioNet PTB database. In contrast, the peak of T waves from 31.79% (117/368) of MI subjects are found to remain in Octant 6 and the rest (68.21%) spread over all other octants. The spatiotemporal VCG signal representation is shown to capture the same important heart characteristics as the 12-lead ECG plots and more.Conclusions: Spatiotemporal VCG signal representation is shown to facilitate the characterization of space-time cardiac pathological patterns and enhance the automatic assessment of cardiovascular diseases. © 2012 Yang et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

N2  - The electrocardiogram (ECG) is the recording of the heart's electrical activity from the surface of the body and has been worldwide used in routine medical practice since the last century. This is a first-rate tool for a rapid interpretation of cardiac rhythm and for assessment and immediate therapeutic management in patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome, which is a clinical entity that includes unstable angina and acute myocardial infarction with and without ST-segment elevation. Currently, electrocardiographs from various manufacturers are capable of providing automatic diagnosis of ECGs, but there are few published studies about the performance of these equipments. The objective of this paper is to evaluate the performance of an interpretive electrocardiograph in order to determine their suitability for use in a computer system that uses the medical history information obtained by the general practitioner and the electrocardiographic report emitted by the equipment evaluated to aid the diagnosis of acute coronary syndromes, when the patient is not treated by cardiologists. We used an interpretive electrocardigraph Nihon Kohden Cardiofax 9620. The electrocardiograph simulator Metron PS 420 was the choice for the simulated tests, and also we compared the performance of the Cardiofax with a telemedicine system available in a semi-rural area in Brazil. The tests resulted in 93.8% sensitivity and 83.3% specificity that were considered satisfactory in clinical situations compatible with acute myocardial ischemia, validating their use in an artificial intelligence system for the diagnosis of ACS.

N2  - Background. Hybrid PET/CT allows for acquisition of cardiac PET and coronary CT angiography (CCTA) in one session. However, PET and CCTA are acquired with differing breathing protocols and require software registration. We aimed to validate automatic correction for breathing misalignment between PET and CCTA acquired on hybrid scanner. Methods. Single-session hybrid PET/CT studies of rest/stress 13N-ammonia PET and CCTA in 32 consecutive patients were considered. Automated registration of PET left ventricular (LV) surfaces with CCTA volumes was evaluated by comparing with expert manual alignment by two observers. Results. The average initial misalignments between the position of LV on PET and CCTA were 27.2 ± 11.8, 13.3 ± 11.5, and 14.3 ± 9.1 mm in x, y, and z axes on rest, and 26.3 ± 10.2, 11.1 ± 9.5, and 11.7 ± 7.1 mm in x, y, and z axes on stress, respectively. The automated PETCCTA co-registration had 95% agreement as judged visually. Compared with expert manual alignment, the translation errors of the algorithm were 5.3 ± 2.8 mm (rest) and 6.0 ± 3.5 mm (stress). 3D visualization of combined coronary vessel anatomy and hypoperfusion from PET could be made without further manual adjustments. Conclusion. Software co-registration of CCTA and PET myocardial perfusion imaging on hybrid PET/CT scanners is necessary, but can be performed automatically, facilitating integrated 3D display on PET/CT.

N2  - Real-time remote health monitoring systems are experiencing tremendous advancement resulting from improvements in low power, reliable sensors; yet they are still constrained to low-level interpretation. Automatic data analysis continues to be a tedious task due to a lack of efficient, reliable platforms for data analysis. In this paper, we present a system for monitoring patients remotely by emphasizing the strength of Complex Event Processing (CEP) and Situation Awareness. In this approach, the system makes decisions in a declarative way, which helps medical experts to understand the situation in a more realistic manner. The primary objective of this paper is to explicate the different components inside the system. To verify the technical feasibility of each component, the proposed system is implemented and tested using ECG data. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

N2  - Respiratory activity is an important parameter in clinical monitoring used in a wide range of areas like intensive care units (ICU), sports performance studies and sleep studies. Common methods measure the respiratory activity by means of facemasks (FM) or Plethysmographie belts strapped around chest and/or abdomen. FMs are often too obtrusive when worn for a longer period of time while Plethysmographie belts lack the necessary accuracy for acquiring the exact volume of air in- and exhaled and are prone to error from artefacts. It has been shown that respiratory induced modulations can be found in other vital signs like Electrocardiogram (ECG), Photoplethysmogram (PPG) and arterial blood pressure (ABP). It is possible to use these signals to derive respiration without the need for additional sensors. In this paper we propose to combine these cardiac signals and compensate for the pulse arrival time to derive the respiratory activity. Employing principal component analysis (PCA) to extract respiration from combined ECG, PPG and ABP can improve the results over single signal approaches. © 2012 by Walter de Gruyter Berlin Boston.

N2  - Newly devices allow the analysis and collection of very long-term electrocardiogram (ECG). However, associated with this devices and long-term signal, are artefacts that conduce to misleading interpretations and diagnosis. So, new developments over automatic ECG classification are needed for a reliable interpretation. The feasibility of the cardiac systems is one of the main concerns, once they are currently used as diagnosis or help systems. In this project, an artefact detection algorithm is developed, dividing the time-series in intervals of signal and artefact. The algorithm is based on the assumption that, if the analysed frame is signal, there is not an abrupt alteration over consecutive short windows. So, the time-series is divided in consecutive nonoverlapped short windows. Over these windows, it is calculated the time-series standard deviation, the maximum and minimum slope. A threshold-based rule is applied, and the algorithm reveals that, in mean, it is verified a 99.29% of correctly classified signal and only 0.71% of signal erroneously classified. Over the results obtained, the algorithm seems to present good results, however it is needed its validation in a wider and representative sample with segments marked as artefact by multiple specialists.

N2  - Objectives: To improve screening and quantification of subclinical atherosclerosis in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes (T1D), we investigated the distribution of cardiovascular risk factors (cRFs) and carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) percentiles with regard to sex-specific differences. Methods: This cross-sectional analysis included clinical parameters, blood lipids, and B-mode ultrasound examination of the bilateral mean cIMT using an automatic contour identification procedure combined with computerized analysis. Results: A total of 270 patients were eligible for evaluation (126 females, mean age 13.7 yr; 144 males, mean age 13.8 yr). In the total group, cIMT was significantly related to sex and diabetes duration but not to age. In males, cIMT was significantly higher than in females and sex-specific cIMT percentiles were calculated. Both pulse pressure and diabetes duration in boys and low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), and diabetes duration in girls showed a significant association with cIMT. Conclusions: On the basis of sex differences of cRFs and cIMT in pediatric T1D, the assessment of sex-specific IMT percentiles facilitates a differentiated interpretation of subclinical atherosclerosis. The underlying diabetes and additional cRFs seem to be more important determinants of intima-media thickening than age. To improve the comparability of IMT measurements of relevant studies, the international harmonization of IMT measurements should be aimed for. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

N2  - An electrical impedance tomography (EIT) system can visualize conductivity and permittivity distributions inside the human body from measured boundary voltages induced by externally injected currents. We have developed a fully parallel multi-frequency EIT system called the KHU Mark2.5. It is based on an impedance measurement module (IMM) comprising a current source, a voltmeter and a calibration circuit. Each IMM is independent and can calibrate its own current source and voltmeter through an automatic self-calibration procedure. We found that the output impedance values of all current sources are greater than 1MΩ at the chosen frequencies. The CMRR is around 96 dB and the voltmeter SNR is between 80 and 85 dB depending. To increase spatial resolution of conductivity and permittivity images, we can cascade multiple EIT systems to form a system with a larger number of channels. They are synchronized by clock synchronization circuits. Physiological events such as cardiac and respiratory functions alter electrical tissue properties. To correlate such events with EIT images, we can perform a biosignal-gated EIT imaging. We can improve interpretation of EIT images by incorporating real-time ECG and respiration signals into EIT images. This may allow us to separate fast cardiac events and slow respiratory events from reconstructed EIT images and also improve the SNR by signal-gated data averaging We present the performance of the KHU Mark2.5 system with experimental results of animal.

N2  - A modern intensive care unit (ICU) has automated analysis systems that depend on continuous uninterrupted real time monitoring of physiological signals such as electrocardiogram (ECG), arterial blood pressure (ABP), and photo-plethysmogram (PPG). These signals are often corrupted by noise, artifacts, and missing data. We present an automated learning framework for real time reconstruction of corrupted multi-parameter nonstationary quasiperiodic physiological signals. The key idea is to learn a patient-specific model of the relationships between signals, and then reconstruct corrupted segments using the information available in correlated signals. We evaluated our method on MIT-BIH arrhythmia data, a two-channel ECG dataset with many clinically significant arrhythmias, and on the CinC challenge 2010 data, a multi-parameter dataset containing ECG, ABP, and PPG. For each, we evaluated both the residual distance between the original signals and the reconstructed signals, and the performance of a heartbeat classifier on a reconstructed ECG signal. At an SNR of 0 dB, the average residual distance on the CinC data was roughly 3% of the energy in the signal, and on the arrhythmia database it was roughly 16%. The difference is attributable to the large amount of diversity in the arrhythmia database. Remarkably, despite the relatively high residual difference, the classification accuracy on the arrhythmia database was still 98%, indicating that our method restored the physiologically important aspects of the signal. © 2012 Ganeshapillai and Guttag; licensee Springer.

N2  - Measurements of the Q-T interval are less reliable in children than in adults. Identification of superior diagnostic tools is warranted. This study aimed to investigate whether a vectorcardiogram (VCG) recorded from three orthogonal leads (X, Y, Z) according to Frank is superior to a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) in providing a correct long Q-T syndrome (LQTS) diagnosis in children. This LQTS group consisted of 35 genetically confirmed carriers of mutations in the KCNQ1 (n = 29) and KCNH2 (n = 6) genes. The control group consisted of 35 age- and gender-matched healthy children. The mean age was 7 years in the LQTS group and 6.7 years in the control group (range, 0.5-16 years). The corrected Q-T interval (QTc) was measured manually (QTman) by one author (A.W.). The 12-lead ECG automatic measurements (QTECG) and interpretation (QTInterpret) of QTc were performed with the Mac5000 (GE Medical System), and the VCG automatic measurements (QTVCG) were performed with the Mida1000, CoroNet (Ortivus AB, Sweden). By either method, a QTc longer than 440 ms was considered prolonged and indicative of LQTS. Of the 35 children with genetically confirmed LQTS, 30 (86 %) received a correct diagnosis using QTVCG, 29 (82 %) using QTman, 24 (69 %) using QTECG, and 17 (49 %) using QTInterpret. Specificity was 0.80 for QTVCG, 0.83 for QTman, 0.77 for QTECG, and 0.83 for QT Interpret. The VCG automatic measurement of QTc seems to be a better predictor of LQTS than automatic measurement and interpretation of 12-lead ECG. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

N2  - Automatic interpretation of electrocardiography provides a non-invasive and inexpensive technique to analyze the heart activity for different cardiac conditions. The emergence of smartphones and wireless networks has made it possible to perform continuous Holter monitoring on patients or potential patients. Recently, much attention has been paid to the development of the monitoring methodologies of heart activity, which include both the detection of heartbeats in electrocardiography and the classification of types of heartbeats. However, many studies have focused on classifying limited types of heartbeats. We propose a system for classification into 17 types of heartbeats. This system consists of two parts, the detection and classification of heartbeats. The system detects heartbeats through repetitive features and classifies them using a A-nearest neighbor algorithm. Features such as the QRS complex and P wave were accurately extracted using the Pan-Tompkins algorithm. For the classifier, the distance metric is an adaptation of locally weighted regression. The system was validated with the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database. The system achieved a sensitivity of 97.22 % and a specificity of 97.4 % for heartbeat detection. The system also achieved a sensitivity of 97.1 % and a specificity of 96.9 % for classification. © 2013 IEEE.

N2  - Electroencephalogram (EEG) examination plays a very important role in the diagnosis of disorders related to epilepsy in clinic. However, epileptic EEG is often contaminated with lots of artifacts such as electrocardiogram (ECG), electromyogram (EMG) and electrooculogram (EOG). These artifacts confuse EEG interpretation, while rejecting EEG segments containing artifacts probably results in a substantial data loss and it is very timeconsuming. The purpose of this study is to develop a novel algorithm for removing artifacts from epileptic EEG automatically. The collected multi-channel EEG data are decomposed into statistically independent components with Independent Component Analysis (ICA). Then temporal and spectral features of each independent component, including Hurst exponent, skewness, kurtosis, largest Lyapunov exponent and frequency-band energy extracted with wavelet packet decomposition, are calculated to quantify the characteristics of different artifact components. These features are imported into trained support vector machine to determine whether the independent components represent EEG activity or artifactual signals. Finally artifact-free EEGs are obtained by reconstructing the signal with artifact-free components. The method is evaluated with EEG recordings acquired from 15 epilepsy patients. Compared with previous work, the proposed method can remove artifacts such as baseline drift, ECG, EMG, EOG, and power frequency interference automatically and efficiently, while retaining important features for epilepsy diagnosis such as interictal spikes and ictal segments. © VIBROENGINEERING.

N2  - A 62-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital for removal of hydatid cyst from the liver. Intraoperatively, the patient suddenly became hypotensive with tachycardia and ST segment elevation. There was no erythema, bronchospasm or desaturation. Anaesthetic agents were stopped and oxygen fraction was increased. In view of the recurrence of hypotension, she was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) without completion of surgery. She was successfully resuscitated and acute myocardial infarction was ruled out. She was managed for the possibility of anaphylaxis with hydration, dopamine, antihistamin and hydrocortisone. After stabilisation, she was taken back to the theatre and the cyst was then removed. Histopathology confirmed hydatid disease of the liver. The patient was discharged from the ICU and then from the hospital in 6 days. Anaphylaxis secondary to hydatid disease is uncommon; however, the possibility of such a diagnosis in all patients with non-ruptured hydatid disease in the endemic areas that develop intraoperative shock should be considered.

N2  - Myocardial infarction which happens post operatively belongs to surgery is due to myocardial infarctions with hemodynamic instability. The mortality is increased and reduce the survival of patients undergoing CABG surgery that depends on revascularization and ejection fraction. This study was designed to determine the electrocardiogram changes in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft in Afshar cardiovascular research center, Yazd, Iran. In a before-after study, 200 patients who were undergone Coronary Artery Bypass Graft surgery, from October 2001 to 0ctober 2002 in Afshar Cardiovascular Research Center in Yazd, Iran were investigated.Patient s selection was done by Haphazard method that including 145 men and 55 women. Among them 21 patients were treated with off-pump surgery and the other 179 ones treated with on-pump CABG surgery. An electrocardiogram for each patient was done once before surgery, also immediately after surgery (that was in intensive care unit after CABG surgery) and finally when they were discharged from hospital.ECGs were investigated for Q and T waves in Lateral, Anterior and Inferior segments and also left anterior hemi block, left posterior hemi block, left bundle branch block and right bundle branch block. In lateral leads 22 patients had T - depression in preoperative evaluations which was seen in 23 patients in immediately after operation and in 21 patients when they were discharged that it was not significant by chi-square test (P-Value > 0.05). Pathologic Q wave were found in 13 patients with one vessel obstruction category in inferior leads while 28 patients were reported for the same wave with three vessels. In three categorized ejection fraction, 2 patients were found with pathologic Q wave in EF between 35 to 45% and one patient above 45%. In conclusion,We found that Pathologic Q wave and Reversed T in lateral, anterior and inferior leads did not changed significantly in pre and post operation investigations in our study. In this survey among conductive disorders only LBBB changed significantly between pre operation and ICU investigation and also between ICU and discharge-time ones which it may because of cardiac inflammation and edema in CABG procedure especially in first two days after surgery and it can be better just with rest. © IDOSI Publications, 2012.

N2  - Background: This study proposed a fast and fully automatic calibration system to suppress the dark banding artifacts in balanced steady-state free precession (bSSFP) cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) at 3.0 T. Methods. Twenty-one healthy volunteers (18 men, 3 women; mean age 24.9 years) participated in this study after providing institutionally approved consent. The optimal frequency was obtained using sweep scans of transition-band low flip-angle bSSFP (bSSFP-L), performed with three conditions: breath-hold plus electrocardiography (ECG) triggering (BH + ECG), breath-hold only (BH), and free breathing (FB). A real-time feedback system was implemented to allow the performing of bSSFP-L calibration scanning and conventional cine bSSFP within one breath-hold. For each scan condition, the optimal phase was estimated using 20-point and 10-point spline fitting. Results: Linear regression analysis indicated high correlation between the optimal phases obtained using BH and FB and those obtained using BH + ECG (R§ssup§2§esup§ = 0.91 to 0.98, n = 21). The optimal phases obtained using 10-point datasets showed high correlation with the 20-point BH + ECG datasets (R§ssup§2§ esup§ = 0.92 to 0.99, n = 21); although the within-subject coefficient of variation (wsCV) was larger using 10-point fitting. The variation of repeated measurements was largest with FB acquisition and smallest with BH + ECG acquisition. The optimal frequency obtained by offline calculation and by real-time feedback calibration significantly reduced dark-band artifacts in cine bSSFP images (both p <.01). Conclusions: The proposed real-time feedback calibration method for bSSFP imaging is rapid and fully automatic. This method could greatly reduce dark-band artifacts in bSSFP images and facilitate clinical CMR at 3.0 T. © 2013 Tang et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

N2  - Sudden cardiac death in young athletes is a devastating event. Thus, screening programs have been proposed to prevent sudden cardiac death in young athletes. Still, the mortality rates and the causes of death differ among young adults and children. Children have a considerably lower incidence of sudden cardiac death. Data comparing athletes and non-athletes in childhood are lacking, although 40% to 50% of the sudden cardiac death in this age group seems to be related to exercise. Screening programs, including the medical history and a physical exam, are not very sensitive nor specific and will result in important numbers of false-positives and false-negatives. Especially the interpretation of an electrocardiogram (ECG) in children is different from the ECG in adults, with less accurate diagnoses as a consequence. Secondary prevention by means of a widespread education of simple resuscitation techniques and the use of automatic external defibrillators, if available, will probably save as many lives as any screening program. Sufficient data are lacking to support a general preparticipation screening of competitive children with their medical history, a physical exam and an ECG. Still, the impact of such a program together with secondary preventive measures should be evaluated in large prospective studies.

N2  - Objectives: To compare image quality in coronary artery computed tomography angiography (cCTA) using reconstructions with automated phase detection and Reconstructions computed with Identical Filling of the heart (RIF). Methods: Seventy-four patients underwent ECG-gated dual source CT (DSCT) between November 2009 and July 2010 for suspected coronary heart disease (n=35), planning of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (n=34) or evaluation of ventricular function (n=5). Image data sets by the RIF formula and automated phase detection were computed and evalutated with the AHA 15-segment model and a 5-grade Likert scale (1: poor, 5: excellent quality). Subgroups regarding rhythm (sinus rhythm = SR; arrhythmia = ARR) and potential premedication were evaluated by a per-segment, per-vessel and per-patient analysis. Results: RIF significantly improved image quality in 10 of 15 coronary segments (P<0.05). More diagnostic segments were provided by RIF regarding the entire cohort (n=693 vs. 590, P<0.001) and all of the subgroups (e.g. ARR: n=143 vs. 72, P<0.001). In arrhythmic patients (n=19), more diagnostic vessels (e.g. LAD: n=10 vs. 3; P<0.014) and complete data sets (n=7 vs. 1; P<0.001) were produced. Conclusions: RIF reconstruction is superior to automatic diastolic non-edited reconstructions, especially in arrhythmic patients. RIF theory provides a physiological approach for determining the optimal image reconstruction point in ECG-gated CT angiography. Key Points: • Conventional CT coronary angiography suffers from numerous artefacts in patients with irregular rhythms • Coronary computed tomography angiograms (cCTA) were reconstructed with identical cardiac filling (RIF) • RIF reconstructions provide improved image quality compared to non-edited standard reconstructions • RIF theory links physiology with cardiac CT. © European Society of Radiology 2012.

Design: A prospective, observational clinical study. Setting: A medical ICU at the University of Tokyo Hospital in Tokyo, Japan. Participants: All patients who were admitted directly to the ICU, aged ≥18 years, and not refused active treatment were registered between January and February 2012. Methods: The alarms, alarm settings, alarm messages, waveforms and video recordings were acquired in real time and saved continuously. All alarms were annotated with respect to technical and clinical validity. Results: 18 ICU patients were monitored. During 2697 patient-monitored hours, 11 591 alarms were annotated. Only 740 (6.4%) alarms were considered to be clinically relevant. The monitoring devices that triggered alarms the most often were the direct measurement of arterial pressure (33.5%), oxygen saturation (24.2%), and electrocardiogram (22.9%). The numbers of relevant alarms were 12.4% (direct measurement of arterial pressure), 2.4% (oxygen saturation) and 5.3% (electrocardiogram). Positive correlations were established between patient clinical severities and the proportion of relevant alarms. The total number of irrelevant alarms could be reduced by 21.4% by evaluating their technical relevance. Conclusions: We demonstrated that (1) the types of devices that alarm the most frequently were direct measurements of arterial pressure, oxygen saturation and ECG, and most of those alarms were not clinically relevant; (2) the proportion of clinically relevant alarms decreased as the patients' status improved and (3) the irrelevance alarms can be considerably reduced by evaluating their technical relevance.

N2  - Objectives: To test the hypothesis that instituting a process of routine daily review of rhythm alarms in non-cardiac patients in the pediatric intensive care unit would yield clinically important disturbances that would otherwise go undetected. Study design: A prospective observational study was performed over a consecutive 28-day period. Total bedside monitor alarms, rhythm alarms, and heart rate (HR) trends were recorded. Rhythm alarm recordings were reviewed independently by two study team members. Medical records for patients with critical arrhythmias were reviewed to evaluate for prior knowledge of the event and to correlate with clinical data. Results: We evaluated 86 patients (343 patient-days). There were 54 656 total monitor alarms (159.3 alarms/patient-day), of which 19 970 (37%) were rhythm alarms, including 4032 (20%) critical arrhythmias. Fifty-six percent of the critical alarms were artifactual. Seventeen of the 1786 ventricular tachycardia alarms represented true episodes that occurred in 5 patients. Two patients' care were altered as a result of detection of the arrhythmia in the review process. Eight hundred sixty-five (98%) of the 883 true critical alarms reviewed were for extreme HR. Eighty-three percent (5172) of the 6239 true non-critical alarms reviewed were HR alarms. Conclusions: Daily review of rhythm alarms improves detection of clinically relevant arrhythmias in non-cardiac pediatric intensive care unit patients. Copyright © 2013 Mosby Inc.

N2  - Even though it might be beneficial to have continuous baseline data upfront, today's hospitalized patients are put on a vital signs monitor not earlier than they become bed-ridden. The aim of this study is to show the feasibility of a broader monitoring concept, embracing many more subjects, by monitoring contactless vital signs with sensors embedded in non-ICU settings. In order to conduct the experiments, a system was designed to measure electrocardiograms (ECG) unobtrusively by capacitive sensors in various patient fitments e.g., stretchers, hospital-beds and wheelchairs. Contact ECG and contactless ECG measurements by shielded textile electrodes are contrasted to each other to display the potential of contactless monitoring. Our experiments demonstrate that the contactless ECG recordings are of sufficient quality and later used for further standard ECG analysis like QRS-complex detection. We believe that our results are motivating for the potential future care facility featuring a personal, non-obtrusive and yet permanent health monitoring system. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

N2  - High-grade aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage patients are monitored in the ICU for up to 21 days, as they are at risk for complications such as vasospasm of cerebral arteries, cardiac arrhythmias and neurogenic stress cardiomyopathy. The diagnosis of these treatable complications is often delayed by the limitations of monitoring capabilities. We applied computational analysis to a cohort of 24 aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage patients, to identify heart rate variability and ECG frequency profiles that may be potential biomarkers of severe vasospasm, reversible cardiomyopathy and death. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

N2  - The patients in the ICU need a constant monitoring of their ECG, Temperature, BP and heart beat. This project is a working model, which incorporates sensors to measure important parameters namely the Temperature, Respiratory temperature, BP, Heart Beat and ECG. The sensors are interfaced to computer, so that the condition of a patient can be analyzed by doctors in any part of the hospital wherever they are. Whenever there is an abnormality felt by the patient, the particular patient will give an alarm signal, by which the doctor can rush to the patient. Even when the patient is in an unconscious condition, all the parameters will be sensed and doctor will be cautioned, thus it reduces doctor's workload and also gives more accurate results. Our project is a working model which incorporates sensors to measure all these parameters like body temperature, Respiratory Temp, Saline Status, ECG and Heart Beat rate and transfer it to the computer, so that the patient condition can be analyzed to by doctors in any part of the hospital wherever they are. Thus it reduces doctors work load and also gives more accurate results. © IDOSI Publications, 2013.

N2  - Background: We sought to determine if monitoring heart rate variability (HRV) would enable preclinical detection of secondary complications after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Methods: We studied 236 SAH patients admitted within the first 48 h of bleed onset, discharged after SAH day 5, and had continuous electrocardiogram records available. The diagnosis and date of onset of infections and DCI events were prospectively adjudicated and documented by the clinical team. Continuous ECG was collected at 240 Hz using a high-resolution data acquisition system. The Tompkins-Hamilton algorithm was used to identify R-R intervals excluding ectopic and abnormal beats. Time, frequency, and regularity domain calculations of HRV were generated over the first 48 h of ICU admission and 24 h prior to the onset of each patient's first complication, or SAH day 6 for control patients. Clinical prediction rules to identify infection and DCI events were developed using bootstrap aggregation and cost-sensitive meta-classifiers. Results: The combined infection and DCI model predicted events 24 h prior to clinical onset with high sensitivity (87 %) and moderate specificity (66 %), and was more sensitive than models that predicted either infection or DCI. Models including clinical and HRV variables together substantially improved diagnostic accuracy (AUC 0.83) compared to models with only HRV variables (AUC 0.61). Conclusions: Changes in HRV after SAH reflect both delayed ischemic and infectious complications. Incorporation of concurrent disease severity measures substantially improves prediction compared to using HRV alone. Further research is needed to refine and prospectively evaluate real-time bedside HRV monitoring after SAH. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media.

N2  - Virtual Reality (VR) is increasingly being used in combination with psycho-physiological measures to improve assessment of distress in mental health research and therapy. However, the analysis and interpretation of multiple physiological measures is time consuming and requires specific skills, which are not available to most clinicians. To address this issue, we designed and developed a Decision Support System (DSS) for automatic classification of stress levels during exposure to VR environments. The DSS integrates different biosensor data (ECG, breathing rate, EEG) and behavioral data (body gestures correlated with stress), following a training process in which self-rated and clinical-rated stress levels are used as ground truth. Detected stress events for each VR session are reported to the therapist as an aggregated value (ranging from 0 to 1) and graphically displayed on a diagram accessible by the therapist through a web-based interface.© 2014 The authors and IOS Press.

N2  - Sudden cardiac death in young athletes is a devastating event. Screening programs have been proposed to prevent sudden cardiac death in young athletes. Mortality rates and causes of death differ among young adults and children. Children have a considerably lower incidence of sudden cardiac death. Data lack to compare athletes and non-athletes in childhood, but 40-50 % of sudden cardiac death in this age group seems to be related to exercise. Screening programs including history and physical exam are not very sensitive or specific and will result in important numbers of false-positives and false-negatives. Especially, interpretation of ECG in children is different from ECG in adults, with less accurate diagnoses as a consequence. Secondary prevention by widespread education of simple resuscitation techniques and use of automatic external defibrillators if available will probably save as many lives as any screening program. Conclusion: Sufficient data are lacking to support general preparticipation screening with history, physical exam, and ECG in competitive children. Nevertheless, the impact of such a program, together with secondary preventive measures, should be evaluated in large prospective studies. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.

N2  - The paper presents results of interactive hidden survey of disease-related relevance of standard rest ECG diagnostic parameters. The interactive interface methodology revealed human expert preferences for a particular subset of diagnostic results in context of actual patient disease. We applied a custom-build software randomizing the appearance of the interface, stimulating the expert to a knowledgebased reaction and recording his interaction with the computer. The acquisition of interaction data works behind the standard 12-leads ECG interpretation software and does not interfere with the diagnosis. Only few mouse clicks are recorded while the expert is selecting the ECG diagnostic statements necessary for a final report. Using the interaction recording module we captured 5127 events of decision making, together with patient-anonymized human-annotated examinations in eleven cardiologists' offices. These records yield statistically justified values of parameter's relevance in 16 most common heart diseases and approximate values in case of other 13. The hierarchy of ECG diagnostic parameters may be applied to adaptation of automatic interpretation, to optimization of data transmission and to objective, disease-oriented quality assessment of ECG processing. © 2014 et al.; licensee Cardiology Academic Press.

N2  - Purpose: To demonstrate the feasibility of comprehensive assessment of cardiac arrhythmias by combining body surface electrocardiographic (ECG) mapping (BSM) and imaging. Materials and Methods: This study was approved by the institutional review board, and all patients gave written informed consent. Twenty-seven patients referred for electrophysiologic procedures in the context of ventricular tachycardia (VT) (n = 9), Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome (n = 2), atrial fibrillation (AF) (n = 13), or scar-related ventricular fibrillation (VF) (n = 3) were examined. Patients underwent BSM and imaging with multidetector computed tomography (CT) (n = 12) and/or delayed enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging (n = 23). BSM was performed by using a 252-electrode vest that enabled the computation of epicardial electrograms from body surface potentials. The epicardial geometry used for BSM was registered to the epicardial geometry segmented from imaging data by using an automatic algorithm. The output was a three-dimensional cardiac model that integrated cardiac anatomy, myocardial substrate, and epicardial activation. Results: Acquisition, segmentation, and registration were feasible in all patients. In VT, this enabled a noninvasive assessment of the arrhythmia mechanism and its location with respect to the myocardial substrate, coronary vessels, and phrenic nerve. In WPW syndrome, this enabled understanding of complex accessory pathways resistant to previous ablation. In AF and VF, this enabled the noninvasive assessment of arrhythmia mechanisms and the analysis of rotor trajectories with respect to the myocardial substrate. In all patients, three-dimensional models were successfully integrated in navigation systems and used to guide mapping and ablation. Conclusion: By combining information on anatomy, substrate, and electrical activation, the fusion of BSM and imaging enables comprehensive noninvasive assessment of cardiac arrhythmias, with potential applications for diagnosis, prognosis, and ablation targeting. © RSNA, 2013.

N2  - © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht. To investigate the image quality and the minimum required radiation dose for automatic tube potential selection (ATPS) in dual-source computed tomography (DSCT) coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA). Three hundred twenty-five consecutive patients (153 men and 172 women) undergoing CCTA were assigned to either the ATPS group (n = 172) or the control group (n = 153); the control group underwent imaging at a constant current of 120 kV. All patients were scanned in either prospectively ECG-triggered high-pitch helical mode or sequential mode. The subjective image quality score, attenuation, image noise, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), volume CT dose index (CTDIvol), and effective dose (ED) were compared between the two groups with the Student t test or Mann–Whitney U test. The subjective image quality score was not significantly different between the two groups. Imaging noise and attenuation were both significantly higher in the ATPS group than in the control group (imaging noise: 25.6 ± 7.6 versus 15.8 ± 4.0 HU, P < 0.001; attenuation: 559.6 ± 142.0 versus 412.5 ± 64.3 HU, P < 0.001). SNR and CNR were significantly lower in the ATPS group than in the control group (SNR: 23.21 ± 7.40 versus 27.71 ± 8.25, P < 0.001; CNR: 27.81 ± 8.44 versus 33.94 ± 9.69, P < 0.001). ED was significantly lower in the ATPS group than in the control group (ED: 1.25 ± 1.24 versus 2.19 ± 1.77 mSv, P < 0.001). For both groups, ED was significantly lower in the high-pitch mode than in the sequential mode. The use of ATPS for CCTA significantly reduced the radiation dose while maintaining image quality.

N2  - Introduction: Computerized interpretation of the prehospital electrocardiogram (ECG) is increasingly being used in the basic life support (BLS) ambulance setting to reduce delays to treatment for patients suspected of ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Objectives: To estimate 1) predictive values of computerized prehospital 12-lead ECG interpretation for STEMI and 2) additional on-scene time for 12-lead ECG acquisition. Methods: Over a 2-year period, 1,247 ECGs acquired by primary care paramedics for suspected STEMI were collected. ECGs were interpreted in real time by the GEMarquette 12SL ECG analysis program. Predictive values were estimated with a bayesian latent class model incorporating the computerized ECG interpretations, consensus ECG interpretations by study cardiologists, and hospital diagnosis. On-scene time was compared for ambulance-transported patients with (n 5 985) and without (n 5 5,056) prehospital ECGs who received prehospital aspirin and/or nitroglycerin. Results: The computer's positive and negative predictive values for STEMI were 74.0% (95% credible interval [CrI] 69.6-75.6) and 98.1% (95% CrI 97.8-98.4), respectively. The sensitivity and specificity were 69.2% (95% CrI 59.0-78.5) and 98.9% (95% CrI 98.1-99.4), respectively. Prehospital ECGs were associated with a mean increase in on-scene time of 5.9 minutes (95% confidence interval 5.5-6.3). Conclusions: The predictive values of the computerized prehospital ECG interpretation appear to be adequate for diversion programs that direct patients with a positive result to hospitals with angioplasty facilities. The estimated 26.0% chance that a positive interpretation is false is likely too high for activation of a catheterization laboratory from the field. Acquiring prehospital ECGs does not substantially increase on-scene time in the BLS setting. © Canadian Association of Emergency Physicians.

N2  - © Research India Publications. The proposed system aims at non-invasively measure vital parameters of the ICU patient and make available the real-time data to the physician using the above mentioned protocols. The system is designed in such a way that if due to non-availability of resources if one of the data transfer protocols fails the parameters (ECG, Heart rate, blood Pressure and body temperature) are sent through the next protocol and hence the data reaches the physician and the patient is serviced accordingly The sole purpose of the system is to ease the monitoring system and to ensure proper treatment of the patient in the right time. Another area where the system focuses is that in rural areas very few resources are available which includes non-availability of internet, so real-time data is transferred using power lines from one room to other. Also using GSM technology data can be sent to phone using text message if doctor is not present in the hospital premises.

N2  - In this paper, we present a novel algorithm to evaluate the quality of ECG recordings. Our algorithm is designed to help clinicians in rapid selection of good quality ECG segments from long recordings collected by an ECG monitoring device such as a 12-lead bedside monitor. With some adjustments, we used the Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2011 database in order to compare the performance of our algorithm to the published results. The challenge was aimed to develop near real-time algorithms in mobile phones and provide feedback on quality of the ECGs for interpretation to the users who are mostly laypersons with little knowledge of ECG interpretation. Our algorithm generates a noise score which is a combination of two parameters: a high-frequency noise measure which accounts for the muscle noise and other fast changing artifacts, and a baseline wander noise measure quantifying the low-frequency noise. The training dataset (set A) with reference quality assessments was used to determine an optimum threshold on the ROC curve for classification of acceptable and unacceptable segments. The algorithm was then evaluated on the test dataset (set B) with undisclosed annotations. Our method achieved maximum accuracy of 93.9% on the training dataset and an accuracy of 90.2% on the test dataset, placing itself among the top 10 performers who participated in the challenge.

N2  - Several ECG features are common electrocardiographic markers for manual interpretation of early repolarization (ER) and acute pericarditis (PCARD), both confounders for acute myocardial infarction (AMI). We hypothesized these features could improve automated AM! detection in the presence of ER and PCARD. Method: The training set of ECGs included cardiologist reading of ER (n= 147), PCARD (n= 114), normal (n=239) and AMI (n=380). AMI was confirmed by reading infarct evolution in serial ECGs. The test set came from emergency department chest pain patients (n= 1806). The reference was discharge diagnosis of AMI. Positive ECGs (n=1023) were both STEM! and NSTEMI. ECGs not meeting STEM! criteria by algorithm were excluded from both the test and training sets leaving 430 and 581 ECGs respectively. Two logistic regression AMI classifiers were compared, one using traditional features, another using traditional plus additional features to help detect ER and PCARD. Additional features included J-waves, notches, slurs, PQ segment depression, ST-T concavity, spatial QRS-T angle, and T-wave PCA ratio. Results: As expected, the traditional ST-T features had the most discrimination power. However, the automatically-selected best features included T-wave PCA ratio and the mean anterior PQ segment depression. Total accuracy was higher for the additional feature classifier, 79% versus 70%. Conclusion: Additional ECG features aimed at ER and PCARD may improve automatic AM! classification when STEMI criteria are met.

N2  - It is estimated that 3.2 million people have developed atrial fibrillation (AF) in the United States and 30% of AF patients are unaware of their diagnosis (silent AF). We tested a new technology for contactless detection of AF based on facial video recordings in patients undergoing electrical cardioversion for AF. The proposed technique uses the facial video signal to extract the beat-to-beat variations of the skin color reflecting the cardiac pulsatile signal. We developed the concept of Pulse Harmonic Strength (PHS) to capture AF patterns from this signal. Also, we quantified the variability of the heart rate and pulse rate using additional measurements of heart rate variability. Eleven subjects (65±6 years, 8 males) were enrolled in the study and 407 epochs of 15 sec. were acquired simultaneously with ECG and facial video signals. PHS was associated with a 20% detection error rate of AF in reference to human interpretation while the error rates of the automatic ECG-based measurements ranged between 17% and 29% across the investigated HRV parameters.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the clinical effectiveness of continuous blood purification (CBP) in combination with ulinastatin for the treatment of thermoplegia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty patients (28 men and 12 women) with severe heat stroke were admitted to our hospitals ICU department from June 2010 to August 2013. The patients were randomized into a treatment group (n=21; 15 men and six women, with an average age of 32.9 years) and control group (n=19; 13 men and six women, with an average age of 33.1 years). Patients in the control group underwent treatments of oxygen inhalation, dynamic ECG monitoring, physical cooling methods (ice caps or ice application), whereas patients in the treatment group, in addition to this treatment, were further treated with continuous blood purification in combination with ulinastatin. During administration, the content of one vial was dissolved in 100 mL of physiological saline for intravenous dripping for 1.5 hours. RESULTS: There were 18 cured cases, one case of sequelae of mild neurological disorders, and two deaths in the treatment group, with the cure rate of 90.48%. In comparison, there were 12 cured cases, three cases of sequelae of mild neurological disorders, and four deaths in the control group, with the cure rate of 78.95%. The overall response rates of rectal temperature drop were determined to be 95.24% and 73.68% for the treatment group and the control group, respectively. Based on the treatment outcomes data, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) recovery, deaths and survival outcomes of patients in the treatment group was more favorable than that of the control group. This difference was statistically significant (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Continuous blood purification in combination with ulinastatin is effective in treating thermoplegia and warrants further investigation.

N2  - © 2013. Background: One-third of stroke and Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) are cryptogenic requiring additional investigation and intervention. Occult Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation (PAF) has been suggested as a possible cause for these cryptogenic strokes. Objective: The aim of our study is to evaluate the role of simple ECG & bedside echocardiographic parameters for prediction of PAF in patients presenting with stroke or TIAs. Patients & methods: The study included 60 patients with non hemorrhagic stroke. During 1week of continuous ICU monitoring, 30% of patients had PAF (group 1), the remaining 42 patients did not develop PAF (group 2). All patients were subjected to detailed history taking, thorough clinical examination including NIHSS, serial ECGs for calculation of maximum and minimum P wave duration (Pmax, and Pmin) & P wave dispersion (Pdis), and transthoracic echocardiography for calculation of left atrial volume (LAV), and left atrial volume index (LAVI). Results: It was found that Pmax & Pdis were significantly higher in group 1 in comparison to group 2 (147.7±9.6mm vs 114.3±9mm, P: <0.001) and (54.1±7.5mm vs 30.2±7mm, P: <0.001), respectively. Also LAV & LAVI were significantly higher in group 1 compared to group 2 (57.1±10mm vs 40.1±12mm, P: <0.001) & (28.9±3mm2/m2 vs 20.1±8mm2/m2, P: <0.001), respectively. On multivariate logistic regression analysis Pmax, Pdis, and LAVI were the most significant independent predictors of PAF. Conclusion: PAF is a possible etiology of patients with ischemic cerebrovascular accidents patients even in those who had normal sinus rhythm on admission. Pmax≥125mm, Pdis≥40mm, and LAVI≥24 are highly significant predictors of PAF with PPV of 99%, 96% and 78%, respectively, sensitivity of 98%, 94% and 89%, respectively, specificity 96%, 93% and 75%, respectively and AUC of 0.99, 0.98 and 0.87, respectively.

N2  - Background: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common arrhymia, and it results in increased risk of thromboembolism and decreased cardiac function. In patients undergoing cardiac surgery, concomitant radiofrequency ablation to treat AF is effective in restoring sinus rhythm (SR). This study is an observational cohort study aimed to investigate the safety and efficacy of bipolar radiofrequency ablation (BRFA) for treating AF combined with heart valve diseases. Methods. Clinical data were analyzed retrospectively from 324 cases of rheumatic heart disease combined with persistent AF patients who underwent valve replacement concomitant BRFA. The modified left atrial and the simplified right atrial ablation were used for AF treatments. Of the 324 patients, 248 patients underwent mitral valve replacement and 76 patients underwent double valve replacement. Meanwhile, 54 patients underwent concomitant thrombectomy and 97 underwent tricuspid valvuloplasty. And all of them received temporary pacemaker implantation. The 24 hours holter electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring and echocardiography was performed before the operation, on the first day after operation, on discharge day, and at 6 and 12 months after operation. Results: There were 299 patients with SR on the first day after operation (92.30%), 12 patients with junctional rhythm (3.70%), 11 patients with AF (3.39%), and 2 patients with atrial flutter (0.62%). The temporary pacemaker was used in 213 patients (65.74%) with heart rates less than 70 beat/minute in the ICU. Two patients died early and the mortality rate was 0.62%. Two patients had left ventricular rupture and the occurrence rate was 0.62%. They both recovered. There was no degree III atrioventricular blockage and no permanent pacemaker implantation. Overall survival rate was 99.38% (322 cases) with SR conversion rate of 89.13% (287 cases) at discharge. The SR conversion rate was 87.54% and 87.01% at 6 and 12 months after operation. Sinus bradycardia occurred in 3.42% of patients at 6 months after operation and in 3.03% of patients at 12 months after operation. Echocardiography showed that the left atrial diameter was significantly decreased, and ejection fraction and fractional shortening were significantly improved. Conclusions: BRFA for treating AF in concomitant valve replacement is safe and with good efficacy. © 2014 Chen et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

N2  - © 2014 IEEE. Telehealthcare is a global trend affecting clinical practice in the world. With the progress and development of telecommunication technologies, telecom facilities have afforded telehealthcare a new approach for chronic disease management. The electrocardiogram (ECG) is commonly used to detect abnormal heart rhythms and to investigate the cause of heart abnormalities. To reduce the cardiologists' loading and to provide a continuously telehealthcare, we developed a clinical decision and support system (CDSS) with automatic recognition of the ECG in real-time analysis. In addition, we adopted the approach of noise reduction and feature extraction for support vector machine (SVM) implementation with automatic learning algorithms. The automatic interpretation of ECG could provide assistance to physicians in decision-making, especially with large volumes of data. According to the preliminary results of automatic classification models, we acquired 88.4% sensitivity, for noise detection model, 85.9% specificity for sinus classification model and 89.1% sensitivity for disease classification model, respectively. However, it is not reliable enough to obviate the need for physician's diagnosis and confirmation. We should put much effort on enhancing the performance of ECG interpretation in the future.

N2  - © 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland. Smart Wireless Body Sensor Nodes (WBSNs) are a novel class of unobtrusive, battery-powered devices allowing the continuous monitoring and real-time interpretation ofa subject’s bio-signals, such as the electrocardiogram (ECG). These low-power platforms,while able to perform advanced signal processing to extract information on heart conditions,are usually constrained in terms of computational power and transmission bandwidth. It istherefore essential to identify in the early stages which parts of an ECG are critical for thediagnosis and, only in these cases, activate on demand more detailed and computationallyintensive analysis algorithms. In this work, we present a comprehensive framework forreal-time automatic classification of normal and abnormal heartbeats, targeting embeddedand resource-constrained WBSNs. In particular, we provide a comparative analysis ofdifferent strategies to reduce the heartbeat representation dimensionality, and thereforethe required computational effort. We then combine these techniques with a neuro-fuzzy classification strategy, which effectively discerns normal and pathological heartbeats witha minimal run time and memory overhead. We prove that, by performing a detailedanalysis only on the heartbeats that our classifier identifies as abnormal, a WBSN systemcan drastically reduce its overall energy consumption. Finally, we assess the choice ofneuro-fuzzy classification by comparing its performance and workload with respect to otherstate-of-the-art strategies. Experimental results using the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia databaseshow energy savings of as much as 60% in the signal processing stage, and 63% in thesubsequent wireless transmission, when a neuro-fuzzy classification structure is employed, coupled with a dimensionality reduction technique based on random projections.

N2  - The Electrocardiogram (ECG) is a diagnostic tool that measures and records the electrical activity of the heart. Interpretation of the ECG signal allows diagnosis of a wide range of heart conditions. These conditions can vary from minor to life threatening. In this paper real ECG records provided by the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database are used to build an efficient mechanism for detecting abnormalities in the ECG records. Prior to the detection, selected filters are used to eliminate any interference while maintaining the useful information within the signal. Detection of Heartbeat-related abnormalities of other heart diseases such as AV blockage and Ventricular Fibrillation is implemented. Results of ECG signal preprocessing and abnormality detection demonstrate the suitability of the selected filtering techniques and the efficiency of the detection mechanisms.

N2  - © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. The computer-aided interpretation of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals provides a non-invasive and inexpensive technique for analyzing heart activity under various cardiac conditions. Further, the proliferation of smartphones and wireless networks makes it possible to perform continuous Holter monitoring. However, although considerable attention has been paid to automated detection and classification of heartbeats from ECG data, classifier learning strategies have never been used to deal with individual variations in cardiac activity. In this paper, we propose a novel method for automatic classification of an individual's ECG beats for Holter monitoring. We use the Pan-Tompkins algorithm to accurately extract features such as the QRS complex and P wave, and employ a decision tree to classify each beat in terms of these features. Evaluations conducted against the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database before and after personalization of the decision tree using a patient's own ECG data yield heartbeat classification accuracies of 94.6% and 99%, respectively. These are comparable to results obtained from state. -of. -the-art schemes, validating the efficacy of our proposed method.

This study aimed to evaluate the predictive value of a novel non-linear method for analysis of HRV, multiscale entropy (MSE) and outcome of patients with acute stroke who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Methods: The MSE of HRV was analysed from 1 h continuous ECG signals in ICU-admitted patients with acute stroke and controls. The complexity index was defined as the area under the MSE curve (scale 1-20). A favourable outcome was defined as modified Rankin scale 0-2 at 3 months after stroke. Results: The trends of MSE curves in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) (n=77) were apparently different from those in patients with non-AF stroke (n=150) and controls (n=60). In addition, the values of complexity index were signi ficantly lower in the patients with non-AF stroke than in the controls (25.8±.3 vs 32.3±4.3, p<0.001). After adjustment for clinical variables, patients without AF who had a favourable outcome were significantly related to higher complexity index values (OR=1.15, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.25, p<0.001). Importantly, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for predicting a favourable outcome of patients with non-AF stroke from clinical parameters was 0.858 (95% CI 0.797 to 0.919) and signi ficantly improved to 0.903 (95% CI 0.853 to 0.954) after adding on the parameter of complexity index values ( p=0.020). Conclusions: In ICU-admitted patients with acute stroke, early assessment of the complexity of HRV by MSE can help in predicting outcomes in patients without AF.

N2  - © 2015 American Heart Association, Inc. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE - : Guidelines recommend continuous ECG monitoring in patients with cerebrovascular events. Studies on intensive care units (ICU) demonstrated high sensitivity but high rates of false alarms of monitoring systems resulting in desensitization of medical personnel potentially endangering patient safety. Data on patients with acute stroke are lacking. METHODS - : One-hundred fifty-one consecutive patients with acute cerebrovascular events were prospectively included. Automatically identified arrhythmia events were analyzed by manual ECG analysis. Muting of alarms was registered. Sensitivity was evaluated by beat-to-beat analysis of the entire recorded ECG data in a subset of patients. Ethics approval was obtained by University of Erlangen-Nuremberg. RESULTS - : A total of 4809.5 hours of ECG registration and 22 509 alarms were analyzed. The automated detection algorithm missed no events but the overall rate of false alarms was 27.4%. Only 0.6% of all alarms indicated acute life-threatening events and 91.4% of these alarms were incorrect. Transient muting of acoustic alarms was observed in 20.5% patients. CONCLUSIONS - : Continuous ECG monitoring using automated arrhythmia detection is highly sensitive in acute stroke. However, high rates of false alarms and alarms without direct therapeutic consequence cause desensitization of personnel. Therefore, acoustic alarms may be limited to life-threatening events but standardized manual evaluation of all alarms should complement automated systems to identify clinically relevant arrhythmias.

N2  - © 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. It is well known that there are gender differences in 12 lead ECG measurements, some of which can be statistically significant. It is also an accepted practice that we should consider those differences when we interpret ECGs, by either a human overreader or a computerized algorithm. There are some major gender differences in 12 lead ECG measurements based on automatic algorithms, including global measurements such as heart rate, QRS duration, QT interval, and lead-by-lead measurements like QRS amplitude, ST level, etc. The interpretation criteria used in the automatic algorithms can be adapted to the gender differences in the measurements. The analysis of a group of 1339 patients with acute inferior MI showed that for patients under age 60, women had lower ST elevations at the J point in lead II than men (57 ± 91 μV vs. 86 ± 117 μV, p < 0.02). This trend was reversed for patients over age 60 (lead aVF: 102 ± 126 μV vs. 84 ± 117 μV, p < 0.04; lead III: 130 ± 146 μV vs. 103 ± 131 μV, p < 0.007). Therefore, the ST elevation thresholds were set based on available gender and age information, which resulted in 25% relative sensitivity improvement for women under age 60, while maintaining a high specificity of 98%. Similar analyses were done for prolonged QT interval and LVH cases. The paper uses several design examples to demonstrate (1) how to design a gender-specific algorithm, and (2) how to design a robust ECG interpretation algorithm which relies less on absolute threshold-based criteria and is instead more reliant on overall morphology features, which are especially important when gender information is unavailable for automatic analysis.

N2  - © Cambridge University Press 2015 Background: Traditional approaches to physiological signal processing have focused on highly sensitive, and less specific detection techniques, generally with the expectation that an expert will overread the results and deal with the false positives. However, acquisition of physiological signals has become increasingly routine in recent years, and clinicians are often fed large flows of data which can become rapidly unmanageable and lead to missed important events and alarm fatigue (Aboukhalil et al. 2008). Ignoring the nascent world of the quantified self for now, which itself has the potential to swamp medical practitioners with all manner of noise, there are two obvious examples of this paradigm. First, each intensive care unit (ICU) generates an enormous quantity of physiological data, up to 1GB per person per day (Clifford et al. 2009) More than 5 million patients are admitted annually to ICUs in the United States, with Europe and the rest of the world, rapidly catching up (Mullins et al. 2013; Rhodes et al. 2012). This can be attributed in part to the aging global population. ICU patients are a heterogeneous population, but all require a high level of acute care, with numerous bedside monitors. Patients in the ICU often require mechanical ventilation or cardiovascular support and invasive monitoring modalities and treatments (e.g., hemodialysis, plasmapheresis and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation). With an ever increasing reliance on technology to keep critically ill patients alive, the number of ICU beds in the US has grown significantly, to an estimated 6000 or more (Rhodes et al. 2012). Assuming an average ICU bed occupancy of 68.2% (Wunsch et al. 2013), the sum total of all bedside data generated in the US is over a petabyte of data each year. Multi-terabyte ICU databases are therefore becoming available (Saeed et al. 2011), and include parameters such as the ECG, the photoplethysmogram, arterial blood pressure and respiratory effort.

N2  - © 2015 CCAL. High sampling frequency is not usually available in hospital monitoring systems, what can limit the usefulness of the data, namely for repolarization measures. In this work the reliability of beat-to-beat measures using low sampling frequency is quantified with respect to the original high sampling rate. ECG recordings originally at 1000 Hz, including intensive care patients data, were downsampled to 500 Hz and to 250 Hz. Automatic delineation was applied to extract beat-to-beat intervals. The reliability was measured considering concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC); the Information-based measure of disagreement (IBMD) was used for agreement quantification. High reliability and low disagreement were generally found. Using the conventional interpretation excellent consistency was found at 250 HZ for more than 68%, 50%, 50% and 58% of the cases for RR, RT, QT and QTc, respectively. Results indicate that at 250 Hz RR, RT, QT and QTc measures are still reliable compared with the values at 1000 Hz.

N2  - © 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. Over the past few years, reducing the number of false positive cardiac monitor alarms (FA) in the intensive care unit (ICU) has become an issue of the utmost importance. In our work, we developed a robust methodology that, without the need for additional non-ECG waveforms, suppresses false positive ventricular tachycardia (VT) alarms without resulting in false negative alarms. Our approach is based on features extracted from the ECG signal 20 seconds prior to a triggered alarm. We applied a multi resolution wavelet transform to the ECG data 20 seconds prior to the alarm trigger, extracted features from appropriately chosen scales and combined them across all available leads. These representations are presented to a L1-regularized logistic regression classifier. Results are shown in two datasets of physiological waveforms with manually assessed cardiac monitor alarms: the MIMIC II dataset, where we achieved a false alarm (FA) suppression of 21% with zero true alarm (TA) suppression; and a dataset compiled by UCSF and General Electric, where a 36% FA suppression was achieved with a zero TA suppression. The methodology described in this work could be implemented to reduce the number of false monitor alarms in other arrhythmias.

ECG is recorded by placing electrodes at specified positions of human body. During recording, ECG is contaminated with artifacts and noises which always degrade its quality, and makes accurate and automatic interpretation more difficult. Power line interference, baseline wanders and muscle tremors are mostly noticed artifacts or noises. So for accurate delineation of characteristics points of ECG, a good quality of ECG is necessary. This paper is presenting a survey on various methods developed for de-noising, delineation of characteristics points and classification of diseases along with their respective advantages and disadvantages.

N2  - © 2014 IEEE. Traditional approaches for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) diagnosis are apt to using multiple channels of physiological signals to detect apnea events by dividing the signals into equal-length segments, which may lead to incorrect apnea event detection and weaken the performance of OSA diagnosis. This paper proposes an automatic-segmentation-based screening approach with the single channel of Electrocardiogram (ECG) signal for OSA subject diagnosis, and the main work of the proposed approach lies in three aspects: (i) an automatic signal segmentation algorithm is adopted for signal segmentation instead of the equal-length segmentation rule; (ii) a local median filter is improved for reduction of the unexpected RR intervals before signal segmentation; (iii) the designed OSA severity index and additional admission information of OSA suspects are plugged into support vector machine (SVM) for OSA subject diagnosis. A real clinical example from PhysioNet database is provided to validate the proposed approach and an average accuracy of 97.41% for subject diagnosis is obtained which demonstrates the effectiveness for OSA diagnosis. Note to Practitioners - Automatic diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea based on physiological signals is critical for healthcare service improvement. Equal-length segmentation of signals is adopted in current OSA diagnosis, in which each segment of signal requires inferences from physicians to determine the apnea events. However, this equal-length segmentation may bring possible misdetected apnea events, and finally lead to an incorrect diagnosis. This paper aims to reduce the number of misdetected apnea events by proposing an automatic segmentation rule with consideration of reasonable physiological interpretation. An OSA severity index which can be obtained from signal segments of each subject is designed. An SVM is employed to implement the final diagnosis. To fully implement this approach, it is necessary (i) to preprocess the RR intervals and eliminate unexpected signal points; (ii) to embed individual information of OSA suspects into an SVM. A real world case study has shown that the proposed diagnosis approach provided a satisfactory diagnosis accuracy.

N2  - © 2015 CCAL. It is crucial to assure the quality of ECG recordings to support correct clinical interpretation. This research aimed at developing an automated standardization method to gauge digital electrocardiography (EC) devices. The proposed microprocessed gauge equipment (MGE) is divided into digital and analogic circuits, and embedded software to control them. Conditioned reference signals (CRS) from Physionet Bank were embedded in the MGE to simulate cardiac activity. The outputs from the MGE (or EC) are then compared with the CRS. All circuits of the MGE are gauged at the self-check mode. CRS are sent to the EC when set at the EC check mode. A commercial EC equipment was used in the MGE validation (IEC60601-2-51:2005), assessed with the statistical R2 correlation analysis and Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS). At the MGE self-test, temperature and humidity were changed (R2≥0.99 as designed). The KS test (P<0.01) resulted in D=0.012 for amplitude accuracy, 0.0028 for timing accuracy and 0.021 for signal stability against noise influence. All KS values were lower than their respective critical values according to the default standard (5%). Finally, visual inspection between EC signals and CRS on printed graph paper at a standard scale certifies the EC reliability.

However, the amount of false alarms of cardiac episodes still outnumbers the true ones significantly. The advanced analysis of multiple signals registered by monitoring system might enable reduction of the false alarms. We analyzed 750 multi-channel recordings from the PhysioNet Challenge 2015 labeled either 'true alarm' or 'false alarm'. In our algorithm there are multiple methods enabling to determine the location of R peaks in ECG signal, basing mostly on RS slopes. Similar slope detection method is performed for other channels provided. In case of signals where it is not possible to detect QRS complexes direct signal morphology assessment is used. These steps allowed us to obtain information needed to verifY if the alarm was true or false. The final scores of PhysioNet Challenge 2015 were: 57. 72for Real-time event and 63.69 for the Retrospective one.

N2  - The necessity of respiratory monitoring is rapidly increasing in medical field to diagnose various cardio-pulmonary diseases. It is difficult to monitor respiration for ambulatory and ICU patients, as conventional methods are either obtrusive or suffer from low accuracy. The extraction of ECG derived respiration (EDR) signal using single-lead ECG has been proposed lately. This allows monitoring of ECG and respiration signal simultaneously from a recorded ECG signal. Recently few methods for EDR extraction from ECG are reported in literature. In this work, respiratory rates (RR) are derived from Heart Rate Variability (HRV) and Peak Amplitude Variation (PAV) method and a comparative study of these two methods is reported. Moreover, the validation of the proposed methods is made by comparing the obtained RR with that derived from original respiration signal. Subjects from Fantasia database and real-time data for both normal and with pulmonary diseases are considered for the work.Grant: Authors are thankful to Dr. Pranab Kumar Mandal (Head of the Department, Chest Medicine, NRS Medical College, Kolkata-700014), and Dr. Avradip Santra (Clinical Tutor, Chest Medicine, NRS Medical College Hospital, Kolkata- 700014) for real-time data acquisition and classification of the data with pulmonary diseases.

Objectives To evaluate the feasibility of non-electrocardiogram (ECG)-triggered 70-kVp high-pitch aortic computed tomography angiography (CTA) with iterative reconstruction (IR) and reduced contrast agent using second-generation dual-source CT (DSCT). Methods Seventy-seven patients were examined: group A (n = 21), 70-kVp high-pitch (3.2) CTA, 60 mL contrast agent and IR on second-generation DSCT; group B (n = 29), standard-pitch (1.2) CTA, automatic tube voltage selection, filtered back projection and 80 mL contrast agent on second-generation DSCT; group C (n = 27), 120-kVp standard-pitch (1.2) CTA, filtered back projection, and 80 mL contrast agent on first-generation DSCT. Computed tomography values, noise, signal-to-noise ratio, contrast-to-noise ratio, and subjective image quality were compared. Results Computed tomography values and noise of all aortic segments in group A were increased compared with groups B and C (P < 0.05). Group B showed the highest signal-to-noise ratio and contrast-to-noise ratio for all aortic segments (P < 0.05), whereas no significant differences were found between groups A and C (P > 0.05). Mean effective dose was 0.88 ± 0.08 mSv for group A, reduced by 93% compared to group C and by 90% compared to group B. Conclusions Non-ECG-triggered 70-kVp high-pitch aortic CTA with IR provides equivalent diagnostic image quality with 90% reduction of radiation dose and 25% reduction of contrast volume compared with standard 120-kVp CTA.

N2  - © 2015 The Authors. Sudden death is the most common disease of heart diseases and usually caused by cardiac arrest. The electrocardiograph (ECG) system is the most direct way to observe and monitor health status of the heart. In this kind of disease, the patient may need continuous monitoring, and sometimes is kept in Intensive Care Unit (ICU), which needs more utilities and manpower that will eventually leads to increase the cost and demands for qualified medical staff. In this paper we introduce a comprehensive real time monitoring ECG system for continuous monitoring patients inside/outside home. Wearable Wireless Sensor Network with a cluster head is connected to patient body for monitoring. Measured data by WWSS are transmitted via cluster head to an internet connection to the monitoring system located on the hospital. In case of emergency, the measured data is sent to the physician's cell phone for any necessary actions. We discuss the inside/outside system structure. Additionally, we analyze the proposed system in terms of power consumptions and optimum distance between WSN sensors.

Continuous patient monitoring systems acquire enormous amounts of data that is either manually analysed by doctors or automatically processed using intelligent algorithms. Sections of data acquired over long period of time can be corrupted with artefacts due to patient movement, sensor placement and interference from other sources. Owing to the large volume of data these artefacts need to be automatically identified so that the analysis systems and doctors are aware of them while making medical diagnosis. Three important factors are explored that must be considered and quantified for the design and evaluation of automatic artefact identification algorithms: signal quality, interpretation quality and computational complexity. The first two are useful to determine the effectiveness of an algorithm, whereas the third is particularly vital in mHealth systems where computational resources are heavily constrained. A series of artefact identification and filtering algorithms are then presented focusing on the electrocardiography data. These algorithms are quantified using the three metrics to demonstrate how different algorithms can be evaluated and compared to select the best ones for a given wireless sensor network.

N2  - © 2015 Jin et al. Background: Measurement of myocardial T2 is becoming widely used in the assessment of patients at risk for cardiac iron overload. The conventional breath-hold, ECG-triggered, segmented, multi-echo gradient echo (MGRE) sequence used for myocardial T2quantification is very sensitive to respiratory motion and may not be feasible in patients who are unable to breath-hold. We propose a free-breathing myocardial T2 mapping approach that combines a single-shot gradient-echo echo-planar imaging (GRE-EPI) sequence for T2-weighted image acquisition with automatic non-rigid motion correction (MOCO) of respiratory motion between single-shot images. Methods: ECG-triggered T2-weighted images at different echo times were acquired by a black-blood, single-shot GRE-EPI sequence during free-breathing. A single image at a single TE is acquired in each heartbeat. Automatic non-rigid MOCO was applied to correct for in-plane respiratory motion before pixel-wise T2mapping. In a total of 117 patients referred for clinical cardiac magnetic resonance exams, the free-breathing MOCO GRE-EPI sequence was compared to the breath-hold segmented MGRE approach. Image quality was scored independently by 2 experienced observers blinded to the particular image acquisition strategy. T2measurements in the interventricular septum and in the liver were compared for the two methods in all cases with adequate image quality. Results: T2maps were acquired in all 117 patients using the breath-hold MGRE and the free-breathing MOCO GRE-EPI approaches, including 8 patients with myocardial iron overload and 25 patients with hepatic iron overload. The mean image quality of the free-breathing MOCO GRE-EPI images was scored significantly higher than that of the breath-hold MGRE images by both reviewers. Out of the 117 studies, 21 breath-hold MGRE studies (17.9 % of all the patients) were scored to be less than adequate or very poor by both reviewers, while only 2 free-breathing MOCO GRE-EPI studies were scored to be less than adequate image quality. In a comparative evaluation of the images with at least adequate quality, the intra-class correlation coefficients for myocardial and liver T2were 0.868 and 0.986 respectively (p < 0.001), indicating that the T2measured by breath-hold MGRE and free-breathing MOCO GRE-EPI were in close agreement. The coefficient of variation between the breath-hold and free-breathing approaches for myocardial and liver T2were 9.88 % and 9.38 % respectively. Bland-Altman plots demonstrated good absolute agreement of T2in the interventricular septum and the liver from the free-breathing and breath-hold approaches (mean differences -0.03 and 0.16 ms, respectively). Conclusion: The free-breathing approach described for T2mapping using MOCO GRE-EPI enables accurate myocardial and liver T2measurements and is insensitive to respiratory motion.

Also, in present it is common to apply as many automated technology solutions as possible. Generally, this should insure better quality of gained diagnostic results. On the other hand, complex solutions invoke human error in procedure, which ultimately can provide inaccurate results. The influence of such errors on example of ECG testing is analyzed and compared to normal ECG test in this research, where six scenarios are deliberately forced to provide fault diagnose.

N2  - © 2016 IEEE. Radiology and pathology almost by definition are "big data" in both the healthcare and research arenas. The data sources are not only big, but incredibly varied. At the core of both medical practices are the acquired images that must be processed, transmitted, stored/archived and interpreted. Radiology is the most common medical imaging specialty with recent estimates of 3.6 billion medical procedures being done worldwide annually with ionizing radiation (3.1 billion diagnostic radiologic, 0.5 billion dental, and 37 million nuclear medicine examinations) [1]. The workload in pathology in terms of number of images that need to be processed and interpreted are incredibly large as well [2]. One of the key differences between radiology and pathology is that radiology has been digital for over 25 years and used routinely in clinical practice since the early 1990s; while pathology, although having had digital capability as whole slide imaging (WSI) since the late 1990s has yet to take off clinically due in most part to lack of FDA approval for the WSI acquisition and viewing systems for clinical use. With the advent of telemedicine the number of types of "big data" have increased exponentially with everything from store-forward dermatology and ophthalmology images, to realtime video data, to monitoring data of all sorts from wearable and other types of physiological monitoring sensors operated in every mode from periodic to 24/7. On the clinical side there are a number of tools that have been developed over the years to deal with all this data, most recently in the form of "dashboards" to help visualize aspects of clinical productivity such as device (e.g., MRI, CT, ultrasound) utilization to optimize patient scheduling and identify bottlenecks, clinician tracking to monitor RVUs (relative value units), QA/QC monitoring and a host of other metrics required to run a large or even small healthcare enterprise. Most of these tools include access not only to the raw data, but also to graphic and other visual representations to help users interpret the data efficiently and effectively. Surprisingly there have been very few studies on this aspect, although companies are starting to realize that there is usually no one-size-fits-all GUI and that product offerings likely need to be tailored somewhat at the individual site level. In terms of remote monitoring data there are a number of aspects relevant to the big data question, most typically centered on what data are useful and what data are not, and how to interpret the data (either by human or computer) in a meaningful way. For example, remote ECG monitoring systems are increasingly being used to monitor patients with a variety of cardiac conditions but there are significant challenges [3]. One of the key problems is trying to automate the analysis of the incoming data to reliability identify abnormal events (and intervene) without false positive rates that render the system useless due to the "annoyance" factor. Numerous groups are working on developing tools to classify the signals, but the problem is confounded by the fact that clinical guidelines are typically based on (often outdated and often applicable to only a narrow group of patients) population based data that at the individual level may be meaningless (e.g., baseline "normal" function for one patient may be quite different from baseline for someone else, so the algorithm needs to take this into account in order to maximize the true positive and minimize the false positive rates). The American Telemedicine Association (ATA) is developing a guideline document to address another important big data question in remote monitoring - the relationship between health care professionals and patient data, the responsibilities of the health care professional or clinical team to assess, interpret, and respond, to the data, and the responsibilities of the patient with respect to the data. For example, the nature and intent of use of the data are important to consider. If the data have a measurable impact on quality improvements in care delivery, it should receive a higher level of importance. If the data represent information about leading indicators for quality, then importance is high, but if they represent information for trailing indicators the data are less important. Data sources can also be weighted by importance. Healthcare provider requested data generated by the patient in a formal program based on improving health indicators, particularly for high risk patients, have high importance, while information generated by a patient and sent to a clinician that is not a part of a formal care process is of less importance. The technology itself can be taken into account as consumer-grade mobile technologies can be weighted less than an FDA cleared medical devices. From the research perspective there are numerous ways that big data are being used not only in terms of developing better ways to visualize and interpret image data (for example the use computer-aided detection and decision tools to analyze radiographic, pathologic and other clinical images), but also to analyze non-image medical data such as radiographic and pathologic reports. With respect to the latter, for example, there has been recent work in our department using sentiment analysis to assess whether the sentiment of a provider is associated with radiographic imaging utilization in the context of medical notes on ICU patients. Ten years of EMR data were analyzed using sentiment analysis software (a branch of natural language processing (NLP) that combines text analysis and computational linguistics to assess emotion in written text). Initial data suggest that there is a significant association with negative sentiment being associated with an increase in image utilization that decreased over time. In other words, physicians who judged their patients to be failing ordered more imaging exams than for those they perceived of as healthier or more stable, but then as time passed ordering was reduced overall. Another project is conducting a retrospective review of records from over 100,000 breast imaging studies to study rates of recall based on time intervals from last interpreted examination, permitting an analysis of the impact of human capital depreciation, fatigue, and more generally the day of week on the likelihood of a recall recommendation. This type of analysis could guide how we schedule our clinicians (easing them back into their routine so to speak) after vacations, multiple days on service and so on in order to avoid errors. Although much of the research focus in big data is focused on the computational side of the equation, there is some work being conducted on the human side - how does the clinician or other healthcare provider deal with all this information? On the one hand are studies that assess whether or not data from these sources (e.g., remote monitoring) has any impact on patient care [4]. On the other hand are the studies that approach data interpretation and use from a more human factors perspective. For example, we use eye tracking technology (Figure 1) to investigate and understand how clinicians interact with images and whether the information provided impacts both the decisions rendered as well as the efficiency with which they are rendered. (Figure Presented) In one recent study we examined the impact of adding a photo of the patient to the interface when radiologists interpreted a series of chest images. The goal was to address the fact that due to mislabeling of images "wrong patient" errors can and do occur. With 10 observers viewing a series of 21 portable chest x-ray images with and without photos, the presence of the photograph reduced the number of fixations (chest radiograph only mean 98.68; chest with photograph present 80.81; photograph 10.59) and total dwell (chest radiograph only mean 30.84 sec; chest radiograph with photograph present 25.68; photograph 3.93) on the chest radiograph as a result of periodically looking at the photograph. Overall time viewing the cases did not differ as time not spent on the radiograph was spent on the photograph. On average readers scanned from the radiograph to the photographs about 4 times during search. The added information of photographs may help with certain image interpretation tasks and may help personalize the reading experience for radiologists. There are numerous ways that big data is used in clinical practice. This presentation will highlight some of the novel approaches being used to analyze clinical data a variety of sources to address pressing questions in the clinic regarding ways to optimize data presentation for the clinical user as well as how to use big data to guide clinical practice and optimize patient care.

N2  - © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht. To compare the performance of semi-automatic versus manual segmentation for ECG-triggered cardiovascular computed tomography (CT) examinations prior to transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), with focus on the speed and precision of experienced versus inexperienced observers. The preoperative ECG-triggered CT data of 30 consecutive patients who were scheduled for TAVR were included. All datasets were separately evaluated by two radiologists with 1 and 5 years of experience (novice and expert, respectively) in cardiovascular CT using an evaluation software program with or without a semi-automatic TAVR workflow. The time expended for data loading and all segmentation steps required for the implantation planning were assessed. Inter-software as well as inter-observer reliability analysis was performed. The CT datasets were successfully evaluated, with mean duration between 520.4 ± 117.6 s and 693.2 ± 159.5 s. The three most time-consuming steps were the 3D volume rendering, the measurement of aorta diameter and the sizing of the aortic annulus. Using semi-automatic segmentation, a novice could evaluate CT data approximately 12.3 % faster than with manual segmentation, and an expert could evaluate CT data approximately 10.3 % faster [mean differences of 85.4 ± 83.8 s (p < 0.001) and 59.8 ± 101 s (p < 0.001), respectively]. The inter-software reliability for a novice was slightly lower than for an expert; however, the reliability for a novice and expert was excellent (ICC 0.92, 95 % CI 0.75–0.97/ICC 0.96, 95 % CI 0.91–0.98). Automatic aortic annulus detection failed in two patients (6.7 %). The study revealed excellent inter-software and inter-observer reliability, with a mean ICC of 0.95. TAVR evaluation can be accomplished significantly faster with semi-automatic rather than with manual segmentation, with comparable exactness, showing a benefit for experienced and inexperienced observers.

N2  - © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. Aim: Resuscitation guidelines recommend different treatments depending on the patient's cardiac rhythm. Rhythm interpretation is a key tool to retrospectively evaluate and improve the quality of treatment. Manual rhythm annotation is time consuming and an obstacle for handling large resuscitation datasets efficiently. The objective of this study was to develop a system for automatic rhythm interpretation by using signal processing and machine learning algorithms. Methods: Data from 302 out of hospital cardiac arrest patients were used. In total 1669 3-second artifact free ECG segments with clinical rhythm annotations were extracted. The proposed algorithms combine 32 features obtained from both wavelet- and time-domain representations of the ECG, followed by a feature selection procedure based on the wrapper method in a nested cross-validation architecture. Linear and quadratic discriminant analyses (LDA and QDA) were used to automatically classify the segments into one of five rhythm types: ventricular tachycardia (VT), ventricular fibrillation (VF), pulseless electrical activity (PEA), asystole (AS), and pulse generating rhythms (PR). Results: The overall accuracy for the best algorithm was 68%. VT, VF, and AS are recognized with sensitivities of 71%, 75%, and 79%, respectively. Sensitivities for PEA and PR were 55% and 56%, respectively, which reflects the difficulty of identifying pulse using only the ECG. Conclusions: An ECG based automatic rhythm interpreter for resuscitation has been demonstrated. The interpreter handles VT, VF and AS well, while PEA and PR discrimination poses a more difficult problem.

N2  - © 2016 IEEE. Following a surgical procedure, patients are monitored in an ICU until physically stable, after which are discharged to a ward for further evaluation and recovery. Usually, ward evaluation does not imply continuous physiological parameters monitoring and therefore patient relapse is not uncommon. The present paper describes the steps taken to design and build a low-cost modular monitoring system prototype. This system aims to offer mobile support in order to facilitate faster and better medical interventions in emergency cases and has been developed using low-power dedicated sensor arrays for EKG, SpO2, temperature and movement. The interfaces for these sensors have been developed according to the IoT model: a central control unit exposes a RESTful based Web interface that ensures a platform agnostic behaviour and provides a flexible mechanism to integrate new components.

Purpose: We investigated incidence, risk factors for new-onset atrial fibrillation (NAF), and prognostic impact during septic shock in medical Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients. Methods: Prospective, observational study in a university hospital. Consecutive patients from 03/ 2011 to 05/2013 with septic shock were eligible. Exclusion criteria were age <18 years, history of AF, transfer with prior septic shock. Included patients were equipped with long-duration (7 days) Holter ECG monitoring. NAF was defined as an AF episode lasting >30 seconds. Patient characteristics, infection criteria, cardiovascular parameters, severity of illness, support therapies were recorded. Results: Among 66 patients, 29(44%) developed NAF; 10 (34%) would not have been diagnosed without Holter ECG monitoring. NAF patients were older, with more markers of heart failure (troponin and NT-pro-BNP), lower left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), longer QRS duration and more nonsustained supra ventricular arrhythmias (<30s) on day 1 than patients who maintained sinus rhythm. By multivariate analysis, age (OR: 1.06; p = 0.01) and LVEF<45% (OR: 13.01, p = 0.03) were associated with NAF. NAF did not predict 28 or 90 day mortality. Conclusions: NAF is common, especially in older patients, and is associated with low ejection fraction. We did not find NAF to be independently associated with higher mortality.

N2  - © 2016 CCAL. In this paper, a new method of automatic detection of the Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome is proposed based on electrocardiograms (ECGs) signals. Firstly, with the continuous wavelet transform (CWT), the P wave, the T wave and the QRS complex are identified. Then, their durations are also computed after determination of the boundaries (onsets and offsets of the P, T waves and the QRS complex). Secondly, the PR interval, the QRS complex interval and the area of the QRS complex are determined in order to detect the presence or not of the delta wave. This method has been tested on ECGs signals from patients affected by the WPW syndrome in order to evaluate its robustness. It can provide assistance to cardiologists during the interpretation of the ECG.

N2  - © 2016 CCAL. The 12-lead Electrocardiogram (ECG) is ubiquitously used as a diagnostic support tool to detect cardiovascular disease. However, it is difficult to read and is often incorrectly interpreted. This study aims to further previous research, which used of a set of interactive questions and prompts to guide an interpreter through the ECG reporting process. The model was named 'Interactive Progressive based ECG Interpretation' (IPI). In this study, the IPI model has been augmented with an automatic diagnoses suggestion tool following annotated analysis of an ECG. To accomplish this, a rule-based algorithm has been created to assess the interpreters' ECG annotations to each of the interactive questions in the IPI model. This Differential Diagnoses Algorithm (DDA) was implemented using web technologies such as JavaScript and uses a modern device agnostic and language independent storage format (JSON) for defining the rules. Hence, by augmenting the IPI model with the DDA we hypothesize that this will further lower the number of interpretation errors and increase diagnostic accuracy in ECG interpretation.

The standard 12-lead ECG of 1248 patients and the automated measurements of the AC-and DC-coupled (unfiltered) versions were compared. We found a strong, linear correlation between the QRS integral and the difference in ST-segment amplitudes, suggesting that the AC coupling alters the ST segment. The effect on the remaining part of the ECG was minimal. Medical professionals and developers of software for ECG interpretation should be aware of such high-pass filter effects, since they could be misinterpreted as pathophysiology or some pathophysiology could be masked by these effects.

N2  - © 2016 CCAL. In heart rate monitoring, the Electrocardiogram (ECG) is commonly used and is considered to be the gold standard in the field. However, long term monitoring with ECG is rarely used except for ICU and 24-hours Holter. Prolonged cardiac monitoring in various setups can be achieved using a Ballistocardiogram (BCG), which serves as a convenient way for contact free monitoring of the heart activity. This study was aimed to assess the potential of measuring cardiac Inter Beat Interval (IBI) series in real-time using a BCG signal using a contact-free piezo-electric sensor placed under the mattress (EarlySense Ltd.). In this paper, we evaluated three real-time novel algorithm that provide IBI measurement, predicated IBI measurement accuracy and IBI statistic. The performance of these algorithms was evaluated using IBI series derived from one-lead ECG signal. The results support the claim that under the mattress piezoelectric sensor can be used to accurately measure IBI in real-time, and establish the basis for Heart Rate Variability (HRV) analysis.

Electrocardiogram, invasive blood pressure, central venous pressure, pulse oximetry, diuresis, body temperature and blood gas analysis were identified as routinely used hemodynamic monitoring, whereas advanced monitoring was performed with pulmonary artery catheter or echocardiography. Crystalloids were the fluids of choice for volume replacement (86.8 % of Centers). To guide volume management, central venous pressure (26.7 %) and invasive blood pressure (19.7 %) were the most frequently used parameters. Dobutamine was the first choice for treatment of left heart dysfunction (40 %) and epinephrine was the first choice for right heart dysfunction (26.8 %). Half of the Centers had an internal protocol for vasoactive drugs administration. Intra-aortic balloon pump and extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation were widely available among Cardiothoracic ICUs. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors were suspended in 28 % of the Centers. The survey shows what is considered as standard monitoring in Italian Cardiac ICUs. Standard, routinely used monitoring consists of ECG, SpO2, etCO2, invasive BP, CVP, diuresis, body temperature, and BGA. It also shows that there is large variability among the various Centers regarding hemodynamic monitoring of fluid therapy and inotropes administration. Further research is required to better standardize and define the indicators to improve the standards of intensive care after cardiac surgery among Italian cardiac ICUs.

N2  - © 2016 CCAL. Decision support tools assist clinicians every day in healthcare by supporting decision making at the point of care. For example, decision support tools can help clinicians reduce misdiagnoses during the interpretation of the Electrocardiogram (ECG), by providing a reference to ECG background, causes, features, waves and segment data. As a potential solution to these problems an ECG interpretation clinical decision support tool (CDSS) was constructed. The prototype consisted of a web based user interface connected to a SQL database of thirty-eight identified ECG diagnostic interpretations. Benefits and risks of using a clinician friendly web based query-builder interface to perform SQL queries on the database against traditional ECG interpretation methods were identified. Ethical reasons for using the web based decision support system software to assist ECG interpretation are discussed. Potential benefits in using the ECG interpretation CDSS across computer /tablet/smart-phone devices to assist the clinician's diagnosis decision making process are identified.

N2  - © 2016 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine. False alarm (FA) rates as high as 86% have been reported in intensive care unit monitors. High FA rates decrease quality of care by slowing staff response times while increasing patient burdens and stresses. In this study, we proposed a rule-based and multi-channel information fusion method for accurately classifying the true or false alarms for five life-threatening arrhythmias: asystole (ASY), extreme bradycardia (EBR), extreme tachycardia (ETC), ventricular tachycardia (VTA) and ventricular flutter/fibrillation (VFB). The proposed method consisted of five steps: (1) signal pre-processing, (2) feature detection and validation, (3) true/false alarm determination for each channel, (4) 'real-time' true/false alarm determination and (5) 'retrospective' true/false alarm determination (if needed). Up to four signal channels, that is, two electrocardiogram signals, one arterial blood pressure and/or one photoplethysmogram signal were included in the analysis. Two events were set for the method validation: event 1 for 'real-time' and event 2 for 'retrospective' alarm classification. The results showed that 100% true positive ratio (i.e. sensitivity) on the training set were obtained for ASY, EBR, ETC and VFB types, and 94% for VTA type, accompanied by the corresponding true negative ratio (i.e. specificity) results of 93%, 81%, 78%, 85% and 50% respectively, resulting in the score values of 96.50, 90.70, 88.89, 92.31 and 64.90, as well as with a final score of 80.57 for event 1 and 79.12 for event 2. For the test set, the proposed method obtained the score of 88.73 for ASY, 77.78 for EBR, 89.92 for ETC, 67.74 for VFB and 61.04 for VTA types, with the final score of 71.68 for event 1 and 75.91 for event 2.

N2  - © 2016 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine. False alarms in intensive care units represent a serious threat to patients. We propose a method for detection of five live-threatening arrhythmias. It is designed to work with multimodal data containing electrocardiograph and arterial blood pressure or photoplethysmograph signals. The presented method is based on descriptive statistics and Fourier and Hilbert transforms. It was trained using 750 records. The method was validated during the follow-up phase of the CinC/Physionet Challenge 2015 on a hidden dataset with 500 records, achieving a sensitivity of 93% (95%) and a specificity of 87% (88%) for real-time (retrospective) files. The given sensitivity and specificity resulted in score of 81.62 (84.96) for real-time (retrospective) records. The presented method is an improved version of the original algorithm awarded the first and the second prize in CinC/Physionet Challenge 2015.

N2  - © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. Background and Objectives: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia and a growing healthcare burden worldwide. It is often asymptomatic and may appear as episodes of very short duration; hence, the development of methods for its automatic detection is a challenging requirement to achieve early diagnosis and treatment strategies. The present work introduces a novel method exploiting the relative wavelet energy (RWE) to automatically detect AF episodes of a wide variety in length. Methods: The proposed method analyzes the atrial activity of the surface electrocardiogram (ECG), i.e., the TQ interval, thus being independent on the ventricular activity. To improve its performance under noisy recordings, signal averaging techniques were applied. The method's performance has been tested with synthesized recordings under different AF variable conditions, such as the heart rate, its variability, the atrial activity amplitude or the presence of noise. Next, the method was tested with real ECG recordings. Results: Results proved that the RWE provided a robust automatic detection of AF under wide ranges of heart rates, atrial activity amplitudes as well as noisy recordings. Moreover, the method's detection delay proved to be shorter than most of previous works. A trade-off between detection delay and noise robustness was reached by averaging 15 TQ intervals. Under these conditions, AF was detected in less than 7 beats, with an accuracy higher than 90%, which is comparable to previous works. Conclusions: Unlike most of previous works, which were mainly based on quantifying the irregular ventricular response during AF, the proposed metric presents two major advantages. First, it can perform successfully even under heart rates with no variability. Second, it consists of a single metric, thus turning its clinical interpretation and real-time implementation easier than previous methods requiring combined indices under complex classifiers.

N2  - © 2016 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine. False intensive care unit (ICU) alarms induce stress in both patients and clinical staff and decrease the quality of care, thus significantly increasing both the hospital recovery time and rehospitalization rates. In the PhysioNet/CinC Challenge 2015 for reducing false arrhythmia alarms in ICU bedside monitor data, this paper validates the application of a real-time arrhythmia detection library (ADLib, Schiller AG) for the robust detection of five types of life-threatening arrhythmia alarms. The strength of the application is to give immediate feedback on the arrhythmia event within a scan interval of 3 s-7.5 s, and to increase the noise immunity of electrocardiogram (ECG) arrhythmia analysis by fusing its decision with supplementary ECG quality interpretation and real-time pulse wave monitoring (quality and hemodynamics) using arterial blood pressure or photoplethysmographic signals. We achieved the third-ranked real-time score (79.41) in the challenge (Event 1), however, the rank was not officially recognized due to the 'closed-source' entry. This study shows the optimization of the alarm decision module, using tunable parameters such as the scan interval, lead quality threshold, and pulse wave features, with a follow-up improvement of the real-time score (80.07). The performance (true positive rate, true negative rate) is reported in the blinded challenge test set for different arrhythmias: asystole (83%, 96%), extreme bradycardia (100%, 90%), extreme tachycardia (98%, 80%), ventricular tachycardia (84%, 82%), and ventricular fibrillation (78%, 84%). Another part of this study considers the validation of ADLib with four reference ECG databases (AHA, EDB, SVDB, MIT-BIH) according to the international recommendations for performance reports in ECG monitors (ANSI/AAMI EC57). The sensitivity (Se) and positive predictivity (+P) are: QRS detector QRS (Se, +P) > 99.7%, ventricular ectopic beat (VEB) classifier VEB (Se, +P) = 95%, and ventricular fibrillation detector VFIB (P + = 94.8%) > VFIB (Se = 86.4%), adjusted to the clinical setting requirements, giving preference to low false positive alarms.

N2  - © 2016 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine. This study developed algorithms to decrease the arrhythmia false alarms in the ICU by processing multimodal signals of photoplethysmography (PPG), arterial blood pressure (ABP), and two ECG signals. The goal was to detect the five critical arrhythmias comprising asystole (ASY), extreme bradycardia (EBR), extreme tachycardia (ETC), ventricular tachycardia (VTA), and ventricular flutter or fibrillation (VFB). The different characteristics of the arrhythmias suggested the application of individual signal processing for each alarm and the combination of the algorithms to enhance false alarm detection. Thus, different features and signal processing techniques were used for each arrhythmia type. The ECG signals were first processed to reduce the signal interference. Then, a Hilbert-transform based QRS detector algorithm was utilized to identify the QRS complexes, which were then processed to determine the instantaneous heart rate. The pulsatile signals (PPG and ABP) were processed to discover the pulse onset of beats which were then employed to measure the heart rate. The signal quality index (SQI) of the signals was implemented to verify the integrity of the heart rate information. The overall score obtained by our algorithms in the 2015 Computing in Cardiology Challenge was a score of 74.03% for retrospective and 69.92% for real-time analysis.

N2  - © 2016 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine. There has been a high rate of false alarms for the critical electrocardiogram (ECG) arrhythmia events in intensive care units (ICUs), from which the 'crying-wolf' syndrome may be resulted and patient safety may be jeopardized. This article presents an algorithm to reduce false critical arrhythmia alarms using arterial blood pressure (ABP) and/or photoplethysmogram (PPG) waveform features. We established long duration reference alarm datasets which consist of 573 ICU waveform-alarm records (283 for development set and 290 for test set) with total length of 551 patent days. Each record has continuous recordings of ECGs, ABP and/or PPG signals and contains one or multiple critical ECG alarms. The average length of a record is 23 h. There are totally 2408 critical ECG alarms (1414 in the development set and 994 in the test set), each of which was manually annotated by experts. The algorithm extracts ABP/PPG pulse features on a beat-by-beat basis. For each pulse, five event feature indicators (EFIs), which correspond to the five critical ECG alarms, are generated. At the time of a critical ECG alarm, the corresponding EFI values of those ABP/PPG pulses around the alarm time are checked for adjudicating (accept/reject) this alarm. The algorithm retains all (100%) the true alarms and significantly reduces the false alarms. Our results suggest that the algorithm is effective and practical on account of its real-time dynamic processing mechanism and computational efficiency.

N2  - © 2016 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine. Our approach to detecting false arrhythmia alarms in the intensive care unit breaks down into several tasks. It involves beat detection on different signals: electrocardiogram, photoplethysmogram and arterial blood pressure. The quality of each channel has to be estimated in order to evaluate the reliability of obtained beat detections. The information about the heart rate from the different channels must be integrated in order to find a final conclusion. Some alarm types require particular detectors as is the case of ventricular fibrillation. To identify false ventricular tachycardia alarms we needed to classify heart beats as normal/ventricular. For that purpose we introduce a new feature, QRS polarity type. This feature was important in order to reduce misclassification of ventricular beats: there was an improvement in the ventricular tachycardia alarm true positive rate from 69% to 81%. However, the true negative rate was reduced from 95% to 69% and our global challenge score (real-time event) dropped from 79.02 to 74.28. Our challenge algorithm achieved the third best score in the 2015 PhysioNet/CinC challenge event 1 (real time).

The proposed model enables users to improve health related risks and reduce healthcare costs by collecting, recording, analyzing and sharing large data streams in real time and efficiently. The idea of this project came so to reduce the headache of patient to visit to doctor every time he need to check his blood pressure, heart beat rate, temperature etc. With the help of this proposal the time of both patients and doctors are saved and doctors can also help in emergency scenario as much as possible. The proposed outcome of the project is to give proper and efficient medical services to patients by connecting and collecting data information through health status monitors which would include patient's heart rate, blood pressure and ECG and sends an emergency alert to patient's doctor with his current status and full medical information.

Purpose: To compare the impact of a 100 kV tube voltage protocol to 120 kV in terms of image quality and radiation dose by a 320 row coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) with automatic exposure control (AEC). Materials and methods: Using a propensity matched analysis we compared a group of 135 patients scanned using a 100 kV tube voltage protocol with a group of 135 subjects scanned employing a 120 kV tube voltage setting. In all subjects the heart rate (HR) was <65 bpm and all CT scans were acquired using a prospective ECG gating and AEC strategy. Mean effective radiation dose and subjective and objective (Noise or N, signal to noise ratio or SNR, contrast to noise ratio or CNR) image quality, were evaluated. Subjective quality was assessed by two experienced radiologists using a 5-point scale (0: non diagnostic—4: excellent) using the 15-segment American Heart Association (AHA) coronary artery classification. Results: Mean effective dose and noise were non significantly different between the two groups: mean effective dose was 2.89 ± 0.7 mSv in the 100 kV group and 2.80 ± 0.57 mSv in the 120 kV group (p = 0.25) while noise was 28.9 ± 3.3 in the 120 kV group and 29.05 ± 3.6 in the 100 kV group (p = 0.72). Both SNR and CNR were significantly higher in the 100 kV group than in the 120 kV group. This data agrees with the evidence that subjective quality was significantly higher in the 100 kV group in the middle and distal segmental classes. Conclusion: Our study shows that, in using a 320 row CCTA with AEC strategy it is better to employ a 100 kV tube voltage protocol because compared to 120 kV tube voltage setting, it appears to significantly improve both subjective and objective image quality without decreasing the mean effective radiation dose.

N2  - © 2016 Heilongjiang Institute of Science and Technology Information. All rights reserved. Objective: To explore the incidence, causal factors and prognosis of acute cor pulmonale (ACP) complicating H7N9 influenza virus infection. Methods: A retrospective study was conducted. Twenty-one laboratory-confirmed H7N9 patients who required intensive care during March 2013 to September 2015 in the Affiliated First Hospital of Soochow University and Suzhou 5th People's Hospital were enrolled. The ACP was defined as right ventricular (RV) dilatation with a paradoxical septal motion at end-systole. All patients were divided into two groups (ACP group and non-ACP group), and the clinical data of all patients were analyzed retrospectively. The presentation, mechanical ventilation (MV) setting, the characteristics of bedside electrocardiogram (ECG) and echocardiography between the two groups were compared and analyzed. Results: Six of 21 patients with H7N9 influenza virus infection developed ACP during hospitalization with the incidence of 28.6%, and with the presentation of tachycardia, unstabilized hemodynamics and decreased pulse blood oxygen saturation (SpO2). The media time from onset of influenza symptom to ACP occurrence was 11.00(6.25, 20.50) days. On the day of ACP occurrence, the worst value of heart rate was (102.83 ± 20.53) bpm, mean arterial pressure was (81.83 ± 12.14) mmHg (1 mmHg = 0.133 kPa), and oxygenation index was (132.40±74.90) mmHg, and SpO2 was 0.863±0.051, there were no statistically significant differences in above parameters as compared with those of non-ACP group except SpO2. The media from MV to ACP occurrence was 3.50(1.75, 6.75) days. The level of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and airway plateau pressure (Pplat) in ACP group were significantly higher than those of non-ACP group [PEEP (cmH2O, 1 cmH2O = 0.098 kPa):15.17 ± 3.71 vs. 11.73 ±2.57, Pplat (cmH2O):27.50 ± 1.05 vs. 23.09 ±4.37, both P < 0.05]. The incidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and septic shock in ACP group were slightly higher than those of non-ACP group (83.3% vs. 53.3%, 50.0% vs. 26.7%, both P > 0.05). The proportion of right axis deviation in ACP group was significantly higher than that of non-ACP group (83.3% vs. 13.3%, P < 0.01), moderate-to-severe tricuspid regurgitation (TR) and inferior vena cava (IVC) collapse-index less than 50% were more common in ACP patients as compared with those of non-ACP patients (100.0% vs. 60.0%, P > 0.05; 100.0% vs. 20.0%, P < 0.01). The value of tricuspid regurgitation pressure gradient (TRPG) and IVC diameter in ACP group were significantly higher than those of non-ACP group [TRPG (mmHg):45.00 ± 8.65 vs. 28.01 ±9.02, IVC diameter (mm):2.25±0.14 vs. 1.87±0.15, both P < 0.01]. No statistical difference in acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II) and sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) were found between ACP and non-ACP groups (23.33 ±7.06 vs. 19.27 ±5.50, 7.33 ± 1.21 vs. 7.80 ±3.01, both P > 0.05), while the intensive care unit (ICU) mortality in ACP patients was significantly higher than that of non-ACP patients (83.3% vs. 26.7%, P < 0.05). Conclusions: The prevalence of ACP in critically ill patients with H7N9 influenza virus infection was high. MV was an important factor responsible for the development of ACP with severe H7N9 influenza virus infection. Strengthen the monitoring and management of RV dysfunction at early stage was indispensable because of the poor prognosis and non specificity clinical symptoms of ACP in severe H7N9 virus infected patients.

N2  - © 2016 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine. False arrhythmia alarms pose a major threat to the quality of care in today's ICU. Thus, the PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2015 aimed at reducing false alarms by exploiting multimodal cardiac signals recorded by a patient monitor. False alarms for asystole, extreme bradycardia, extreme tachycardia, ventricular flutter/fibrillation as well as ventricular tachycardia were to be reduced using two electrocardiogram channels, up to two cardiac signals of mechanical origin as well as a respiratory signal. In this paper, an approach combining multimodal rhythmicity estimation and machine learning is presented. Using standard short-time autocorrelation and robust beat-to-beat interval estimation, the signal's self-similarity is analyzed. In particular, beat intervals as well as quality measures are derived which are further quantified using basic mathematical operations (min, mean, max, etc). Moreover, methods from the realm of image processing, 2D Fourier transformation combined with principal component analysis, are employed for dimensionality reduction. Several machine learning approaches are evaluated including linear discriminant analysis and random forest. Using an alarm-independent reduction strategy, an overall false alarm reduction with a score of 65.52 in terms of the real-time scoring system of the challenge is achieved on a hidden dataset. Employing an alarm-specific strategy, an overall real-time score of 78.20 at a true positive rate of 95% and a true negative rate of 78% is achieved. While the results for some categories still need improvement, false alarms for extreme tachycardia are suppressed with 100% sensitivity and specificity.

N2  - © 2016 John Wiley  &  Sons Ltd Aims: This study aims to compare different doses of magnesium administered via cardioplegic solutions to prevent atrial fibrillation (AF) after coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. Methods: A total of 120 patients who were scheduled for elective CABG surgery using cardiopulmonary bypass were enrolled in this double-blind, randomized clinical trial. After fulfilling the inclusion criteria, they were randomly allocated into three groups (A, B, and C). Patients in groups A, B, and C received 60, 80, and 100 mg/kg of magnesium sulfate via cardioplegic solutions during aortic cross-clamp, respectively. Postoperative AF was assessed by continuous ECG monitoring during 3 days after surgery. Also serum magnesium, potassium, and calcium levels were assessed during the study period. Results: The findings revealed significant differences in four point measurements of serum magnesium level after surgery (P<.001). In particular, it was observed that 10 (26.3%) patients in group A, 4 (10%) patients in group B, and 2 (5.4%) patients in group C had AF after surgery. This indicates patients receiving magnesium at doses of 80 and 100 mg/kg had lower rates of AF occurrence than those receiving 60 mg/kg dose of magnesium (P=.02). Additionally, no significant difference was found in serum calcium and potassium concentration between the three groups throughout the study period. Conclusion: Magnesium administration via the cardioplegic solution during aortic cross-clamping at doses of 80 and 100 mg/kg can reduce the risk of AF occurrence after CABG compared to the dose of 60 mg/kg. Considering the lower rate of AF incidence and shorter length of ICU stay in patients receiving 100 mg/kg of magnesium, it seems reasonable to administer 100 mg/kg magnesium during aortic cross-clamp to prevent postoperative AF.

N2  - © Copyright AAMI 2016. Background: Although electrocardiographic monitoring is valuable for continuous surveillance of intensive care unit (ICU) patients, false alarms are common and have been cited as a cause of alarm fatigue. ANSI/ AAMI EC12:2002 states that electrocardiograms (ECGs) should not detect a QRS if the waveform is less than 0.15 mV (1.5 mm) for adult patients, in order to avoid mislabeling P waves or baseline noise as QRSs during complete heart block or asystole. However, ECG software algorithms often use more conservative QRS thresholds, which may result in false-positive asystole alarms in patients with low-amplitude QRS complexes. Objectives: To 1) assess the frequency of low QRS amplitude in a group of ICU patients with one or more false-positive asystole alarms and 2) determine whether low-amplitude QRSs are associated with false-positive asystole alarms during continuous ECG monitoring. Methods: Hospital-acquired standard 12-lead ECGs were examined in a group of 82 ICU patients who had one or more falsepositive asystole alarms. Low QRS amplitude was deined as a unidirectional (only positive or negative) QRS of less than 5 mm in two of four leads (I, II, III, and V1). Results: Low-amplitude QRSs were present in 45 of 82 (55%) patients. The presence of low-amplitude QRSs did not difer according to age, sex, or race. Patients treated in the cardiac ICU had the highest proportion of low-amplitude QRSs. An equivalent proportion of patients had false-positive asystole alarms by group (no low-amplitude QRSs 95% vs. low-amplitude QRSs 87%; P = 0.229). Eight patients (10%) had both true- and false-positive asystole alarms (two [5%] with no low-amplitude QRSs and six [13%] with low-amplitude QRSs; P = 0.229). Conclusion: Low-amplitude QRS, as assessed from hospital 12-lead ECGs, occurs frequently and is more common in cardiac ICU patients. However, this ECG feature did not identify patients with false-positive asystole alarms during continuous ECG monitoring.

N2  - © 2016 IEEE. Computerized interpretation of the electrocardiogram (ECG) is increasingly used to assist clinician experts to reduce times to reperfusion for patients suspected of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). In this context, we have developed a system based on Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) for automatic detection of STEMI, using the MicroBlaze soft processor from Xilinx. More particularly, this work aims the implementation of an efficient knowledge-based 4-step algorithm for STEMI diagnosis, using the 12-lead ECG. We have used the Nexys 3 board from Digilent as development tool, and different ECG databases from Physiobank, containing the conventional 12-lead ECG. The implementation performance was tested mainly with 8 records of 12-lead ECG, i.e. 96 ECG signals, providing a sensitivity of 62.5%, with a QRS detection reaching an accuracy of 99.41%. The implementation occupied 97% of the slices of the used FPGA, namely the Spartan 6 XC6SLX16 from Xilinx. To our knowledge, this successful FPGA-based implementation for STEMI detection is novel and authentic.

N2  - Background: Heart rate variability indices (HRV) are prognostic marker in cardiovascular diseases. However, the prognostic value and pathophysiological role of HRVs in intensive care patients (ICU-pts) are not fully investigated. We compared HRVs [including non-linear index of long-term fractal β (fractal-β)] with Acute Physiologic and Chronic Health Evaluation III Score (APACHE III) and serum cytokine levels. The former is well-known prognostic index and the latter is indices reflecting various pathophysiological conditions in ICU-pts. Methods: HRVs were obtained from 24-hour ECG monitoring in 80 ICU-pts including 27 post-surgical pts with cardiac complications (67 ± 8 years old) and 53 pts with acute coronary syndrome (65 ± 13 years old). APACHE III was calculated and blood samples were obtained for cytokine measurement by ELIZA method at the time of pts admission to ICU. Cytokines that we measured were IL1β, IIA, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12 (p70), IL-13, IL-15, IL-17, G-CSF, INFγ, TNFα and MIP-1α. HRVs included fractal-β and mean-HR, SDANN, SD-index, pNN50, rMSSD, total frequency spectra fTF), very low frequency spectra (VLF), low frequency spectra (LF), high frequency spectra (HF) and LF/HF ratio. Results: Among HRVs, rMSSD and pNN50 correlated with APACHE III, respectively (r = 0.29 and r = 0.23, p < 0.05). On the other hand, fractal-β correlated with IL-13 and INF-γ (r = 0.26 and r = 0.26, p < 0.05) while mean-HR correlated with IL-8 (r = 0.27, p < 0.05) and SD-index with INF-γ and TNFα (r = 0.33, p < 0.01 and r = 0.28, p < 0.05). In addition, TF correlated with IL-12 (p70) (r = 0.35, p < 0.01) and VLF correlated with IL-12 (p70) and INF-γ (r = 0.26, p < 0.05 and r = 0.39, p < 0.001) while LF with IL-12 and INF-γ (r = 0.25 and r = 0.25, p < 0.05) as well as LF/HF ratio with IL-1β, IL-4, IL-13 and IL-8 (r = 0.23, r = 0.24, r = 0.24 and r = 0.28, p < 0.05). IL-8 correlated with APACHE III (r = 0.30, p < 0.01). Conclusions: Among HRVs and cytokines, rMSSD, pNN50 and IL-8 are associated with the prognosis and many HRVs reflect various immune and inflammatory state in ICU. Measuring HRVs gives us prognostic and pathophysiological information in ICU-pts with cardiac complications.

N2  - © 2016 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine. The purpose of this study was to develop algorithms to lower the incidence of false arrhythmia alarms in the ICU using information from independent sources, namely electrocardiogram (ECG), arterial blood pressure (ABP) and photoplethysmogram (PPG). Our approach relies on robust adaptive signal processing techniques in order to extract accurate heart rate (HR) values from the different waveforms. Based on the quality of available signals, heart rate was either estimated from pulsatile waveforms using an adaptive frequency tracking algorithm or computed from ECGs using an adaptive mathematical morphology approach. Furthermore, we developed a supplementary measure based on the spectral purity of the ECGs to determine whether a ventricular tachycardia or flutter/fibrillation arrhythmia has taken place. Finally, alarm veracity was determined based on a set of decision rules on HR and spectral purity values. The proposed method was evaluated on the PhysioNet/CinC Challenge 2015 database, which is composed of 1250 life-threatening alarm recordings, each categorized into either bradycardia, tachycardia, asystole, ventricular tachycardia or ventricular flutter/fibrillation arrhythmia. This resulted in overall true positive rates of 95%/99% and overall true negative rates of 76%/80% on the real-time and retrospective subsets of the test dataset, respectively.

Objectives: To determine the feasibility of automated co-registration of angiography and intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) to facilitate integration of these two imaging modalities in a synchronous manner. Background: IVUS provides cross-sectional imaging of coronary arteries but lacks overview of the vascular territory provided by angiography. Co-registration of angiography and IVUS would increase utility of IVUS in the clinical setting. Methods: Forty-nine consecutive patients undergoing surveillance for cardiac allograft vasculopathy with angiography and IVUS of the left anterior descending artery (LAD) were enrolled. A pre-IVUS angiogram of the LAD was performed followed by an ECG-triggered fluoroscopy (ECGTF) during IVUS pullback at 0.5 mm/s using an automatic pullback device. ECGTF was used to track the IVUS catheter during pullback and establish a spatial relationship to the pre-IVUS angiogram. Angio-IVUS co-registration was performed with a research prototype (Siemens Healthcare, Germany) and accuracy was evaluated by distance mismatch between angiography and IVUS images at vessel bifurcations. Results: Median age was 54 (44.5, 67) years. The population was 82.6% male with minimal risk factors. The median (IQR) co-registration distance mismatch measured at 108 bifurcations in 42 (85%) patients was 0.35 (0.00–1.16) mm. Seven patients were excluded due to inappropriate data acquisition (n = 3) and failure of tracking (n = 4), e.g., due to overlapping sternal wires. Estimated effective radiation dose for ECGTF was 0.09 mSv. Conclusion: This study demonstrates the feasibility of angio-IVUS co-registration which may be used as a clinical tool for localizing IVUS cross-sections along an angiographic roadmap. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ECG from 70 mechanically ventilated adult patients with administered sedatives in an ICU setting were used to develop a support vector machine based system for sedation depth monitoring using several heart rate variability measures. A leave-one-subject-out cross validation was used for classifier training and performance evaluations. The proposed patient-specific system provided a sensitivity, specificity and an AUC of 64%, 84.8% and 0.72, respectively. It is hoped that with the help of additional physiological signals the proposed patient-specific sedation level prediction system could lead to a fully automated multimodal system to assist clinical staff in ICUs to interpret the sedation level of the patient.

N2  - © 2016 IEEE. Automated detection and classification of electrocardiogram (ECG) noise sources can play a crucial role in reliable measurement of ECG parameters for accurate diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) under unsupervised telehealth monitoring and intensive care unit (ICU) applications. Although the methods had quite acceptable detection rates, most methods are too complicated for real-time implementation for wearable cardiac health monitoring devices. Therefore, in this paper, we present a low-complexity algorithm for automatically detecting and classifying the ECG noises including flat line (FL), time-varying noise (TVN), baseline wander (BW), abrupt change (ABC), muscle artifact (MA) and power line interference (PLI). The proposed method is based on the moving average (MAv) and derivative filters and the five temporal features including turning points, global and local amplitude estimates, zerocrossing and autocorrelation peak values. The proposed method is tested and validated using a wide variety of clean and noisy ECG signals taken from the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database and Physionet Challenge database. The method achieves an average sensitivity (Se) of 98.55%, positive productivity (+P) of 95.27% and overall accuracy (OA) of 94.19% for classifying the noises. Results show that the proposed method outperforms the other existing methods.

N2  - © 2016 Elsevier Inc. Background Most patients presenting with suspected acute coronary syndrome (ACS) are admitted to telemetry units. While telemetry is an appropriate level of care, acute complications requiring a higher level of care in the intensive care unit (ICU) occur. Purpose Among patients admitted to telemetry for suspected ACS, we determine the frequency of unplanned ICU transfer, and examine whether ECG changes indicative of myocardial ischemia, and/or symptoms preceded unplanned transfer. Method This was a secondary analysis from a study assessing occurrence rates for transient myocardial ischemia (TMI) using a 12-lead Holter. Clinicians were blinded to Holter data as it was used in the context research; off-line analysis was performed post discharge. Hospital telemetry monitoring was maintained as per hospital protocol. TMI was defined as >1 mm ST-segment ↑ or ↓, in >1 ECG lead, >1 minute. Symptoms were assessed by chart review. Results In 409 patients (64 ± 13 years), most were men (60%), Caucasian (93%), and had a history of coronary artery disease (47%). Unplanned transfer to the ICU occurred in 9 (2.2%), was equivalent by gender, and age (no transfer 64 ± 13 years vs transfer 67 ± 11 years). Four patients were transferred following unsuccessful percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) attempt, four due to recurrent angina, and one due to renal and hepatic failure. Mean time from admission to transfer was 13 ± 6 hours, mean time to ECG detected ischemia was 6 ± 5 hours, and 8.8 ± 5 hours for symptoms prompting transfer. In two patients ECG detected ischemia and acute symptoms prompting transfer were simultaneous. In five patients, ECG detected ischemia was clinically silent. All patients eventually had symptoms that prompted transfer to the ICU. In all nine patients, there was no documentation or nursing notes regarding bedside ECG monitor changes prior to unplanned transfer. Hospital length of stay was longer in the unplanned transfer group (2 days ± 2 versus 6 days ± 4; p = 0.018). Conclusions In patients with suspected ACS, while unplanned transfer from telemetry to ICU is uncommon, it is associated with prolonged hospitalization. Two primary scenarios were identified; (1) following unsuccessful PCI, and (2) recurrent angina. Symptoms prompting unplanned transfer occurred, but happened on average 8.8 hours after hospital admission; whereas ECG detected ischemia preceding unplanned transfer occurred on average 6 hours after hospital admission.

N2  - The aim of this study is to detect Acute Hypotensive Episodes (AHE) and Mean Arterial Pressure Dropping Regimes (MAPDRs) using ECG signal and Arterial Blood Pressure waveforms. To meet this end, the QRS complexes and end-systolic end-diastolic pulses are first extracted using two innovative Modified Hilbert Transform-Based algorithms namely as ECGMHT and BPMHT. A new smoothing algorithm is next developed based on piecewise polynomial fitting to smooth the fast fluctuations observed in RR-tachogram, systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) trends. Afterwards, in order to consider the mutual influence of parameters on the evaluation of shock probability, a Sugeno Adaptive Network-based Fuzzy Inference System-ANFIS is trained using Hasdai et al. (J Am Coll Cardiol, 35: 136-143, 2000) parameters as input, with appropriate membership functions for each parameter. Using this network, it will be possible to incorporate the possible mutual influences between risk parameters such as heart rate, SBP, DBP, ST-segment episodes, age, gender, weight and some miscellaneous factors to the calculation of shock occurrence probability. In the next step, the proposed algorithm is applied to 15 subjects of the MIMIC II Database and AHE and MAPDRs (MAP ≤ 60 mmHg with a period of 30 min or more) are identified. As a result of this study, for a sequence of MAPDRs as long as 20 min or more, there will exist a consequent high peak with the duration of 3-4 min in the corresponding probability of cardiogenic shock diagram. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

N2  - To present an efficient and robust method for 3-D reconstruction of the coronary artery tree from multiple ECG-gated views of an X-ray angiography. 2-D coronary artery centerlines are extracted automatically from X-ray projection images using an enhanced multi-scale analysis. For the difficult data with low vessel contrast, a semi-automatic tool based on fast marching method is implemented to allow manual correction of automatically-extracted 2-D centerlines. First, we formulate the 3-D symbolic reconstruction of coronary arteries from multiple views as an energy minimization problem incorporating a soft epipolar line constraint and a smoothness term evaluated in 3-D. The proposed formulation results in the robustness of the reconstruction to the imperfectness in 2-D centerline extraction, as well as the reconstructed coronary artery tree being inherently smooth in 3-D. We further propose to solve the energy minimization problem using α-expansion moves of Graph Cuts, a powerful optimization technique that yields a local minimum in a strong sense at a relatively low computational complexity. We show experimental results on a synthetic coronary phantom, a porcine data set and 11 patient data sets. For the coronary phantom, results obtained using different number of views are presented. 3-D reconstruction error evaluated by the mean plus one standard deviation is below one millimeter when 4 or more views are used. For real data, reconstruction using 4 to 5 views and 256 depth labels averaged around 12 s on a computer with 2.13 GHz Intel Pentium M and achieves a mean 2-D back-projection error of 1.18 mm (ranging from 0.84 to 1.71 mm) in 12 cases. The accuracy for multi-view reconstruction of the coronary artery tree as reported from the phantom and patient studies is promising, and the efficiency is significantly improved compared to other approaches reported in the literature, which range from a few to tens of minutes. Visually good and smooth reconstruction is demonstrated. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, B.V.

N2  - Purpose: To evaluate the feasibility of an automatic, whole-heart segmentation algorithm for measuring global heart function from gated, whole-chest MDCT images. Material and methods: 15 patients with suspicion of PE underwent whole-chest contrast-enhanced MDCT with retrospective ECG synchronization. Two observers computed right and left ventricular functional indices using a semi-manual and an automatic whole-heart segmentation algorithm. The two techniques were compared using Bland-Altman analysis and paired Student's t-test. Measurement reproducibility was calculated using intraclass correlation coefficient. Results: Ventricular analysis with automatic segmentation was successful in 13/15 (86%) and in 15/15 (100%) patients for the right ventricle and left ventricle, respectively. Reproducibility of measurements for both ventricles was perfect (ICC: 1.00) and very good for automatic and semi-manual measurements, respectively. Ventricular volumes and functional indices except right ventricular ejection fraction obtained from the automatic method were significantly higher for the RV compared to the semi-manual methods. Conclusions: The automatic, whole-heart segmentation algorithm enabled highly reproducible global heart function to be rapidly obtained in patients undergoing gated whole-chest MDCT for assessment of acute chest pain with suspicion of pulmonary embolism. © 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

N2  - Background: Patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) setting are prone to malignant ventricular arrhythmias. We sought to test whether electrocardiographic (ECG) markers of autonomic tone, ventricular irritability, and repolarization lability could be used in short-term prediction of ventricular arrhythmias in this patient population. Methods: We studied 38 patients with sustained (>30 seconds) monomorphic ventricular tachycardia, polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, or ventricular fibrillation while monitored in the ICU and 30 patients without arrhythmia in the ICU who served as controls. All patients had at least 12 hours of continuously recorded multilead ECG before arrhythmic event. Mean heart rate and measures of heart rate variability, QT variability, and ventricular ectopy were quantified in 1-hour epochs for the 12 hours before the arrhythmic event and in 5-minute epochs for the last hour preevent (and using a random termination time point in controls). Results: A modest downward trend in QT variability and a rise in heart rate were observed hours before polymorphic ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation events, although no significant changes heralded monomorphic ventricular tachycardia and no changes in any parameter predicted imminent ventricular arrhythmia of any type. There were no significant differences in ECG parameters between arrhythmia patients and controls. Conclusions: In ICU patients, sustained ventricular arrhythmias are not preceded by change in ECG measures of autonomic tone, repolarization variability, and ventricular ectopy. Short-term arrhythmia prediction may be difficult or impossible in this patient population based on ECG measures alone. © 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - This paper addresses principal issues of the ECG interpretation adaptivity in a distributed surveillance network. In the age of pervasive access to wireless digital communication, distributed biosignal interpretation networks may not only optimally solve difficult medical cases, but also adapt the data acquisition, interpretation, and transmission to the variable patients status and availability of technical resources. The background of such adaptivity is the innovative use of results from the automatic ECG analysis to the seamless remote modification of the interpreting software. Since the medical relevance of issued diagnostic data depends on the patients status, the interpretation adaptivity implies the flexibility of report content and frequency. Proposed solutions are based on the research on human experts behavior, procedures reliability, and usage statistics. Despite the limited scale of our prototype clientserver application, the tests yielded very promising results: the transmission channel occupation was reduced by 2.6 to 5.6 times comparing to the rigid reporting mode and the improvement of the remotely computed diagnostic outcome was achieved in case of over 80% of software adaptation attempts. © 2009 IEEE.

N2  - The purpose of this study was to test whether oxygen carriers could decrease tissue injury in a rat model of acute myocardial infarct. The study included 3 groups: SD rats in group II and group III were subjected to permanent occlusion of their left anterior descending coronary arteries; SD rats in group I were subjected to sham-operation. The success of modeling was assartained by ECG. Then the rats were given drug via caudal veins for 2 days. A quantitative evaluation was made with an automatic device for interpretation of cardiac troponin T (cTnT); heart staining was made for the calculation of myocardial infarction size (MIS); and myocardial tissue was taken and subjected to routine pathological hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining for showing myocardial cell injury. cTnT in the sham-operation group was significantly lower by comparison with that in the model group (P < 0.01), and it was slightly lower in the oxygen carriers group than that in the model group, but there was no statistically significant difference (P = 0.18); MIS was significantly smaller in the sham-operation group than that in the model group (P < 0.01), and it was greater in the model rats than that in the oxygen carriers rats (P < 0.05). HE staining of myocardicum in the oxygen carriers group was significantly better than that in the model group (P < 0.01). The evidence suggested that oxygen carriers increased oxygen supply to ischemic myocardium, reduced the myocardial injury, and thus might offer a novel treatment of myocardial infarction.

N2  - This paper addresses principles of discrete nonlinear control performed towards the diagnostic quality-based interpretive software optimization for cardiology-based monitoring system. Thanks to the pervasive access to wireless digital communication, distributed biosignal interpretation networks may not only optimally solve difficult medical cases, but also adapt the data acquisition, interpretation and transmission to the variable patient's status and availability of technical resources. The adaptation is based on the innovative use of results from the automatic ECG analysis to the seamless remote modification of the interpreting software. This paper focuses on the static properties and control accuracy and dynamic properties of the ECG processing optimization. It provides also details on the automatic scoring of the performance of ECG interpretation procedures. Testing of the prototype, despite its limited scale, yields significant quantitative benefits and improvement of diagnostic quality. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

N2  - Objective: The amplitude of R-wave in DII lead (RDII) has been shown to correlate to central blood volume in animal and healthy volunteers. The aim of this study was to assess if change in RDII (ΔRDII) after passive leg rise (PLR) and fluid loading would allow detecting preload dependence in intensive care ventilated patients. This parameter was compared to concomitant changes in pulse arterial pressure (ΔPP). Methods: Observational study in 40 stable sedated and ventilated cardiac surgery patients studied postoperatively. In line with our routine practice we performed a 45° passive leg rise (PLR1) to detect preload dependence. If cardiac index or DPP rose more than 12 and 13%, respectively, the patient was declared as non-responder (NR) to fluid loading. If these criteria were not met, they were declared as responders (R) and received a 500 ml of gelatin fluid loading (FL) followed by a second passive leg rise (PLR2). Hemodynamic parameters were assessed during each maneuver using their indwelling Swan-Ganz and radial catheter. Results: We identified 16 R and 24 NR whose hemodynamic parameters did not differ at basal condition, except ΔPP (19% ± 7 in R vs. 7% ± 4 in NR, P ± 0.001). PLR1 did not elicit any hemodynamic change in NR. In R, DPP decreased and SV rose, both significantly (P < 0.001) whereas ΔRDII did not vary. FL induced a more pronounced change in these parameters. Conclusions: ΔRDII in response to PLR does not successfully help identifying preload dependent patients contrarily to ΔPP or change in stroke volume. © Springer 2010.

N2  - Background. Telemedicine is a relatively young way of practising medicine based on data remote transfer. High density ECG (ECG-HD) is the method that allows improving signal resolution according to the standard one. In our department we have found this technique interesting and potentially helpful for family doctors, and we have decided to check its reliability. Material and methods. 48 healthy students took part in the survey - 23 male and 25 female - aged 20-27. All participants have negated presence of arterial hypertension, ischemic heart disease, and dysrythmia. ECG-HD was performed by the skilled medical stuff. Results. Automatic computerised interpretation of the ECG-HD signal has revealed that 89.6% of analyses might have ischemic heart disorders. Meanwhile an intern skilled in ECG reading has excluded such possibility in all ECG records. Conclusions. We find ECG-HD not useful in family medicine practice due to its very low specificity and oversensitivity in diagnosing ischemic heart disorders. © Wydawnictwo Continuo.

N2  - A fully automated, intrinsic gating algorithm for small animal cone-beam CT is described and evaluated. A parameter representing the organ motion, derived from the raw projection images, is used for both cardiac and respiratory gating. The proposed algorithm makes it possible to reconstruct motion-corrected still images as well as to generate four-dimensional (4D) datasets representing the cardiac and pulmonary anatomy of free-breathing animals without the use of electrocardiogram (ECG) or respiratory sensors. Variation analysis of projections from several rotations is used to place a region of interest (ROI) on the diaphragm. The ROI is cranially extended to include the heart. The centre of mass (COM) variation within this ROI, the filtered frequency response and the local maxima are used to derive a binary motion-gating parameter for phase-sensitive gated reconstruction. This algorithm was implemented on a flat-panel-based cone-beam CT scanner and evaluated using a moving phantom and animal scans (seven rats and eight mice). Volumes were determined using a semiautomatic segmentation. In all cases robust gating signals could be obtained. The maximum volume error in phantom studies was less than 6%. By utilizing extrinsic gating via externally placed cardiac and respiratory sensors, the functional parameters (e.g. cardiac ejection fraction) and image quality were equivalent to this current gold standard. This algorithm obviates the necessity of both gating hardware and user interaction. The simplicity of the proposed algorithm enables adoption in a wide range of small animal cone-beam CT scanners. © 2010 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.

N2  - Intensive care unit (ICU) monitors have alarm options to intimate the staff of critical incidents but these alarms needs to be adjusted in every patient. With this objective in mind, this study was done among resident doctors, with the aim of assessing the existing attitude among resident doctors towards ICU alarm settings. This study was conducted among residents working at ICU of a multispeciality centre, with the help of a printed questionnaire. The study involved 80 residents. All residents were in full agreement on routine use of ECG, pulse oximeter, capnograph and NIBP monitoring. 86% residents realised the necessity of monitoring oxygen concentration, apnoea monitoring and expired minute ventilation monitoring. 87% PGs and 70% SRs routinely checked alarm limits for various parameters. 50% PGs and 46.6% SRs set these alarm limits. The initial response to an alarm among all the residents was to disable the alarm temporarily and try to look for a cause. 92% of PGs and 98% of SRs were aware of alarms priority and colour coding. 55% residents believed that the alarm occurred due to patient disturbance, 15% believed that alarm was due to technical problem with monitor/sensor and 30% thought it was truly related to patient's clinical status. 82% residents set the alarms by themselves, 10% believed that alarms should be adjusted by nurse, 4% believed the technical staff should take responsibility of setting alarm limits and 4% believed that alarm levels should be pre-adjusted by the manufacturer. We conclude that although alarms are an important, indispensable, and lifesaving feature, they can be a nuisance and can compromise quality and safety of care by frequent false positive alarms. We should be familiar of the alarm modes, check and reset the alarm settings at regular interval or after a change in clinical status of the patient.

N2  - The introduction of slip ring technology enables helical CT scanning in the late 1980's and has rejuvenated CT's role in diagnostic imaging. Helical CT scanning has made possible whole body scanning in a single breath hold and computed tomography angiography (CTA) which has replaced invasive catheter based angiography in many cases because of its easy of operation and lesser risk to patients. However, a series of recent articles and accidents have heightened the concern of radiation risk from CT scanning. Undoubtedly, the radiation dose from CT studies, in particular, CCTA studies, are among the highest dose studies in diagnostic imaging. Nevertheless, CT has remained the workhorse of diagnostic imaging in emergent and non-emergent situations because of their ubiquitous presence in medical facilities from large academic to small regional hospitals and their round the clock accessibility due to their ease of use for both staff and patients as compared to MR scanners. The legitimate concern of radiation dose has sparked discussions on the risk vs benefit of CT scanning. It is recognized that newer CT applications, like CCTA and perfusion, will be severely curtailed unless radiation dose is reduced. This paper discusses the various hardware and software techniques developed to reduce radiation dose to patients in CT scanning. The current average effective dose of a CT study is ∼10 mSv, with the implementation of dose reduction techniques discussed herein; it is realistic to expect that the average effective dose may be decreased by 2-3 fold. © 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

N2  - In this paper, a novel nonlinear joint dynamical model is presented, which is based on a set of coupled ordinary differential equations of motion and a Gaussian mixture model representation of pulsatile cardiovascular (CV) signals. In the proposed framework, the joint interdependences of CV signals are incorporated by assuming a unique angular frequency that controls the limit cycle of the heart rate. Moreover, the time consequence of CV signals is controlled by the same phase parameter that results in the space dimensionality reduction. These joint equations together with linear assignments to observation are further used in the Kalman filter structure for estimation and tracking. Moreover, we propose a measure of signal fidelity by monitoring the covariance matrix of the innovation signals throughout the filtering procedure. Five categories of life-threatening arrhythmias were verified by simultaneously tracking the signal fidelity and the polar representation of the CV signal estimations. We analyzed data from Physiobank multiparameter databases (MIMIC I and II). Performance evaluation results demonstrated that the sensitivity of the detection ranges over 93.50 and 100.00. In particular, the addition of more CV signals improved the positive predictivity of the proposed method to 99.27 for the total arrhythmic types. The method was also used for false arrhythmia suppression issued by ICU monitors, with an overall false suppression rate reduced from 42.3 to 9.9. In addition, false critical ECG arrhythmia alarm rates were found to be, on average, 42.3, with individual rates varying between 16.7 and 86.5. The results illustrate that the method can contribute to, and enhance the performance of clinical life-threatening arrhythmia detection. © 2011 IEEE.

N2  - Data acquisition and analysis of various cardiac/transducer signals based on virtual instrument technology is gaining importance .This paper introduces a novel way of automating the diagnosis of cardiac disorders using an expert system developed on the basis of information derived from the analysis of Electrocardiogram (ECG) and also provides the online monitoring of cardiac patient. Cardiologists use ECG as a definitive indicator of the condition of the human heart using certain well-defined rules and their own experience to diagnose the condition of patient. The decision process is made systematic by developing a visualization tool using proven algorithm for processing the information contained in the typical ECG. The information can be of great help to a general practitioner, to identify the specific problem and start treatment without any delay. The proposed system provides a fast and effective diagnosis of the problem. This has been possible by encoding the expert knowledge and interfacing it with real time ECG available. The system has fast updating facility to track any rapid deterioration, if it occurs and is thus helpful to monitor patients in ICU. ©2010 IEEE.

N2  - You are a nurse working in an intensive care unit (ICU), and your patient, a 62-year-old man, has just arrived from the operating room after a cholecystectomy. He is sleepy but arousable and says he has some incisional pain. You start cardiac monitoring with lead II, as is the practice in your area. One hour later, the patient has ventricular fibrillation. After successful defibrillation, 12-lead electrocardiography (ECG) is done. The patient has ST-segment depression in lead III and 4 mm of ST-segment elevation in leads V3 and V4. You note that the patient's history includes placement of a stent to the left anterior descending coronary artery 3 months before the cholecystectomy and that he had stopped taking clopidogrel 2 weeks before the current surgery. Knowing this information, would you have chosen a different way to monitor this patient? How would you decide what leads to monitor? Is it possible that the ECG changes would have been visible before the arrest, allowing intervention that might have prevented the arrest?. © 2010 American Association of Critical-Care Nurses.

N2  - Critical Arrhythmic ECG such as Ventricular Tachycardia (VT) and Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) are both distinguishable by its waveform characteristics. A VF waveform is often described as disorganized and has an irregular rhythm while a VT waveform exhibits abnormal signatures and presents a regular rhythm pattern. This paper presents a fast cross-correlation algorithm using multiple waveform templates for automatic detection of life threatening arrhythmias such as VT and VF from the Normal Sinus Rhythm (NSR) waveforms. A sliding-window template cross-correlation technique is applied to an ECG signal to generate an array of correlation coefficients. Then a correlation coefficient curve is used to detect high coefficient values for a type of template that will quantify the similarity between an examined ECG signal and a template. The method presented in this paper is able to detect all three different types of ECG signals from a total 21 testing signal set with a satisfied correct rate. © 2010 IEEE.

N2  - Monitoring cardiac output (CO) is important for the management of patient circulation in an operation room (OR) or intensive care unit (ICU). We assumed that the change in pulse wave transit time (PWTT) obtained from an electrocardiogram (ECG) and a pulse oximeter wave is correlated with the change in stroke volume (SV), from which CO is derived. The present study reports the verification of this hypothesis using a hemodynamic analysis theory and animal study. PWTT consists of a pre-ejection period (PEP), the pulse transit time through an elasticity artery (T1), and the pulse transit time through peripheral resistance arteries (T2). We assumed a consistent negative correlation between PWTT and SV under all conditions of varying circulatory dynamics. The equation for calculating SV from PWTT was derived based on the following procedures. 1. Approximating SV using a linear equation of PWTT. 2. The slope and y-intercept of the above equation were determined under consideration of vessel compliance (SV was divided by Pulse Pressure (PP)), animal type, and the inherent relationship between PP and PWTT. Animal study was performed to verify the above-mentioned assumption. The correlation coefficient of PWTT and SV became r = - 0.710 (p < 0.001), and a good correlation was admitted. It has been confirmed that accurate continuous CO and SV measurement is only possible by monitoring regular clinical parameters (ECG, SpO2, and NIBP). © 2010 IEEE.

N2  - During anesthesia practise the mean goal is effective tissue oxygenation for this reason we use different parameters. In traditional usage we evaluate ECG, non-invasive blood pressure measurements and SpO 2 parameters. In advanced monitorisation arterial, central venous and pulmonary artery pressure, ventilator parameters and blood gas analyses are used. We use the same monitorisation in adult cardiac surgey. During extracorporal circulation (ECC) the flow is non-pulsatile which causes release of mediators that damage microcirculation, acute and deep hemodilution. Based on these phenomena and the patient's underlying disease, balance between bleeding and coagulation is impaired increasing incidence of stroke and cerebral hypoperfusion However according to all risks that we mentioned above, in cardiac surgery with ECC, generally cerebral tissue perfusion monitorisation is never used which is a weak-point . traditional advanced monitorisation. So physicians perform many manipulations to reduce risks, such as increasing mean arterial pressure and cardiac output. These manipulations also bring some other risks. As a result cerebral tissue function monitorisation is very important during ECC, and near- infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) method which is improved for advanced cerebral function monitorisation can be used. NIRS method can be used for cardiac surgery, geriatric non cardiac surgery patients, and also the patients who have diabetes, congestive heart failure and other comorbidi-ties. NIRS monitorisation decreases post-operative cognitive function disorders, ICU and hospital stay and also operative costs.

N2  - The QT interval is regarded as an important biomarker for the assessment of arrhythmia liability, and evidence of QT prolongation has led to the withdrawal and relabeling of numerous compounds. Traditional methods of assessing QT prolongation correct the QT interval for the length of the RR interval (which varies inversely with heart-rate) in a variety of ways. These methods often disagree with each other and do not take into account changes in autonomic state. Correcting the QT interval for RR reduces a bivariate observation (RR, QT) to a univariate observation (QTc). The development of automatic electrocardiogram (ECG) signal acquisition systems has made it possible to collect continuous (so called 'beat-to-beat') ECG data. ECG data collected prior to administration of a compound allow us to define a region for (RR, QT) values that encompasses typical activity. Such reference regions are used in clinical applications to define the 'normal' region of clinical or laboratory measurements. This paper motivates the need for reference regions of (RR, QT) values from beat-to-beat ECG data, and describes a way of constructing these. We introduce a measure of agreement between two reference regions that points to the reliability of 12-lead digital Holter data. We discuss the use of reference regions in establishing baselines for ECG parameters to assist in the evaluation of cardiac risk and illustrate using data from two methodological studies.

N2  - Our research concerns the problem of data queuing in telemedical non-uniformly reporting surveillance systems, recently introduced to cardiology. Automatic scheduling of reports was achieved with taking into consideration of two auxiliary data attributes in the information structure: the validity period and the priority, set individually for each ECG diagnostic measurement. The patient-side recorder-interpreter works in one of two reportingmodes: in the delayed mode the transmission is deferred until packets are filled with valid data, while in the immediate mode diagnostic packets are transmitted as promptly as implied by sampling requirements. In the delayed reporting mode, the packet size lasts for 6 minutes of recording, while the wireless transfer session is completed within 10 seconds, allowing for reduction of 94% of required power. In the immediate reporting mode, the packet is collected within 4.63 seconds, which is still acceptable as real time monitoring.

N2  - The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a diagnostic tool that measures and records the electrical activity of the heart in exquisite detail. Interpretation of these details allows diagnosis of a wide range of heart conditions. Automatic extraction of time plane features is important for cardiac disease diagnosis. This paper presents a multi-resolution wavelet transform based system for detection and evaluation of QRS complex. In first step of this paper we use the selective confident method to find the QRS complex, at next step we use a threshold method to find the QRS complex and finally we apply the composition of first step algorithm and thresholding method which shows robust ability of finding QRS compared to other methods. Achieved overall accuracy of QRS detection for only d4 scale without threshold is 84.48%, the composition of d3, d4, d5 without threshold 93.23%, only d4 with threshold 90%, and d3, d4, d5 with threshold 98.2%. © 2011 CCAL.

N2  - Background: Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) is increasingly utilized for patients with acute respiratory failure (ARF). The shortage of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) beds, a growing confidence with the technique, and the opportunity to treat ARF in a more responsive phase lead to the application of NIV outside of the ICU. The Study Group on Emergency of the Italian Society of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) promoted a national survey to collect data on NIV use outside of the ICU. Methods: An anonymous questionnaire was developed, focusing on the location and modalities of NIV treatments, organizational and technical aspects, monitoring, estimated outcomes, the presence of protocols, and complications. The questionnaire was mailed to all members of the Scientific Society. Results: Forty-six respondents were from 46 hospitals. Thirty-seven (80%) respondents applied NIV in the Emergency Department and/or General Wards. In the majority of hospitals (72%), training preceded NIV introduction. NIV could be applied in all ordinary wards in 28% of the hospitals. Patients remained in their ward in 89% of the hospitals, and a protocol was present in 70% of the hospitals. Monitoring was usually limited to continuous pulseoxymetry and EKG; 18% of respondents did not have a monitoring standard. Reported complications and practical problems were potentially severe. Few hospitals (15%) collected data on NIV treatments. The efficacy of NIV was perceived as low, as 73% of respondents estimated that NIV avoided tracheal intubation in less than half of the treated patients. Conclusion: In Italy, NIV is extensively applied in non-intensive wards, and its use is not free from criticalities and contradictions. Further prospective studies and possibly guidelines are needed. © Minerva Medica.

N2  - Background: The aim of this study was to determine the frequency and nature of errors made by computer ECG analysis of AF and its clinical consequences. Methods: A total of 10,279 ECGs were collected. They were automatically interpreted by the built-in ECG software, and then reread by two cardiologists. AF-related ECGs included the three groups; overdiagnosed AF (other rhythms except AF diagnosed as AF), misdiagnosed AF (AF diagnosed as other rhythms except AF), and true AF (AF diagnosed as AF by both computer ECG interpretation and cardiologist). Results: There were 1,057 AF-related ECGs from 409 patients and among these, 840 ECGs (79.5%) were true AF. Overdiagnosis occurred in 98 (9.3%) cases. Sinus rhythm and sinus tachycardia with premature atrial contraction and/or baseline artifact and sinus arrhythmia were commonly overdiagnosed as AF. Misdiagnosis occurred in 119 (11.3%) cases where AF was usually misdiagnosed as sinus or supraventricular tachycardia. Among erroneous computer ECG interpretations, 17 cases (7.8%) were not corrected by the ordering physicians and inappropriate managements of patients were conducted. Conclusions: Erroneous computer ECG interpretation of AF was not rare. Attention should be concentrated on educating physicians about the ECG appearance and confounding factors of AF along with ongoing quality control of built-in software for automatic ECG interpretation. © 2011, Japanese Heart Rhythm Society.

N2  - Coronary artery disease is one of its most important causes of early mortality in western world. Therefore, clinicians seek to improve diagnostic procedures in order to reach reliable early diagnoses. In the clinical setting, coronary artery disease diagnostics is often performed in a sequential manner, where the four diagnostic steps typically consist of evaluation of (1) signs and symptoms of the disease and electrocardiogram (ECG) at rest, (2) sequential ECG testing during the controlled exercise, (3) myocardial perfusion scintigraphy, and (4) finally coronary angiography, that is considered as the "gold standard" reference method. Our study focuses on improving diagnostic and probabilistic interpretation of scintigraphic images obtained from the penultimate step. We use automatic image parameterization on multiple resolutions, based on spatial association rules. Extracted image parameters are combined into more informative composite parameters by means of principle component analysis, and finally used to build automatic classifiers with neural networks and naive Bayes learning methods. Experiments show that our approach significantly increases diagnostic accuracy, specificity and sensitivity with respect to clinical results. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

N2  - High level of false positive alarms is one of the main issues in ambulatory monitoring in Intensive Care Units. The solution to it is the development of new methods that will be both reliable in detection of anomalies in the patient's state and robust to noise and artifacts. The current study is focused on the development of unsupervised automated approach to analysis of periodic biosignals. The proposed classification method for distinguishing anomalies from normal patterns is based on the combination of time series domain pattern recognition method Singular Spectrum Analysis and clustering techniques. The model itself includes preprocessing, analysis, classification and validation stages and one of its main benefits consists in automated approach to regular features (e.g., heartbeats) extraction without the need of analysing its morphologies, and further unsupervised classification of the obtained patterns. Still, this method has its limitations, as all unsupervised learning-based techniques, and the validation stage requires additional work. The results of testing on the series of biomedical signals (ECG, O2, arterial pressure) from Physionet Database showed that this method is effective in anomalies detection tasks, highly independent of the periodic signal specificity and resistant to the average level of noise. © 2011 Univ of Sarajevo.

N2  - © Marc Van de Velde, Helen Scholefield and Lauren A. Plante. Introduction, One of the most important functions of any intensive care unit (ICU) is to enable patients to arrive at specific, goal-directed endpoints of care. The exact nature of this care plan is individualized based on the character of the patient, the disease process, the unit, and the ICU team; to ensure that care is proceeding along the desired trajectory requires objective data. These data are most often provided by monitors – devices that measure specific physiological variables. Collection of data over time allows for minute-to-minute assessment of trends in a patient’s physiological state. Intensivists, physicians specially trained in critical care medicine, and other members of the ICU care team may have in-depth knowledge of monitors not available to the practitioner, who does not use them on a daily basis. It is important that these non-intensivists understand the utility, indications/contraindications, and basic interpretation of the information provided by the monitors currently in use. Non-invasive monitors do not require significant intrusion into a patient’s body. The most commonly encountered non-invasive monitors are electrocardiography (ECG), pulse oximetry, blood pressure measurement by manometry, urine output, pulse oximetry and end-tidal carbon dioxide monitoring. Invasive monitors are those which require encroachment on a patient’s body such as cannulation of vessels, insertion of neurological monitors, or insertion of pressure monitors.

N2  - Personal health monitoring refers to the long-term health monitoring that is performed in uncontrolled environments instead of a laboratory, for example, at home or by using wearable sensors. The monitoring is done by individuals alone, usually without guidance from health care professionals. Data produced by personal health monitoring (for example, actigraphy, heart rate, etc.) are currently used more in personal wellness monitoring rather than in clinical decisionmaking, because of challenges in the interpretation of the long-term and possibly unreliable data. Automatic analysis of long-term personal health monitoring data could be used for the continuous recognition of changes in individual's behavior and health status, and to point out which everyday selections have a negative effect on health and which have a positive effect. This can not be achieved by using sparse measurements in controlled environments.In this thesis, data analysis was carried out for the recognition of physical and mental load using data from wearable sensors and other self-measurements. Large, annotated data libraries were collected in real-life or realistic laboratory conditions for the purpose of the development of practical algorithms and the identification of the most information-rich sensors and signal interpretation methods. Time and frequency domain features were computed from raw sensor data for the correlation analysis and the automatic classification of the personal health monitoring data. The decision tree, artificial neural network, K-Nearest Neighbor and a hybrid of a decision tree and artificial neural network classifiers were used. Automatic activity recognition aims at recognizing individual's activities and postures using data from unobtrusive, wearable sensors. Similarly, the unobtrusive, wearable sensors can be used for the assessment of energy expenditure.The quantities measured in this thesis include acceleration, compass bearings, angular rate, ECG, heart rate, respiratory effort, illumination, temperature, humidity, GPS location, pulse plethysmogram, skin conductance and air pressure. The results indicate that several everyday activities, especially those with regular movements, can be recognized with good accuracy. The energy expenditure estimate obtained using movement sensors was found accurate in activities involving regular movements. The sensors that react to the change of activity type without delay were found the most useful for activity recognition. These include accelerometers, magnetometers, angular rate sensors and GPS location sensors. Automatic assessment of mental load aims at measuring the level of mental load during everyday activities using data from wearable sensors. The assessment of long-term stress aims at finding measures that reflect the perceived stress level, either directly or as observed through changes in behavior. Data were collected with people suffering from long-term work-related stress and participating in a rehabilitation program. Automatic measurements of recovery, measured with a bed sensor, actigraphy and bedroom illumination sensors were found to correlate best with the self-assessed stress level.Careful selection of sensor types, sensor locations and input features played a more critical role in successful classification than the selection of a classifier. Computational complexity of the classifier's classification phase has an impact on the power consumption of a hosting mobile terminal. Power consumption is one of the bottlenecks in long-term personal health monitoring solutions today. © VTT 2011.

N2  - A simple and effective method of displaying blood pressure measurement from photoplethysmography has been developed. The method is developed to be incorporated as noninvasive monitoring of blood pressure from a patient in a intensive care unit. This implementation includes finger tip pulseoximetry probe, differential amplifier, data acquisition card, software filtering, amplification and blood pressure measurement from pulse transit time calculation continuously by microcomputer correlation of pulse transit time to blood pressure. It is expected that the method will be incorporated to a low cost portable personal computer based ICU monitoring system that will also display temperature, pulse rate and ECG of the patient continuously in future. © 2011 IEEE.

N2  - Objectives: The present study was conducted to evaluate the cardioprotective effect of sevoflurane compared with propofol in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) undergoing peripheral vascular surgery; and to address the question whether a volatile anesthetic might improve cardiac outcome in these patients. Methods: One hundred twenty-six patients scheduled for elective peripheral vascular surgery were prospectively randomized to receive either sevoflurane inhalation anesthesia or total intravenous anesthesia. ST-segment monitoring was performed continuously during intra- and post-operative 48 h periods. The number of ischemic events and the cumulative duration of ischemia in each patient were recorded. Blood was sampled in all patients for the determination of cTnI. Samples were obtained before the induction of anesthesia, on admission to the ICU, and at 6, 12, 24, and 48 h after admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). Patients were followed-up during their hospital stay for any adverse cardiac events. Results: The incidence of ischemia were comparable among the groups [16 (25%) patients in sevoflurane group vs 24 (39%) patients in propofol group; P=0.126]. Duration, cumulative duration, and magnitude of ST-segment depression of ischemic events in each patient were significantly less in sevoflurane group (P=0.008, 0.048, 0.038, respectively). cTnI levels of the overall population were significantly less in sevoflurane group vs propofol group (P values <0.0001) from 6 h postoperative and onward. Meanwhile, cTnI levels at 6, 12, 24, and 48 h after admission to the ICU in patients who presented with ischemic electrocardiographic (ECG) changes were significantly lower in sevoflurane group than in the propofol group (P<0.0001, <0.0001, <0.0001, 0.0003). None of the patients presented with unstable angina, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, or serious arrhythmia either during ICU or hospital stay. Conclusion: Patients with CAD receiving sevoflurane for peripheral vascular surgery had significantly lower release of cardiac troponin I at 6 h postoperatively and lasting for 48 h than patients receiving propofol for the same procedure with significant decrease in duration, cumulative duration of ischemic events, and degree of ST depression in each patient.

N2  - Pulse oximetry (PO) is extensively used in intensive care unit (ICU); this is mainly due to the fact that it is a non-invasive and real-time monitoring method. PO allows to measure arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) and in particular hemoglobin oxygenation. Optical PO is typically realized by the use of a clip (to be applied on the ear or on the finger top) containing a couple of monochromatic LED sources and a photodiode. The main drawback with the use of PO is the presence of movement artifacts or disturbance due to optical sources and skin, causing erroneous saturation data. The aim of this work is to present the measurement procedure based on a specially developed algorithm able to reject erroneous oxygen saturation data during long lasting monitoring of patients in ICU and to compare measurement data with reference data provided by EGA. We have collected SaO2 data from a standard PO and used an intensive care unit monitor to collect data. This device was connected to our acquisition system and heart rate (HR) and SaO2 data were acquired and processed by our specially developed algorithm and directly reproduced on the PC screen for use by the clinicians. The algorithm here used for the individuation and rejection of erroneous saturation data is based on the assessment of the difference between the Heart Rate (HR) measured by respectively by the ECG and PO. We have used an emogasanalyzer (EGA) for comparison of the measured data. The study was carried out in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), using 817 data coming from 24 patients and the observation time was of about 10000 hours. Results show a reduction in the maximum difference between the SaO2 data measured, simultaneously, on the same patient by the EGA and by the proposed method of 14.20% and of the 4.76% in average over the 817 samples. The measurement method proposed is therefore able to individuate and eliminate the erroneous saturation data due to motion artifacts and reported by the pulse oxymeter. Specifically in neonatal ICU, it allows to come to more efficient individuation of apnea, hypoxia and hyperoxia events and consequently to operate more adequate and efficient therapeutic actions. © 2011 American Institute of Physics.

N2  - During a retroperitoneoscopic adrenalectomy in the prone position, a sudden increase in end-Tidal CO 2 (EtCO 2) (from 42 to 68 mmHg) followed by an abrupt decrease (from 68 to 35 mmHg) was observed, concomitantly with a right adrenal vein laceration. Heart rate decreased to 30 bpm, and the systolic blood pressure decreased to 40 mmHg. The patient was slightly turned in the left lateral and Trendelenburg position and vasoactive drugs were administered. The systemic blood pressure, EtCO 2, CO 2 elimination (VCO 2) and pulse oximetry (SpO 2) progressively improved within 10 minutes and, at the end of the surgery, the blood pressure recovered from hypotension. ECG returned to normal, with sinusal rhythm and heart rate ∼70 bpm. The patient was extubated and moved to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). This case suggests that gas embolisms may occur during retroperitoneoscopic adrenalectomy, and acute changes in EtCO 2 should alert the clinicians to these rare but potentially lethal complication. EtCO 2 monitoring is essential during laparoscopy, as it may help an early detection of CO 2 embolism, characterized by a transient and rapid increase in EtCO 2, followed by an abrupt decrease.

N2  - Objectives: Our experience with the use of Warden's procedure for the repair of sinus venosus ASD with anomalous right upper pulmonary venous connection. Method: Fifty-eight patients had Warden's procedure from September 2008 to May 2011. The demographic data, preoperative and postoperative ECG, aortic cross-clamp time, cardiopulmonary bypass time, Holter monitoring, complications length of ICU and hospital stay were analysed. Result: The male to female ratio was 1:1. The median age was 10.9 years (range 2-48 years). Preoperatively all patients were in sinus rhythm. Twenty-six patients had associated left superior vena cava and two patients had also Tuckers procedure at the same time. The mean follow up was 1.2 years (range 1 months-2.8 years). Postoperative Holter monitoring showed sinus rhythm in all the patients. The mean CPB time was 83.6. min (range 54-163. min), mean aortic cross-clamp time was 48.0. min (range 22-112. min), mean ICU stay was 1.26 days (range 1-4 days) and length of hospital was 8.3 days (range 5-13 days) Postoperative echocardiography showed less than 1. mmHg gradient across the SVC-RA appendage anastomotic site in all the patients. No mortality was recorded. Conclusion: This is the largest reported series of Warden's procedure in the literature till date. It is known from other studies that sinus node dysfunction and conversion to junctional nodal rhythm were quite a concern with the conventional techniques and Warden's procedure specifically avoids these problems. © 2011 Australasian Society of Cardiac and Thoracic Surgeons and the Cardiac Society of Australia and New Zealand.

N2  - Computerized interpretation of the electrocardiogram (CIE) was introduced to improve  the correct interpretation of the electrocardiogram (ECG), facilitating health care decision making and reducing costs. Worldwide, millions of ECGs are recorded annually, with the majority automatically analyzed, followed by an immediate interpretation. Limitations in the diagnostic accuracy of CIE were soon recognized and still persist, despite ongoing improvement in ECG algorithms. Unfortunately, inexperienced physicians ordering the ECG may fail to recognize interpretation mistakes and accept the automated diagnosis without criticism. Clinical mismanagement may result, with the risk of exposing patients to useless investigations or potentially dangerous treatment. Consequently, CIE over-reading and confirmation by an experienced ECG reader are essential and are repeatedly recommended in published reports. Implementation of new ECG knowledge is also important. The current status of automated ECG interpretation is reviewed, with suggestions for improvement.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Telehealth care is a global trend affecting clinical practice around the  world. To mitigate the workload of health professionals and provide ubiquitous health care, a comprehensive surveillance system with value-added services based on information technologies must be established. OBJECTIVE: We conducted this study to describe our proposed telesurveillance system designed for monitoring and classifying electrocardiogram (ECG) signals and to evaluate the performance of ECG classification. METHODS: We established a telesurveillance system with an automatic ECG interpretation mechanism. The system included: (1) automatic ECG signal transmission via telecommunication, (2) ECG signal processing, including noise elimination, peak estimation, and feature extraction, (3) automatic ECG interpretation based on the support vector machine (SVM) classifier and rule-based processing, and (4) display of ECG signals and their analyzed results. We analyzed 213,420 ECG signals that were diagnosed by cardiologists as the gold standard to verify the classification performance. RESULTS: In the clinical ECG database from the Telehealth Center of the National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH), the experimental results showed that the ECG classifier yielded a specificity value of 96.66% for normal rhythm detection, a sensitivity value of 98.50% for disease recognition, and an accuracy value of 81.17% for noise detection. For the detection performance of specific diseases, the recognition model mainly generated sensitivity values of 92.70% for atrial fibrillation, 89.10% for pacemaker rhythm, 88.60% for atrial premature contraction, 72.98% for T-wave inversion, 62.21% for atrial flutter, and 62.57% for first-degree atrioventricular block. CONCLUSIONS: Through connected telehealth care devices, the telesurveillance system, and the automatic ECG interpretation system, this mechanism was intentionally designed for continuous decision-making support and is reliable enough to reduce the need for face-to-face diagnosis. With this value-added service, the system could widely assist physicians and other health professionals with decision making in clinical practice. The system will be very helpful for the patient who suffers from cardiac disease, but for whom it is inconvenient to go to the hospital very often.

N2  - The conduction system includes a primary pacemaker, the internodal tracts, the  atrioventricular node, and the His bundle with the right and left branches. In "emergency" conditions, accessory pacemakers may be triggered. The conduction system produces very low-intensity currents; a surface electrocardiogram (ECG) detects only the big myocardial masses. Electrogenetic mechanisms are reduced automaticity and/or impaired conduction at the base of bradycardias. An increased automaticity and/or reentry phenomenon are at the base of ectopic beats and tachycardias. A "wide QRS" is a ventricular activation time of 120 milliseconds or more. The "laddergram" helps in the fast and reliable ECG interpretation.

N2  - About 50 years ago, Norman Jefferis Holter invented a device that opened the  possibility of recording heart activity over long periods of time. This invention, together with the rapid developments in electronics, has enabled a revolutionary change in the diagnosis and management of cardiac diseases. Ambulatory cardiac monitors have decreased in size to the point of becoming wearable or implantable and are able to monitor heart activity for months or even years. In addition, new telecommunication systems allow clinicians to remotely access cardiac events and to respond within a short period of time. Novel advances in computing and algorithm development are expanding the clinical applications of ambulatory devices with more complex automatic interpretation of the electrocardiographic signal. This article reviews the state of the art of these techniques from both clinical and technical approaches, covering a historic perspective up to today, and discusses current applications, challenges, and future directions.

N2  - In vitro surrogate models of human cardiac tissue hold great promise in disease  modeling, cardiotoxicity testing, and future applications in regenerative medicine. However, the generation of engineered human cardiac constructs with tissue-like functionality is currently thwarted by difficulties in achieving efficient maturation at the cellular and/or tissular level. Here, we report on the design and implementation of a platform for the production of engineered cardiac macrotissues from human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs), which we term "CardioSlice." PSC-derived cardiomyocytes, together with human fibroblasts, are seeded into large 3D porous scaffolds and cultured using a parallelized perfusion bioreactor with custom-made culture chambers. Continuous electrical stimulation for 2 weeks promotes cardiomyocyte alignment and synchronization, and the emergence of cardiac tissue-like properties. These include electrocardiogram-like signals that can be readily measured on the surface of CardioSlice constructs, and a response to proarrhythmic drugs that is predictive of their effect in human patients.

N2  - Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the most common cause of heart disease globally.  This is because there is no symptom exhibited in its initial phase until the disease progresses to an advanced stage. The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a widely accessible diagnostic tool to diagnose CAD that captures abnormal activity of the heart. However, it lacks diagnostic sensitivity. One reason is that, it is very challenging to visually interpret the ECG signal due to its very low amplitude. Hence, identification of abnormal ECG morphology by clinicians may be prone to error. Thus, it is essential to develop a software which can provide an automated and objective interpretation of the ECG signal. This paper proposes the implementation of long short-term memory (LSTM) network with convolutional neural network (CNN) to automatically diagnose CAD ECG signals accurately. Our proposed deep learning model is able to detect CAD ECG signals with a diagnostic accuracy of 99.85% with blindfold strategy. The developed prototype model is ready to be tested with an appropriate huge database before the clinical usage.

METHODS: For each patient, the resting ECG-gated SPECT MPI short-axis images were sampled in 3D to generate a polar map of the perfusion distribution used to determine LV myocardial viability, and to measure LV synchronicity using our phase analysis tool. In the visual integration method, two experts visually interpreted the LV viability and mechanical dyssynchrony from the short-axis images and polar maps of viability and phase, to determine the latest contracting viable segments using the 17-segment model. In the automatic method, the apical segments, septal segments, and segments with more than 50% scar were excluded as these are not candidates for CRT LV probe placement. Amongst the remaining viable segments, the segments, whose phase angles were within 10° of the latest phase angle (the most delayed contracting segment), were identified for potential CRT LV probe placement and ranked based on the phase angles of the segments. Both methods were tested in 36 pre-CRT patients who underwent ECG-gated SPECT MPI. The accuracy was determined as the percent agreement between the visual integration and automatic methods. The automatic method was performed by a second independent operator to evaluate the inter-operator processing reproducibility. RESULTS: In all the 36 patients, the LV lead positions of the 1st choices recommended by the automatic and visual integration methods were in the same segments in 35 patients, which achieved an agreement rate of 97.2%. In the inter-operator reproducibility test, the LV lead positions of the 1st choices recommended by the two operators were in the same segments in 25 patients, and were in the adjacent segments in 7 patients, which achieved an overall agreement of 88.8%. CONCLUSIONS: An automatic method has been developed to detect the latest contracting viable LV segments to help guide the LV probe placement used in CRT therapy. The retrospective clinical study with 36 patients suggests that this method has high agreement against the visual integration method by experts and good inter-operator reproducibility. Consequently, this method is promising to be a clinical tool to recommend the CRT LV lead positions.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Considering the rates of sudden cardiac death (SCD) and pump failure  death (PFD) in chronic heart failure (CHF) patients and the cost-effectiveness of their preventing treatments, identification of CHF patients at risk is an important challenge. In this work, we studied the prognostic performance of the combination of an index potentially related to dispersion of repolarization restitution (Δα), an index quantifying T-wave alternans (IAA) and the slope of heart rate turbulence (TS) for classification of SCD and PFD. METHODS: Holter ECG recordings of 597 CHF patients with sinus rhythm enrolled in the MUSIC study were analyzed and Δα, IAA and TS were obtained. A strategy was implemented using support vector machines (SVM) to classify patients in three groups: SCD victims, PFD victims and other patients (the latter including survivors and victims of non-cardiac causes). Cross-validation was used to evaluate the performance of the implemented classifier. RESULTS: Δα and IAA, dichotomized at 0.035 (dimensionless) and 3.73 μV, respectively, were the ECG markers most strongly associated with SCD, while TS, dichotomized at 2.5 ms/RR, was the index most strongly related to PFD. When separating SCD victims from the rest of patients, the individual marker with best performance was Δα≥0.035, which, for a fixed specificity (Sp) of 90%, showed a sensitivity (Se) value of 10%, while the combination of Δα and IAA increased Se to 18%. For separation of PFD victims from the rest of patients, the best individual marker was TS ≤ 2.5 ms/RR, which, for Sp=90%, showed a Se of 26%, this value being lower than Se=34%, produced by the combination of Δα and TS. Furthermore, when performing SVM classification into the three reported groups, the optimal combination of risk markers led to a maximum Sp of 79% (Se=18%) for SCD and Sp of 81% (Se=14%) for PFD. CONCLUSIONS: The results shown in this work suggest that it is possible to efficiently discriminate SCD and PFD in a population of CHF patients using ECG-derived risk markers like Δα, TS and IAA.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Atrial tachycardia (AT) still poses a major challenge in catheter  ablation. Although state-of-the-art electroanatomical mapping systems allow to acquire several thousand intracardiac electrograms (EGMs), algorithms for diagnostic analysis are mainly limited to the amplitude of the signal (voltage map) and the local activation time (LAT map). We applied spatio-temporal analysis of EGM activity to generate maps indicating reentries and diastolic potentials, thus identifying and localizing the driving mechanism of AT. METHODS: First, the time course of active surface area ASA is determined during one basic cycle length (BCL). The chamber cycle length coverage cCLC reflects the relative duration within one BCL for which activity was present in each individual atrium. A local cycle length coverage lCLC is computed for circular subareas with 20 mm diameter. The simultaneous active surface area sASA is determined to indicate the spatial extent of depolarizing tissue. RESULTS: Combined analysis of these spatial scales allowed to correctly identify and localize the driving mechanism: cCLC values of 100% were indicative for atria harbouring a reentrant driver. lCLC could detect micro reentries within an area of 1.65 $\pm$ 1.28 cm $^2$ in simulated data and differentiate them against focal sources. Middiastolic potentials, being potential targets for catheter ablation, were identified as areas showing confined activity based on sASA values. CONCLUSION: The concept of spatio-temporal activity analysis proved successful and correctly indicated the tachycardia mechanism in 20 simulated AT scenarios and three clinical data sets. SIGNIFICANCE: Automatic interpretation of intracardiac mapping data could help to improve the treatment strategy in complex cases of AT.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Atrial fibrillation is a common type of heart rhythm abnormality caused  by a problem with the heart's electrical system. Early detection of this disease has important implications for stroke prevention and management. Our objective is to construct an intelligent tool that assists cardiologists in identifying automatically cardiac arrhythmias and noise in electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings. APPROACH: Our base deep classifier combined a convolutional neural network (CNNs) and a sequence of long short-term memory units, with pooling, dropout and normalization techniques to improve their accuracy. The network predicted a classification at every 18th input sample and the final prediction was selected for classification. Ten standalone models that used our base classifier architecture were first cross-validated separately on 90% of the PhysioNet/CinC Challenge 2017 dataset and then tested on 10%. An ensemble classifier selected the label of the best average probability from the ten sub-models to improve prediction quality. MAIN RESULTS: Our original result submitted to the challenge gave a mean F(1)-measure of 80%. The new proposed method improved the test score to 82%, which was tied for the third-highest score in the follow-up phase of the challenge. SIGNIFICANCE: Without employing a time-consuming feature engineering step, the ensemble classifier trained with this architecture provided a robust solution to the problem of detecting cardiac arrhythmia from noisy ECG signals. In addition, interpretation of the classifier by inspection of its network parameters and predictions revealed what aspects of the ECG signal the classifier considered most discriminating.

N2  - Large volumes of physiological data can now be routinely collected using wearable  devices, though a key challenge that remains is the conversion of raw data into clinically relevant and actionable information. While power constraints prevent continuous wireless streaming of large amounts of raw data for offline processing, on-board microprocessors have become sufficiently powerful for data reduction to be performed in real time on the wearable device itself, so that only aggregate, clinically interpretable measures need to be transmitted wirelessly. Here, we use the curve-length transform to extract key beat-by-beat information from the raw ECG waveform, and to identify clinically relevant timing and amplitude information. Each beat is parameterized by 12 morphological features that serve as fiducial markers, sufficient to directly reconstruct a scaffold representation of the ECG waveform. At a nominal heart rate of 70 beats/min and a sampling rate of 250 Hz, typical for wearable monitors, this represents approximately an 18-fold compression. Using difference encoding, the compression ratio improves to 21. Our algorithm computes a running exponentially-weighted average of each identified morphological feature. When any feature deviates significantly from its running average, the algorithm retains the raw waveform for five beats preceding and following the anomaly, enabling future review of the raw data. The algorithm automatically located 93.8% of the 3,615 expert-annotated QRS onsets and offsets in the PhysioNet QT-Database to within 20 ms. Similarly, it located 83.5% of all 3,194 P-wave onset and offset annotations to within 32 ms, and 89.0% of all 3,542 T-wave offset annotations within 72 ms.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The accurate differentiation of wide complex tachycardias (WCTs) into  ventricular tachycardia (VT) or supraventricular wide complex tachycardia (SWCT) remains problematic despite numerous manually-operated electrocardiogram (ECG) interpretation methods. We sought to create a new WCT differentiation method that could be automatically implemented by computerized ECG interpretation (CEI) software. METHODS: In a two-part study, we developed and validated a logistic regression model (i.e. WCT Formula) that utilizes computerized measurements and computations derived from patients' paired WCT and subsequent baseline ECGs. In Part 1, a derivation cohort of paired WCT and baseline ECGs was examined to identify independent VT predictors to be incorporated into the WCT Formula. In Part 2, a separate validation cohort of paired WCT and baseline ECGs was used to prospectively evaluate the WCT Formula's diagnostic performance. RESULTS: The derivation cohort was comprised of 317 paired WCT (157 VT, 160 SWCT) and baseline ECGs. A logistic regression model (i.e. WCT Formula) incorporating WCT QRS duration (ms) (p < 0.001), frontal percent amplitude change (%) (p < 0.001), and horizontal percent amplitude change (%) (p < 0.001) yielded effective WCT differentiation (AUC of 0.96). The validation cohort consisted of 284 paired WCT (116 VT, 168 SWCT) and baseline ECGs. The WCT Formula achieved favorable accuracy (91.5%) with strong sensitivity (89.7%) and specificity (92.9%) for VT. CONCLUSION: The WCT Formula is an example of how contemporary CEI software could be used to successfully differentiate WCTs. The incorporation of similar automated methods into CEI software may improve clinicians' ability to accurately distinguish VT and SWCT.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Pauses in chest compressions (CCs) have a negative association with  survival from cardiac arrest. Electrocardiographic (ECG) rhythm analysis and defibrillator charging are significant contributors to CC pauses. OBJECTIVE: Accuracy of the Analysis During Compressions with Fast Reconfirmation (ADC-FR) algorithm, which features automated rhythm analysis and charging during CCs to reduce CC pauses, was retrospectively determined in a large database of ECGs from 2701 patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. METHODS: The ADC-FR algorithm generated a total of 7264 advisories, of which 3575 were randomly assigned to a development data set and 3689 to a test data set. With ADC-FR, a high-pass digital filter is used to remove CC artifacts, while the underlying ECG rhythm is automatically interpreted. When CCs are paused at the end of the 2-minute cardiopulmonary resuscitation interval, a 3-second reconfirmation analysis is performed using the artifact-free ECG to confirm the shock/no-shock advisory. The sensitivity and specificity of the ADC-FR algorithm in correctly identifying shockable/nonshockable rhythms during CCs were calculated. RESULTS: In both data sets, the accuracy of the ADC-FR algorithm for each ECG rhythm exceeded the recommended performance goals, which apply to a standard artifact-free ECG analysis. Sensitivity and specificity were 97% and 99%, respectively, for the development data set and 95% and 99% for the test data set. CONCLUSION: The ADC-FR algorithm is highly accurate in discriminating shockable and nonshockable rhythms and can be used to reduce CC pauses.

N2  - Electrocardiogram (ECG) acquisition is increasingly widespread in medical and  commercial devices, necessitating the development of automated interpretation strategies. Recently, deep neural networks have been used to automatically analyze ECG tracings and outperform physicians in detecting certain rhythm irregularities(1). However, deep learning classifiers are susceptible to adversarial examples, which are created from raw data to fool the classifier such that it assigns the example to the wrong class, but which are undetectable to the human eye(2,3). Adversarial examples have also been created for medical-related tasks(4,5). However, traditional attack methods to create adversarial examples do not extend directly to ECG signals, as such methods introduce square-wave artefacts that are not physiologically plausible. Here we develop a method to construct smoothed adversarial examples for ECG tracings that are invisible to human expert evaluation and show that a deep learning model for arrhythmia detection from single-lead ECG(6) is vulnerable to this type of attack. Moreover, we provide a general technique for collating and perturbing known adversarial examples to create multiple new ones. The susceptibility of deep learning ECG algorithms to adversarial misclassification implies that care should be taken when evaluating these models on ECGs that may have been altered, particularly when incentives for causing misclassification exist.

N2  - Machine learning approaches for human emotion recognition have recently demonstrated  high performance. However, only/mostly for subject-dependent approaches, in a variety of applications like advanced driver assisted systems, smart homes and medical environments. Therefore, now the focus is shifted more towards subject-independent approaches, which are more universal and where the emotion recognition system is trained using a specific group of subjects and then tested on totally new persons and thereby possibly while using other sensors of same physiological signals in order to recognize their emotions. In this paper, we explore a novel robust subject-independent human emotion recognition system, which consists of two major models. The first one is an automatic feature calibration model and the second one is a classification model based on Cellular Neural Networks (CNN). The proposed system produces state-of-the-art results with an accuracy rate between 80% and 89% when using the same elicitation materials and physiological sensors brands for both training and testing and an accuracy rate of 71.05% when the elicitation materials and physiological sensors brands used in training are different from those used in training. Here, the following physiological signals are involved: ECG (Electrocardiogram), EDA (Electrodermal activity) and ST (Skin-Temperature).

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Atrial Fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia,  presenting a significant independent risk factor for stroke and thromboembolism. With the emergence of m-Health devices, the importance of automatic detection of AF in an off-clinic setting is growing. This study demonstrates the performance of a bimodal classifier for distinguishing AF from sinus rhythm (SR) that could be used for automated detection of AF episodes. METHODS: Surface recordings from a hand-held research device and standard electrocardiograms (ECG) were collected and analyzed from 68 subjects. An additional 48 subjects from the MIT-BIH Arrythmia Database were also analyzed. All ECGs were blindly reviewed by physicians independently of the bimodal algorithm analysis. The algorithm selects an artifact-free 6-s ECG segment out of a 20-s long recording and computes a spectral Frequency Dispersion Metric (FDM) and a temporal R-R interval variability (VRR) index. RESULTS: Scatter plots of the VRR and FDM indices revealed two distinct clusters. The bimodal scattering of the indices revealed a linear classification boundary that could be employed to differentiate the SR from AF waveforms. The selected classification boundary was able to correctly differentiate all the subjects from both datasets into either SR or AF groups, except for 3 SR subjects from the MIT-BIH dataset. CONCLUSION: Our bimodal classification algorithm was demonstrated to successfully acquire, analyze and interpret ECGs for the presence of AF indicating its potential to support m-Health diagnosis, monitoring, and management of therapy in AF patients.

N2  - Atrial tachycardia is defined as a regular atrial activation from atrial areas with  centrifugal spread, caused by enhanced automaticity, triggered activity or microreentry. New ECG classification differentiates between focal and macroreentrant atrial tachycardia. Macroreentrant atrial tachycardias include typical atrial flutter and other well characterized macroreentrant circuits in right and left atrium. Typical atrial flutter has been described as counterclockwise reentry within right atrial and it presents a characteristic ECG "sawtooth" pattern on the inferior leads. The foci responsible for focal atrial tachycardia do not occur randomly throughout the atria but tend to cluster at characteristic anatomical locations. The surface ECG is a very helpful tool in directing mapping to particular areas of interest. Atrial tachycardia should be differentiated from other supraventricular tachycardias. We propose a diagnostic algorithm in order to help the physician to discriminate among those. Holter analysis could offer further details to differentiate between atrial tachycardia and another supraventricular tachycardia. However, if the diagnosis is uncertain, it is possible to utilize vagal maneuvers or adenosine administration. In conclusion, in spite of well-known limits, a good interpretation of ECG is very important and it could help the physician to manage and to treat correctly patients with atrial tachycardia.

N2  - BACKGROUND: ECG-gated SPECT myocardial perfusion imaging is usually acquired in  supine position. However, some patients are not comfortable in this position for a variety of personal or medical reasons. Our aim was to investigate the effect of patient positioning on quantitative SPECT imaging results using normal supine database. METHODS: 55 patients (mean age 58.5 ± 8.3 years) were enrolled in this prospective study. Each patient had a pair of ECG-gated stress SPECT myocardial perfusion images acquired on two gamma cameras: one in supine position and the other in upright sitting position. Left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF), end-diastolic (ED), and end-systolic (ES) left ventricular volumes (V), LV mass, summed stress perfusion defect score (SSS), and total severity score (TSS) were calculated automatically relative to a supine normal reference database. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in LVEF using the two cameras (0.65 ± 0.08 vs. 0.66 ± 0.10; P > 0.1). However, EDV, ESV, and LV mass were significantly smaller in sitting position than in supine position (89 vs. 80 ml; 33 vs. 29 ml and 115 vs. 109 ml, respectively, all P < 0.0001). On the other hand, SSS and TSS were significantly higher in sitting position than in supine position (5.16 vs. 8.73 and 166.82 vs. 288.27, both P < 0.0001). Overall, more studies in sitting position were interpreted as abnormal than in supine position (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Patient positioning has a significant impact on quantitative gated SPECT imaging results. Using a supine normal reference database, SSS and TSS were larger in sitting position than in supine position. Thus, for imaging in sitting position, separate normal limits are required.

No studies have assessed the reference standards for a Latin American population. Our aim was to establish the normal ranges of the ECG for pediatric and adult Brazilian primary care patients. METHODS: This retrospective observational study assessed all the consecutive 12-lead digital electrocardiograms of primary care patients at least 1 year old in Minas Gerais state, Brazil, recorded between 2010 and 2015. ECGs were excluded if there were technical problems, selected abnormalities were present or patients with selected self-declared comorbidities or on drug therapy. Only the first ECG from patients with multiple ECGs was accepted. The University of Glasgow ECG analysis program was used to automatically interpret the ECGs. For each variable, the 1st, 2nd, 50th, 98th and 99th percentiles were determined and results were compared to selected studies. RESULTS: A total of 1,493,905 ECGs were recorded. 1,007,891 were excluded and 486.014 were analyzed. This large study provided normal values for heart rate, P, QRS and T frontal axis, P and QRS overall duration, PR and QT overall intervals and QTc corrected by Hodges, Bazett, Fridericia and Framingham formulae. Overall, the results were similar to those from other studies performed in different populations but there were differences in extreme ages and specific measurements. CONCLUSIONS: This study has provided reference values for Latinos of both sexes older than 1 year. Our results are comparable to studies performed in different populations.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To date, no systematic work has been intended to describe spatio-temporal  patterns of cardiac rhythms using only short series of RR intervals, to facilitate visual or computerized-aided identification of EKG motifs for use in clinical practice. The aim of this study was to detect and classify eye-catching geometric patterns of Poincaré time-delay plots from different types of cardiac rhythms and arrhythmias using short-term EKG signals. METHODS: Approximately 150-300 representative, consecutive beats were retrieved from 24-h Holter registers of 100 patients with different heart rhythms. Two-dimensional Poincaré charts were created, and the resulting geometric patterns were transformed into representative familiar eye-catching drawings to interpret different arrhythmias. RESULTS: Poincaré plot representation of RR interval data revealed a wide variety of visual patterns: (i) comet-shaped for sinus rhythm; (ii) torpedo-shaped for sinus bradycardia; (iii) cigarette-shaped for sinus tachycardia; (iv) butterfly-shaped for sinus tachycardia and isolated atrial premature complexes; (v) arrow-shaped for isolated premature complexes and inappropriate sinus tachycardia; (vi) inverted fan-shaped for sinus rhythm with frequent atrial premature complexes; (vii) tornado-shaped for atrial flutter and atrial tachycardia; and (viii) fan-shaped for atrial fibrillation. CONCLUSIONS: Modified Poincaré plots with smoothed lines connecting successive points could accurately classify different types of arrhythmias based on short RR interval sequence variability. Characteristic emergent patterns can be visually identified and eventually could be distinguished by an automatic classification system able to discern between arrhythmias. This work provides an alternative method to interpret time-delay plots obtained from short-term EKG signal recordings.

N2  - Discovering information encoded in non-invasively recorded biosignals which belies  an individual's well-being can help facilitate the development of low-cost unobtrusive medical device technologies, or enable the unsupervised performance of physiological assessments without excessive oversight from trained clinical personnel. Although the unobtrusive or unsupervised nature of such technologies often results in less accurate measures than their invasive or supervised counterparts, this disadvantage is typically outweighed by the ability to monitor larger populations than ever before. The expected consequential benefit will be an improvement in healthcare provision and health outcomes for all. The process of discovering indicators of health in unsupervised or unobtrusive biosignal recordings, or automatically ensuring the validity and quality of such signals, is best realized when following a proven systematic methodology. This paper provides a brief tutorial review of supervised learning, which is a sub-discipline of machine learning, and discusses its application in the development of algorithms to interpret biosignals acquired in unsupervised or semi-supervised environments, with the aim of estimating well-being. Some specific examples in the disparate application areas of telehealth electrocardiogram recording and calculating post-operative systemic vascular resistance are discussed in the context of this systematic approach for information discovery.

N2  - INTRODUCTION:  To prospectively evaluate the feasibility of single contrast bolus  high-pitch CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) subsequently followed by low-dose retrospectively ECG-gated cardiac CT (4D-cCT) in patients with suspected pulmonary embolism (PE) to accurately evaluate right ventricular (RV) function. MATERIALS AND METHODS:  62 patients (33 female, age 65.1 ± 17.5 years) underwent high-pitch CTPA examination with 80cc of iodinated contrast material. 5 s after the end of the high-pitch CTPA study, a low-dose retrospectively ECG-gated cardiac CT examination was automatically started. The volume CT dose index (CTDI vol) and dose length product (DLP) were recorded in all patients and the effective dose was calculated. For the assessment of image quality, attenuation was measured as Hounsfield units (HUs) within various regions of interest (ROIs). These ROIs were used to calculate the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR). Subjective image quality was assessed using a five-point Likert scale. On 4D-cCT, the ejection fraction of both ventricles (RVEF, LVEF) as well as the ratio of RVEF and LVEF (RVEF/LVEF) was assessed. The statistical difference of all parameters between the PE and non-PE group was calculated. RESULTS:  The mean effective radiation dose was 4.22 ± 2.05 mSv. Attenuation measurements on CTPA showed the highest attenuation values in the main pulmonary artery (442.01 ± 187.64). On 4D-cCT attenuation values were highest in the descending aorta (560.59 ± 208.81). The CNR and SNR values on CTPA were highest within the main pulmonary artery (CNR = 12.43 ± 4.57; SNR = 15.14 ± 4.90). On 4D-cCT images, the highest SNR and CNR could be measured in the descending aorta (CNR = 10.26 ± 5.57; SNR = 10.86 ± 5.17). The mean LVEF was 60.73 %± 14.65 %, and the mean RVEF was 44.90 %± 9.54 %. The mean RVEF/LVEF was 0.79 ± 0.29. There was no significant difference between the PE and non-PE group for either of the parameters. CONCLUSION:  The investigated combined CTPA and 4D-cCT protocol is feasible using a single contrast bolus and allows the evaluation of RV function in patients with suspected PE. Further studies have to evaluate the additional value of this protocol regarding risk stratification in patients with PE. KEY POINTS:   · High-pitch CTPA is fast enough to leave sufficient contrast material within the heart that can be used for an additional low-dose functional cardiac CT examination.. · The tube current of the evaluated 4D-cCT is reduced over the entire cardiac cycle without any full dose peak.. · Low-dose cardiac CT subsequently performed after high-pitch CTPA allows for detailed analysis of RV function..

N2  - BACKGROUND: The use of coronary computed tomography (CT) angiography in children  with coronary artery anomalies is increasing. However, it remains technically demanding and the need to adapt acquisition parameters to a patient's cardiac characteristics has not yet been addressed. The aim of the study was to prospectively assess the feasibility of personalized multiphasic coronary CT angiography for pediatric patients. METHODS: Fifty pediatric patients (mean age 6.1±4.9 years) with coronary artery anomalies underwent a coronary CT angiography on a wide detector single-source CT equipment. Fifteen different acquisition patterns were used to trigger the acquisition at the best theoretical moment within the cardiac cycle. The appropriate pattern was automatically selected based on the patient's heart rate and heart rate variability, derived from the patient's ECG. Two independent radiologists qualitatively evaluated images. RESULTS: All acquisitions fully answered the clinical question for a mean effective dose of 0.97±0.34 mSv. Image quality qualified as good or excellent in 94% of cases (47/50). No examination was considered as not assessable but 6% (3/50) were scored as adequate for diagnosis. For these 3 patients, motion artifacts were the main cause of average image quality. No significant visual differences were reported between the different coronary arteries (mean score of 3.6 on a 4-point scale). No correlation between image quality and cardiac parameters were reported ( r=-0.19 and r=0.00, respectively for heart rate and heart rate variability). CONCLUSIONS: Personalized multiphasic coronary CT angiography acquisitions could be performed with diagnostic quality for a dose equivalent of <4 months of natural background irradiation.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia/cardiomyopathy (ARVD/C) is  characterized by delay in depolarization of the right ventricle, detected by prolonged terminal activation duration (TAD) in V1-V3. However, manual ECG measurements have shown moderate-to-low intra- and inter-reader agreement. The goal of this study was to assess reproducibility of automated ECG measurements in the right precordial leads. METHODS: Pairs of ECGs recorded in the same day from Johns Hopkins ARVD/C Registry participants [n=247, mean age 35.2±15.6 y, 58% men, 92% whites, 11(4.5%) with definite ARVD/C] were retrospectively analyzed. QRS duration, intrinsicoid deflection, TAD, and T-wave amplitude in the right precordial leads, as well as averaged across all leads QRS duration, QRS axis, T axis, QTc interval, and heart rate was measured automatically, using 12SL TM algorithm (GE Healthcare, Wauwatosa, WI, USA). Intrinsicoid deflection was measured as the time from QRS complex onset to the alignment point of the QRS complex. TAD was calculated as the difference between QRS duration and intrinsicoid in V1, V2, V3. Reproducibility was quantified by Bland-Altman analysis (bias with 95% limits of agreement), Lin's concordance coefficient, and Bradley-Blackwood procedure. RESULTS: Bland-Altman analysis revealed satisfactory reproducibility of tested parameters. V1 QRS duration bias was -0.10ms [95% limits of agreement -12.77 to 12.56ms], V2 QRS duration bias -0.09ms [-11.13 to 10.96ms]; V1 TAD bias 0.14ms [-13.23 to 13.51ms], V2 TAD bias 0.008ms [-12.42 to 12.44ms]. CONCLUSION: Comprehensive statistical evaluation of reproducibility of automated ECG measurements is important for appropriate interpretation of ECG. Automated ECG measurements are reproducible to within 25%.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between heart rate (HR) and  optimal reconstruction phase in prospectively electrocardiogram (ECG)-triggered coronary CT angiography (CCTA) performed on a newly introduced 256-slice multidetector CT (MDCT). METHODS: All the cases were selected retrospectively from the patients scheduled for CCTA in our department between January and April 2017. The scanner selected the optimal exposure phase based on 10 s ECG recordings. To ensure the success of CCTA, the operator also checked patient's age, breathing control, emotional status and past medical history to decide whether the automatically selected scan phase needs manual adjustment or not. Images were reconstructed in 1% steps of the R-R interval to determine the cardiac phase with least coronary motion. If CCTA images showed moderate motion blurring or discontinuity in the course of coronary segments, a cardiac motion correction algorithm was applied to the reconstructed images. Subjective diagnostic image quality was evaluated with 4-point grading scale. RESULTS: A total of 87 consecutive CCTA examinations were investigated in this study. Diastolic reconstruction was applied to all vessel segments in patients with HR <63 bpm, where 36.5 and 77.8% of vessel segments were reconstructed with the use of motion correction in HR ≤57 and 58-62 bpm, respectively. As for patients with HR ≥63 bpm, 89.3 and 71.7% of vessel segments were reconstructed in diastole in HR 63-67 and ≥68 bpm, respectively, while 81 and 100% of vessel segments were reconstructed with the use of motion correction in the same HR groups. CONCLUSION: Based on our results, a HR less than 67 bpm can be used to identify appropriate patients for diastolic reconstruction. Although the motion correction algorithm is an effective approach to reduce the impact of cardiac motion in CCTA, HR control is still important to optimize the image quality of CCTA. The relationship between HR and optimal reconstruction phase established in this study could be further used to tailor the ECG pulsing window for dose reduction in patients undergoing CCTA performed on the 256-slice MDCT. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: The HR thresholds to identify patients who are the best suitable candidates for diastolic or systolic reconstruction are scanner specific. This study investigated the relationship between HR and optimal reconstruction phase in prospectively ECG-triggered CCTA for a newly introduced 256-slice MDCT. Once the relationship is established, it could be used to tailor the ECG pulsing window for radiation dose reduction.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The computer-aided detection of cardiac arrhythmias stills a crucial  application in medical technologies. The rule based systems RBS ensure a high level of transparency and interpretability of the obtained results. AIM: To facilitate the diagnosis of the cardiologists and to reduce the uncertainty made in this diagnosis. METHODS: In this research article, we have realized a classification and automatic recognition of cardiac arrhythmias, by using XML rules that represent the cardiologist knowledge. Thirteen experiments with different knowledge bases were realized for improving the performance of the used method in the detection of 13 cardiac arrhythmias. In the first 12 experiments, we have designed a specialized knowledge base for each cardiac arrhythmia, which contains just one arrhythmia detection rule. In the last experiment, we applied the knowledge base which contains rules of 12 arrhythmias. We used, for the experiments, an international data set with 279 features and 452 records characterizing 12 leads of ECG signal and social information of patients. The data sets were constructed and published at Bilkent University of Ankara, Turkey. In addition, the second version of the self-developed software "XMLRULE" was used; the software can infer more than one class and facilitate the interpretability of the obtained results. RESULTS: The 12 first experiments give 82.80% of correct detection as the mean of all experiments, the results were between 19% and 100% with a low rate in just one experiment. The last experiment in which all arrhythmias are considered, the results of correct detection was 38.33% with 90.55% of sensibility and 46.24% of specificity. It was clearly show that in these results the good choice of the classification model is very beneficial in terms of performance. The obtained results were better than the published results with other computational methods for the mono class detection, but it was less in multi-class detection. CONCLUSION: The RBS is the most transparent method for cardiac arrhythmias detection and multi arrhythmias detection. It improves an exceptional recognition of arrhythmias, but due to conflicts between rules, multi-arrhythmias and uncertainty of measures, the rate of correct classification was less than the other methods.

N2  - Catheter ablation has emerged as an effective treatment strategy for atrial  fibrillation (AF) in recent years. During AF, complex fractionated atrial electrograms (CFAE) can be recorded and are known to be a potential target for ablation. Automatic algorithms have been developed to simplify CFAE detection, but they are often based on a single descriptor or a set of descriptors in combination with sharp decision classifiers. However, these methods do not reflect the progressive transition between CFAE classes. The aim of this study was to develop an automatic classification algorithm, which combines the information of a complete set of descriptors and allows for progressive and transparent decisions. We designed a method to automatically analyze CFAE based on a set of descriptors representing various aspects, such as shape, amplitude and temporal characteristics. A fuzzy decision tree (FDT) was trained and evaluated on 429 predefined electrograms. CFAE were classified into four subgroups with a correct rate of 81±3%. Electrograms with continuous activity were detected with a correct rate of 100%. In addition, a percentage of certainty is given for each electrogram to enable a comprehensive and transparent decision. The proposed FDT is able to classify CFAE with respect to their progressive transition and may allow objective and reproducible CFAE interpretation for clinical use.

N2  - A novel multimodal and bio-inspired approach to biomedical signal processing and  classification is presented in the paper. This approach allows for an automatic semantic labeling (interpretation) of sleep apnea events based the proposed data-driven biomedical signal processing and classification. The presented signal processing and classification methods have been already successfully applied to real-time unimodal brainwaves (EEG only) decoding in brain-computer interfaces developed by the author. In the current project the very encouraging results are obtained using multimodal biomedical (brainwaves and peripheral physiological) signals in a unified processing approach allowing for the automatic semantic data description. The results thus support a hypothesis of the data-driven and bio-inspired signal processing approach validity for medical data semantic interpretation based on the sleep apnea events machine-learning-related classification.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Left bundle branch block is recognized as a marker of higher risk of  death, but the prognostic value of the right bundle branch block in the general population is still controversial. Our aim is to evaluate the risk of overall and cardiovascular mortality in patients with right (RBBB) and left bundle branch block (LBBB) in a large electronic cohort of Brazilian patients. METHODS: This observational retrospective study was developed with the database of digital ECGs from Telehealth Network of Minas Gerais, Brazil (TNMG). All ECGs performed from 2010 to 2017 in primary care patients over 16 years old were assessed. The electronic cohort was obtained by linking data from ECG exams (name, sex, date of birth, city of residence) and those from national mortality information system, using standard probabilistic linkage methods (FRIL: Fine-grained record linkage software, v.2.1.5, Atlanta, GA). Only the first ECG of each patient was considered. Clinical data were self-reported, and ECGs were interpreted manually by cardiologists and automatically by the Glasgow University Interpreter software. Hazard ratio (HR) for mortality was estimated using Cox regression. RESULTS: From a dataset of 1,773,689 patients, 1,558,421 primary care patients over 16 years old underwent a valid ECG recording during 2010 to 2017. We excluded 17,359 patients that didn't have a valid QRS measure from the Glasgow program and 11,091 patients from the control group that had QRS equal or above 120 ms and were not RBBB or LBBB. Therefore, 1,529,971 were included (median age 52 [Q1:38; Q3:65] years; 40.2% were male). In a mean follow-up of 3.7 years, the overall mortality rate was 3.34%. RBBB was more frequent (2.42%) than LBBB (1.32%). In multivariate analysis, adjusting for sex, age and comorbidities, both patients with RBBB (HR 1.32; CI 95% 1.27-1.37) and LBBB (HR 1.69; CI 95% 1.62-1.76) had higher risk of overall mortality. Women with RBBB had an increased risk of all-cause death compared to men (p < 0.001). Cardiovascular mortality was higher in patients with LBBB (HR 1.77; CI 95% 1.55-2.01), but not for RBBB. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with RBBB and LBBB had higher risk of overall mortality. Women with RBBB had more risk of all-cause death than men. LBBB was associated with higher risk of cardiovascular mortality.

N2  - Trunk muscle electromyography (EMG) is often contaminated by the electrocardiogram  (ECG), which hampers data analysis and potentially yields misinterpretations. We propose the use of independent component analysis (ICA) for removing ECG contamination and compared it with other procedures previously developed to decontaminate EMG. To mimic realistic contamination while having uncontaminated reference signals, we employed EMG recordings from peripheral muscles with different activation patterns and superimposed distinct ECG signals that were recorded during rest at conventional locations for trunk muscle EMG. ICA decomposition was performed with and without a separately collected ECG signal as part of the data set and contaminated ICA modes representing ECG were identified automatically. Root mean squared relative errors and correlations between the linear envelopes of uncontaminated and contaminated EMG were calculated to assess filtering effects on EMG amplitude. Changes in spectral content were quantified via mean power frequencies. ICA-based filtering largely preserved the EMG's spectral content. Performance on amplitude measures was especially successful when a separate ECG recording was included. That is, the ICA-based filtering can produce excellent results when EMG and ECG are indeed statistically independent and when mode selection is flexibly adjusted to the data set under study.

N2  - Sudden cardiac death is the most common cause of unnatural death in football. To  prevent and urgently manage sudden cardiac arrest on the football field-of-play, F-MARC (FIFA Medical and Research Centre) has been fully committed to a programme of research, education, standardisation and practical implementation. This strategy has detected football players at medical risk during mandatory precompetition medical assessments. Additionally, FIFA has (1) sponsored internationally accepted guidelines for the interpretation of an athlete's ECG, (2) developed field-of-play-specific protocols for the recognition, response, resuscitation and removal of a football player having sudden cardiac arrest and (3) introduced and distributed the FIFA medical emergency bag which has already resulted in the successful resuscitation of a football player who had a sudden cardiac arrest on the field-of-play. Recently FIFA, in association with the Institute of Sports and Preventive Medicine in Saarbrücken, Germany, established a worldwide Sudden Death Registry with a view to documenting fatal events on the football field-of-play. These activities by F-MARC are testimony to FIFA's continued commitment to minimising sudden cardiac arrest while playing football.

N2  - Fetal heart rate (FHR) monitoring is routinely used in clinical practice to help  obstetricians assess fetal health status during delivery. However, early detection of fetal acidosis that allows relevant decisions for operative delivery remains a challenging task, receiving considerable attention. This contribution promotes sparse support vector machine classification that permits to select a small number of relevant features and to achieve efficient fetal acidosis detection. A comprehensive set of features is used for FHR description, including enhanced and computerized clinical features, frequency domain, and scaling and multifractal features, all computed on a large (1288 subjects) and well-documented database. The individual performance obtained for each feature independently is discussed first. Then, it is shown that the automatic selection of a sparse subset of features achieves satisfactory classification performance (sensitivity 0.73 and specificity 0.75, outperforming clinical practice). The subset of selected features (average depth of decelerations MAD(dtrd), baseline level β(0) , and variability H) receives simple interpretation in clinical practice. Intrapartum fetal acidosis detection is improved in several respects: A comprehensive set of features combining clinical, spectral, and scale-free dynamics is used; an original multivariate classification targeting both sparse feature selection and high performance is devised; state-of-the-art performance is obtained on a much larger database than that generally studied with description of common pitfalls in supervised classification performance assessments.

N2  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) is often asymptomatic  and increases the risk of ischaemic stroke. Detection of PAF is challenging but crucial because a change of treatment decreases the risk of ischaemic stroke. Post-stroke investigations recommend at least 24-h continuous cardiac rhythm monitoring. Extended monitoring detects more PAF but is limited by costs due to manual analysis. Interpretive software might be a reasonable screening tool. The aim was to validate the performance and utility of Pathfinder SL software compared to manual analysis. METHODS: In all, 135 ischaemic stroke patients with no prior history of PAF or atrial fibrillation and who had done a 7-day continuous electrocardiogram monitoring (Holter) were included. Manual analysis was compared with Pathfinder SL software including a systematic control of registered events. RESULTS: Seventeen (12.6%) patients were diagnosed with PAF (atrial fibrillation > 30 s). Pathfinder SL software including a systematic control of events registered 16 (94.1%) patients with PAF. Manually 15 (88.2%) patients were detected with PAF. Pathfinder SL had a negative predictive value of 99% and sensitivity of 94%. CONCLUSIONS: Pathfinder SL software including a systematic evaluation of events is an acceptable alternative compared to manual analysis in PAF detection following ischaemic stroke. It is less time consuming and therefore a reliable, cheaper alternative compared to manual analysis.

N2  - PURPOSE: A new technique is demonstrated for extensive high-resolution  intra-operative atrial mapping that will facilitate the localization of atrial fibrillation (AF) sources and identification of the substrate perpetuating AF. METHODS: Prior to the start of extra-corporal circulation, a 8 × 24-electrode array (2-mm inter-electrode distance) is placed subsequently on all the right and left epicardial atrial sites, including Bachmann's bundle, for recording of unipolar electrograms during sinus rhythm and (induced) AF. AF is induced by high-frequency pacing at the right atrial free wall. A pacemaker wire stitched to the right atrium serves as a reference signal. The indifferent pole is connected to a steal wire fixed to subcutaneous tissue. Electrograms are recorded by a computerized mapping system and, after amplification (gain 1000), filtering (bandwidth 0.5-400 Hz), sampling (1 kHz) and analogue to digital conversion (16 bits), automatically stored on hard disk. During the mapping procedure, real-time visualization secures electrogram quality. Analysis will be performed offline. RESULTS: This technique was performed in 168 patients of 18 years and older, with coronary and/or structural heart disease, with or without AF, electively scheduled for cardiac surgery and a ventricular ejection fraction above 40 %. The mean duration of the entire mapping procedure including preparation time was 9 ± 2 min. Complications related to the mapping procedure during or after cardiac surgery were not observed. CONCLUSIONS: We introduce the first epicardial atrial mapping approach with a high resolution of ≥1728 recording sites which can be performed in a procedure time of only 9±2 mins. This mapping technique can potentially identify areas responsible for initiation and persistence of AF and hopefully can individualize both diagnosis and therapy of AF.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Precise measurement of the QT interval is often hampered by difficulty  determining the end of the low amplitude T wave. Root mean square electrocardiography (RMS ECG) provides a novel alternative measure of ventricular repolarization. Experimental data have shown that the interval between the RMS ECG QRS and T wave peaks (RTPK) closely reflects the mean ventricular action potential duration while the RMS T wave width (TW) tracks the dispersion of repolarization timing. Here, we tested the precision of RMS ECG to assess ventricular repolarization in humans in the setting of drug-induced and congenital Long QT Syndrome (LQTS). METHODS: RMS ECG signals were derived from high-resolution 24 hour Holter monitor recordings from 68 subjects after receiving placebo and moxifloxacin and from standard 12 lead ECGs obtained in 97 subjects with LQTS and 97 age- and sex-matched controls. RTPK, QTRMS and RMS TW intervals were automatically measured using custom software and compared to traditional QT measures using lead II. RESULTS: All measures of repolarization were prolonged during moxifloxacin administration and in LQTS subjects, but the variance of RMS intervals was significantly smaller than traditional lead II measurements. TW was prolonged during moxifloxacin and in subjects with LQT-2, but not LQT-1 or LQT-3. CONCLUSION: These data validate the application of RMS ECG for the detection of drug-induced and congenital LQTS. RMS ECG measurements are more precise than the current standard of care lead II measurements.

N2  - The detection of stenotic plaques strongly depends on the quality of the coronary  arterial tree imaged with coronary CT angiography (cCTA). However, it is time consuming for the radiologist to select the best-quality vessels from the multiple-phase cCTA for interpretation in clinical practice. We are developing an automated method for selection of the best-quality vessels from coronary arterial trees in multiple-phase cCTA to facilitate radiologist's reading or computerized analysis. Our automated method consists of vessel segmentation, vessel registration, corresponding vessel branch matching, vessel quality measure (VQM) estimation, and automatic selection of best branches based on VQM. For every branch, the VQM was calculated as the average radial gradient. An observer preference study was conducted to visually compare the quality of the selected vessels. 167 corresponding branch pairs were evaluated by two radiologists. The agreement between the first radiologist and the automated selection was 76% with kappa of 0.49. The agreement between the second radiologist and the automated selection was also 76% with kappa of 0.45. The agreement between the two radiologists was 81% with kappa of 0.57. The observer preference study demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed automated method for the selection of the best-quality vessels from multiple cCTA phases.

N2  - Biosignals such as electrocardiograms (ECG), electroencephalograms (EEG), and  electromyograms (EMG), are important noninvasive measurements useful for making diagnostic decisions. Recently, considerable research has been conducted in order to potentially automate signal classification for assisting in disease diagnosis. However, the biosignal type (ECG, EEG, EMG or other) needs to be known prior to the classification process. If the given biosignal is of an unknown type, none of the existing methodologies can be utilized. In this paper, a blind biosignal classification model (B(2)SC Model) is proposed in order to identify the source biosignal type automatically, and thus ultimately benefit the diagnostic decision. The approach employs time series algorithms for constructing the model. It uses a dynamic time warping (DTW) algorithm with clustering to discover the similarity between two biosignals, and consequently classifies disease without prior knowledge of the source signal type. The empirical experiments presented in this paper demonstrate the effectiveness of the method as well as the scalability of the approach.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Numerous self-gated cardiac imaging techniques have been reported in the  literature. Most can track either cardiac or respiratory motion, and many incur some overhead to imaging data acquisition. We previously described a Cartesian cine imaging technique, pseudo-projection motion tracking with golden-step phase encoding, capable of tracking both cardiac and respiratory motion at no cost to imaging data acquisition. In this work, we describe improvements to the technique by dramatically reducing its vulnerability to eddy current and flow artifacts and demonstrating its effectiveness in expanded cardiovascular applications. METHODS: As with our previous golden-step technique, the Cartesian phase encodes over time were arranged based on the integer golden step, and readouts near k(y) = 0 (pseudo-projections) were used to derive motion. In this work, however, the readouts were divided into equal and consecutive temporal segments, within which the readouts were sorted according to k(y). The sorting reduces the phase encode jump between consecutive readouts while maintaining the pseudo-randomness of k(y) to sample both cardiac and respiratory motion without comprising the ability to retrospectively set the temporal resolution of the original technique. On human volunteers, free-breathing, electrocardiographic (ECG)-free cine scans were acquired for all slices of the short axis stack and the 4-chamber view of the long axis. Retrospectively, cardiac motion and respiratory motion were automatically extracted from the pseudo-projections to guide cine reconstruction. The resultant image quality in terms of sharpness and cardiac functional metrics was compared against breath-hold ECG-gated reference cines. RESULTS: With sorting, motion tracking of both cardiac and respiratory motion was effective for all slices orientations imaged, and artifact occurrence due to eddy current and flow was efficiently eliminated. The image sharpness derived from the self-gated cines was found to be comparable to the reference cines (mean difference less than 0.05 mm(- 1) for short-axis images and 0.075 mm(- 1) for long-axis images), and the functional metrics (mean difference < 4 ml) were found not to be statistically different from those from the reference. CONCLUSIONS: This technique dramatically reduced the eddy current and flow artifacts while preserving the ability of cost-free motion tracking and the flexibility of choosing arbitrary navigator zone width, number of cardiac phases, and duration of scanning. With the restriction of the artifacts removed, the Cartesian golden-step cine imaging can now be applied to cardiac imaging slices of more diverse orientation and anatomy at greater reliability.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Differential blood oxygenation between left (LV) and right ventricles  (RV; ΔSaO(2)) is a key index of cardiac performance; LV dysfunction yields increased RV blood pool deoxygenation. Deoxyhemoglobin increases blood magnetic susceptibility, which can be measured using an emerging cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) technique, Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping (QSM) - a concept previously demonstrated in healthy subjects using a breath-hold 2D imaging approach (2D(BH)QSM). This study tested utility of a novel 3D free-breathing QSM approach (3D(NAV)QSM) in normative controls, and validated 3D(NAV)QSM for non-invasive ΔSaO(2) quantification in patients undergoing invasive cardiac catheterization (cath). METHODS: Initial control (n = 10) testing compared 2D(BH)QSM (ECG-triggered 2D gradient echo acquired at end-expiration) and 3D(NAV)QSM (ECG-triggered navigator gated gradient echo acquired in free breathing using a phase-ordered automatic window selection algorithm to partition data based on diaphragm position). Clinical testing was subsequently performed in patients being considered for cath, including 3D(NAV)QSM comparison to cine-CMR quantified LV function (n = 39), and invasive-cath quantified ΔSaO(2) (n = 15). QSM was acquired using 3 T scanners; analysis was blinded to comparator tests (cine-CMR, cath). RESULTS: 3D(NAV)QSM generated interpretable QSM in all controls; 2D(BH)QSM was successful in 6/10. Among controls in whom both pulse sequences were successful, RV/LV susceptibility difference (and ΔSaO(2)) were not significantly different between 3D(NAV)QSM and 2D(BH)QSM (252 ± 39 ppb [17.5 ± 3.1%] vs. 211 ± 29 ppb [14.7 ± 2.0%]; p = 0.39). Acquisition times were 30% lower with 3D(NAV)QSM (4.7 ± 0.9 vs. 6.7 ± 0.5 min, p = 0.002), paralleling a trend towards lower LV mis-registration on 3D(NAV)QSM (p = 0.14). Among cardiac patients (63 ± 10y, 56% CAD) 3D(NAV)QSM was successful in 87% (34/39) and yielded higher ΔSaO(2) (24.9 ± 6.1%) than in controls (p < 0.001). QSM-calculated ΔSaO(2) was higher among patients with LV dysfunction as measured on cine-CMR based on left ventricular ejection fraction (29.4 ± 5.9% vs. 20.9 ± 5.7%, p < 0.001) or stroke volume (27.9 ± 7.5% vs. 22.4 ± 5.5%, p = 0.013). Cath measurements (n = 15) obtained within a mean interval of 4 ± 3 days from CMR demonstrated 3D(NAV)QSM to yield high correlation (r = 0.87, p < 0.001), small bias (- 0.1%), and good limits of agreement (±8.6%) with invasively measured ΔSaO(2). CONCLUSION: 3D(NAV)QSM provides a novel means of assessing cardiac performance. Differential susceptibility between the LV and RV is increased in patients with cine-CMR evidence of LV systolic dysfunction; QSM-quantified ΔSaO(2) yields high correlation and good agreement with the reference of invasively-quantified ΔSaO(2).

N2  - Early repolarization associated with sudden cardiac death is based on the presence  of >1-mm J-point elevations in inferior and/or lateral leads with horizontal and/or downsloping ST segments. Automated electrocardiographic readings of early repolarization (AER) obtained in clinical practice, in contrast, are defined by ST-segment elevation in addition to J-point elevation. Nonetheless, such automated readings may cause alarm. We therefore assessed the prevalence and prognostic significance of AER in 211,920 patients aged 18 to 75 years. The study was performed at a tertiary medical center serving a racially diverse urban population with a large proportion of Hispanics (43%). The first recorded electrocardiogram of each individual from 2000 to 2012 was included. Patients with ventricular paced rhythm or acute coronary syndrome at the time of acquisition were excluded from the analysis. All automated electrocardiographic interpretations were reviewed for accuracy by a board-certified cardiologist. The primary end point was death during a median follow-up of 8.0 ± 2.6 years. AER was present in 3,450 subjects (1.6%). The prevalence varied significantly with race (African-Americans 2.2%, Hispanics 1.5%, and non-Hispanic whites 0.9%, p <0.01) and gender (male 2.4% vs female 0.6%, p <0.001). In a Cox proportional hazards model controlling for age, smoking status, heart rate, QTc, systolic blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, body mass index, and coronary artery disease, there was no significant difference in mortality regardless of race or gender (relative risk 0.98, 95% confidence interval 0.89 to 1.07). This was true even if J waves were present. In conclusion, AER was not associated with an increased risk of death, regardless of race or gender, and should not trigger additional diagnostic testing.

N2  - PURPOSE: We evaluated the usefulness of an automatic slice-alignment method to  simplify planning of cardiac magnetic resonance (MR) scans with a 3-tesla scanner. METHODS: We obtained 2-dimensional (2D) axial multislice images using steady-state free precession (SSFP) sequences covering the whole heart at the end-diastole phase with electrocardiography (ECG) gating in 38 patients. We detected several anatomical feature points of the heart and calculated all planes required for cardiac imaging based on those points. We visually evaluated the acceptability of an acquired imaging plane and measured the angular differences of each view between the results obtained by this method and by a conventional manual pointing approach. RESULTS: The average visual scores were 3.4 ± 1.0 for short-axis images, 3.2 ± 0.9 for 4-chamber images, 3.2 ± 0.8 for 2-chamber images, and 3.3 ± 0.8 for 3-chamber images; average angular differences were 5.8 ± 5.1 (short axis), 7.7 ± 5.7 (4-chamber), 11.5 ± 6.7 (2-chamber), and 9.1 ± 4.6 degrees (3-chamber). Processing time was within 1.8 s in all subjects. CONCLUSION: The proposed method can provide planes within the clinically acceptable range and within a short time in cardiac imaging of patients with various cardiac shapes and diseases without the need for high level operator proficiency in performing the examination and interpreting results.

N2  - Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common sleep disorder that often remains  undiagnosed, leading to an increased risk of developing cardiovascular diseases. Polysomnogram (PSG) is currently used as a golden standard for screening OSA. However, because it is time consuming, expensive and causes discomfort, alternative techniques based on a reduced set of physiological signals are proposed to solve this problem. This study proposes a convenient non-parametric kernel density-based approach for detection of OSA using single-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings. Selected physiologically interpretable features are extracted from segmented RR intervals, which are obtained from ECG signals. These features are fed into the kernel density classifier to detect apnea event and bandwidths for density of each class (normal or apnea) are automatically chosen through an iterative bandwidth selection algorithm. To validate the proposed approach, RR intervals are extracted from ECG signals of 35 subjects obtained from a sleep apnea database ( http://physionet.org/cgi-bin/atm/ATM ). The results indicate that the kernel density classifier, with two features for apnea event detection, achieves a mean accuracy of 82.07 %, with mean sensitivity of 83.23 % and mean specificity of 80.24 %. Compared with other existing methods, the proposed kernel density approach achieves a comparably good performance but by using fewer features without significantly losing discriminant power, which indicates that it could be widely used for home-based screening or diagnosis of OSA.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are a promising technology for restoring  motor ability to paralyzed patients. Spiking-based BCIs have successfully been used in clinical trials to control multi-degree-of-freedom robotic devices. Current implementations of these devices require a lengthy spike-sorting step, which is an obstacle to moving this technology from the lab to the clinic. A viable alternative is to avoid spike-sorting, treating all threshold crossings of the voltage waveform on an electrode as coming from one putative neuron. It is not known, however, how much decoding information might be lost by ignoring spike identity. APPROACH: We present a full analysis of the effects of spike-sorting schemes on decoding performance. Specifically, we compare how well two common decoders, the optimal linear estimator and the Kalman filter, reconstruct the arm movements of non-human primates performing reaching tasks, when receiving input from various sorting schemes. The schemes we tested included: using threshold crossings without spike-sorting; expert-sorting discarding the noise; expert-sorting, including the noise as if it were another neuron; and automatic spike-sorting using waveform features. We also decoded from a joint statistical model for the waveforms and tuning curves, which does not involve an explicit spike-sorting step. MAIN RESULTS: Discarding the threshold crossings that cannot be assigned to neurons degrades decoding: no spikes should be discarded. Decoding based on spike-sorted units outperforms decoding based on electrodes voltage crossings: spike-sorting is useful. The four waveform based spike-sorting methods tested here yield similar decoding efficiencies: a fast and simple method is competitive. Decoding using the joint waveform and tuning model shows promise but is not consistently superior. SIGNIFICANCE: Our results indicate that simple automated spike-sorting performs as well as the more computationally or manually intensive methods used here. Even basic spike-sorting adds value to the low-threshold waveform-crossing methods often employed in BCI decoding.

N2  - AIMS: Intracardiac electrograms (IEGMs) are essential for the assessment of  implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) function. The Biotronik Home Monitoring systems transmit an 'IEGM Online' that is shorter than the full-length programmer IEGM due to technical constrains. The aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of the physician's classification of the underlying rhythm based on the second-generation IEGM Online. METHODS AND RESULTS: In total, 1533 patients treated with single- and dual-chamber ICDs and cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillators were enrolled at 67 investigational sites and followed for 15 months. The investigators classified the rhythm shown in IEGM Online as ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, atrial fibrillation, other supraventricular tachyarrhythmia, oversensing due to lead failure, T-wave oversensing, or other rhythm. At the next in-office follow-up, the investigators classified independently the rhythm seen in the corresponding programmer IEGM. The two rhythm classifications were compared thereafter. Both IEGM Online and programmer IEGM were available in 2099 arrhythmic or oversensing events, of which 146 (7.0%) were classified as other rhythm or artefacts and were excluded as inconclusive or atypical. The remaining 1953 events, affecting 352 patients (23.0%), were classified correctly in 1803 cases (92.3%). The accuracy of rough rhythm classification as ventricular, supraventricular, or oversensing was 97.2%. CONCLUSION: The Lumax and IEGM Online HD Evaluation study demonstrates that remote IEGM analysis is reasonably accurate in a remote monitoring system that transmits shorter IEGM than the full-length programmer IEGM for the sake of frequent, fully automatic data transmission.

N2  - Lately, multimodal approaches for automatic emotion recognition have gained  significant scientific interest. In this paper, emotion recognition by combining physiological signals and facial expressions was studied. Heart rate variability parameters, respiration frequency, and facial expressions were used to classify person's emotions while watching pictures with emotional content. Three classes were used for both valence and arousal. The preliminary results show that, over the proposed channels, detecting arousal seem to be easier compared to valence. While the classification performance of 54.5% was attained with arousal, only 38.0% of the samples were classified correctly in terms of valence. In future, additional modalities as well as feature selection will be utilized to improve the results.

N2  - Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals are difficult to interpret, and clinicians must  undertake a long training process to learn to diagnose diabetes from subtle abnormalities in these signals. To facilitate these diagnoses, we have developed a technique based on the heart rate variability signal obtained from ECG signals. This technique uses digital signal processing methods and, therefore, automates the detection of diabetes from ECG signals. In this paper, we describe the signal processing techniques that extract features from heart rate (HR) signals and present an analysis procedure that uses these features to diagnose diabetes. Through statistical analysis, we have identified the correlation dimension, Poincaré geometry properties (SD2), and recurrence plot properties (REC, DET, L(mean)) as useful features. These features differentiate the HR data of diabetic patients from those of patients who do not have the illness, and have been validated by using the AdaBoost classifier with the perceptron weak learner (yielding a classification accuracy of 86%). We then developed a novel diabetic integrated index (DII) that is a combination of these nonlinear features. The DII indicates whether a particular HR signal was taken from a person with diabetes. This index aids the automatic detection of diabetes, thereby allowing a more objective assessment and freeing medical professionals for other tasks.

N2  - Three-dimensional (3D)-imaging provides important information on cardiac anatomy  during electrophysiological procedures. Real-time updates of modalities with high soft-tissue contrast are particularly advantageous during cardiac procedures. Therefore, a beat to beat 3D visualization of cardiac anatomy by intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) was developed and tested in phantoms and animals. An electronic phased-array 5-10 MHz ICE-catheter (Acuson, AcuNav/Siemens Medical Solutions USA/64 elements) providing a 90° sector image was used for ICE-imaging. A custom-made mechanical prototype controlled by a servo motor allowed automatic rotation of the ICE-catheter around its longitudinal axis. During a single heartbeat, the ICE-catheter was rotated and 2D-images were acquired. Reconstruction into a 3D volume and rendering by a prototype software was performed beat to beat. After experimental validation using a rigid phantom, the system was tested in an animal study and afterwards, for quantitative validation, in a dynamic phantom. Acquisition of beat to beat 3D-reconstruction was technically feasible. However, twisting of the ICE-catheter shaft due to friction and torsion was found and rotation was hampered. Also, depiction of catheters was not always ensured in case of parallel alignment. Using a curved sheath for depiction of cardiac anatomy there was no congruent depiction of shape and dimension of static and moving objects. Beat to beat 3D-ICE-imaging is feasible. However, shape and dimension of static and moving objects cannot always be displayed with necessary steadiness as needed in the clinical setting. As catheter depiction is also limited, clinical use seems impossible.

N2  - We address the problem of segmenting nearly periodic time series into period-like  segments. We introduce a definition of nearly periodic time series via triplets 〈 basic shape, shape transformation, time scaling 〉 that covers a wide range of time series. To split the time series into periods, we select a pair of principal components of the Hankel matrix. We then cut the trajectory of the selected principal components by its symmetry axis and, thus, obtaining half-periods that are merged into segments. We describe a method of automatic selection of periodic pairs of principal components, corresponding to the fundamental periodicity. We demonstrate the application of the proposed method to the problem of period extraction for accelerometric time series of human gait. We see the automatic segmentation into periods as a problem of major importance for human activity recognition problem, since it allows to obtain interpretable segments: each extracted period can be seen as an ultimate entity of gait. The method we propose is more general compared to the application specific methods and can be used for any nearly periodical time series. We compare its performance to classical mathematical methods of period extraction and find that it is not only comparable to the alternatives, but in some cases performs better.

N2  - PURPOSE: To demonstrate radial golden-ratio-based cardiac cine imaging by using  interspersed one-dimensional (1D) navigators. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The 1D navigators were interspersed into the acquisition of radial spokes which were continuously rotated by an angle increment based on the golden-ratio. Performing correlation analysis between the 1D navigator projections, time points corresponding to the same cardiac motion phases were automatically identified and used to combine retrospectively golden-ratio rotated radial spokes from multiple data windows. Data windows were shifted consecutively for dynamic reconstruction of different cardiac motion frames. Experiments were performed during a single breathhold. By artificially reducing the amount of input data, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) as well as artifact level was evaluated for different breathhold durations. RESULTS: Analysis of the 1D navigator data provided a detailed correlation function revealing cardiac motion over time. Imaging results were comparable to images reconstructed based on a timely synchronized ECG. Cardiac cine images with a low artifact level and good image quality in terms of SNR and CNR were reconstructed from volunteer data achieving a CNR between the myocardium and the left ventricular cavity of 50 for the longest breathhold duration of 26 s. CNR maintained a value higher than 30 for acquisition times as low as 10 s. CONCLUSION: Combining radial golden-ratio-based imaging with an intrinsic navigator is a promising and robust method for performing high quality cardiac cine imaging.

N2  - Heart rate variability (HRV) is a particularly valuable quantitative marker of the  flexibility and balance of the autonomic nervous system. Significant advances in software programs to automatically derive HRV have led to its extensive use in psychophysiological research. However, there is a lack of systematic comparisons across software programs used to derive HRV indices. Further, researchers report meager details on important signal processing decisions making synthesis across studies challenging. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the measurement fidelity of time- and frequency-domain HRV indices derived from three predominant signal processing software programs commonly used in clinical and research settings. Triplicate ECG recordings were derived from 20 participants using identical data acquisition hardware. Among the time-domain indices, there was strong to excellent correspondence (ICC(avg)=0.93) for SDNN, SDANN, SDNNi, rMSSD, and pNN50. The frequency-domain indices yielded excellent correspondence (ICC(avg)=0.91) for LF, HF, and LF/HF ratio, except for VLF which exhibited poor correspondence (ICC(avg)=0.19). Stringent user-decisions and technical specifications for nuanced HRV processing details are essential to ensure measurement fidelity across signal processing software programs.

N2  - Enlargement and dysfunction of the right ventricle (RV) is a sign and outcome  predictor of many cardiopulmonary diseases. Due to the complex geometry of the RV exact volumetry is cumbersome and time-consuming. We evaluated the performance of prototype software for fully automated RV segmentation and volumetry from cardiac CT data. In 50 retrospectively ECG-gated coronary CT angiography scans the endsystolic (RVVmin) and enddiastolic (RVVmax) volume of the right ventricle was calculated fully automatically by prototype software. Manual slice segmentation by two independent radiologists served as the reference standard. Measurement periods were compared for both methods. RV volumes calculated with the software were in strong agreement with the results from manual slice segmentation (Bland-Altman r = 0.95-0.98; p < 0.001; Lin's correlation Rho = 0.87-0.96, p < 0.001) for RVVmax and RVVmin with excellent interobserver agreement between both radiologists (r = 0.97; p < 0.001). The measurement period was significantly shorter with the software (153 ± 9 s) than with manual slice segmentation (658 ± 211 s). The prototype software demonstrated very good performance in comparison to the reference standard. It promises robust RV volume results and minimizes postprocessing time.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to assess by a census supported by the Italian  Society of Cardiology (Società Italiana di Cardiologia, SIC) the present implementation of telemedicine in the field of cardiovascular disease in Italy. METHODS: A dedicated questionnaire was sent by email to all the members of the SIC: data on telemedicine providers, service provided, reimbursement, funding and organisational solutions were collected and analysed. RESULTS: Reported telemedicine activities were mostly stable and public hospital based, focused on acute cardiovascular disease and prehospital triage of suspected acute myocardial infarction (prehospital ECG, always interpreted by a cardiologist and not automatically reported by computerised algorithms). Private companies delivering telemedicine services in cardiology (ECGs, ambulatory ECG monitoring) were also present. In 16% of cases, ECGs were also delivered through pharmacies or general practitioners. ICD/CRT-D remote control was performed in 42% of cases, heart failure patient remote monitoring in 37% (21% vital parameters monitoring, 32% nurse telephone monitoring). Telemedicine service was public in 74% of cases, paid by the patient in 26%. About half of telemedicine service received no funding, 17% received State and/or European Union funding. CONCLUSIONS: Several telemedicine activities have been reported for the management of acute and chronic cardiovascular disease in Italy. The whole continuum of cardiovascular disease is covered by telemedicine solutions. A periodic census may be useful to assess the implementation of guidelines recommendations on telemedicine.

Postsurgical cases, those with significant risk factors, or patients with chronic conditions are candidates for these procedures to assess evolving risk factors and detect life-threatening events. A small sensing device can be implanted subcutaneously to assess the ECG, transmitting status and alerts to local caregivers or a remote monitoring service. We and others have shown that a differential electrode pair with only 2- to 3-cm spacing can produce QRS amplitudes greater than 1 mV, sufficient to accurately identify asystole, tachyarrhythmias, and ST-segment changes. Medtronic's REVEAL and St Jude Medical's CONFIRM are implantable look recorders (ILRs) with a single pair of subcutaneous electrodes mounted on the surface of the case (6 × 2 × 0.7 cm). They store representative rhythm strips when the heart rate exceeds preset limits or when the patient presses a button on the accompanying actuator. These records may be transferred for physician review during a subsequent office visit. Transoma's SLEUTH is a similar ILR, except that one of the electrodes is at the end of a 6-cm lead tunneled under the skin and the wider separation may result in a larger ECG amplitude. Instead of storing the records, SLEUTH transmits them through the skin to a home base unit, which sends them via telephone to a monitoring service. Angel Medical's ALERT system also has a tunneled lead, but one that is introduced pervenously into the right ventricle hoping to detect ST changes in addition to rhythm abnormalities. Advanced multivector ILR devices with integrated event alerting are rapidly approaching commercialization. AJ Medical Devices' CARDIOALARM (4 × 4 × 0.6 cm) has 4 electrodes at the corners of the square package, arranged as 2 orthogonal recording pairs that can produce a robust signal that is relatively immune to signal fluctuations caused by changes in the direction of cardiac activation and patient's body position. This permits accurate identification of dramatic changes in the ECG pattern, such as those occurring in ventricular fibrillation and polymorphic tachycardia. Because of this feature, CARDIOALARM can detect cardiac arrest, and its external receiver can alert bystanders to begin cardiopulmonary resuscitation and can automatically summon Emergency Medical Services. In the future, addition of other sensors, integration of data streams via body surface wireless networks, and real-time interpretive algorithms will allow enhanced monitoring systems to more generally assess evolving risks, the impacts of therapeutic interventions, and patient compliance with rehabilitative programs. When coupled to remote medical monitoring services, these devices have the potential to dramatically impact patient outcomes by lessening the diagnostic dependence on symptom recognition and decreasing event response times. Significant cost savings may also be realized through more efficient use of specialist resources, reduction in the number of office visits to physicians, and long-term improvements in patient health. Structural and behavior barriers to adoption need to be addressed for these methods to reach their full potential, addressing patient privacy concerns, adequate reimbursement, and integration into standard care protocols.

N2  - The primary goal of the initial ECG evaluation of every wide complex tachycardia is  to determine whether the tachyarrhythmia has a ventricular or supraventricular origin. The answer to this question drives immediate patient care decisions, ensuing clinical workup, and long-term management strategies. Thus, the importance of arriving at the correct diagnosis cannot be understated and has naturally spurred rigorous research, which has brought forth an ever-expanding abundance of manually applied and automated methods to differentiate wide complex tachycardias. In this review, we provide an in-depth analysis of traditional and more contemporary methods to differentiate ventricular tachycardia and supraventricular wide complex tachycardia. In doing so, we: (1) review hallmark wide complex tachycardia differentiation criteria, (2) examine the conceptual and structural design of standard wide complex tachycardia differentiation methods, (3) discuss practical limitations of manually applied ECG interpretation approaches, and (4) highlight recently formulated methods designed to differentiate ventricular tachycardia and supraventricular wide complex tachycardia automatically.

N2  - RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effect of dual-bolus contrast media  injection (dual-CM) on the accuracy of automated right ventricular (RV) segmentation on coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 104 patients with suspected and known coronary artery disease underwent 256-slice CCTA with retrospective electrocardiographic (ECG) gating. The patients were divided into 51 patients who underwent single-bolus CM injection (single-CM) and 53 patients who underwent dual-CM. The dual-CM method consisted of an initial bolus of CM followed by an injection of dilute CM with saline (CM:saline, 1:9). Three-dimensional CCTA images were automatically segmented into the RV, left ventricle (LV), and myocardium using commercially available software (Comprehensive Cardiac Analysis; Philips Medical Systems, Cleveland, OH). Prevalence and locations of segmentation errors were compared between single-CM and dual-CM. Segmentation errors were defined as segment deviation of >1 cm from the actual ventricular margin. RESULTS: Prevalence of segmentation errors was significantly lower with dual-CM than with single-CM in the diastolic phase (4/41 vs. 20/41, respectively; P < .01), and there was no difference between the two methods in the systolic phase (2/12 vs. 2/10, respectively). With dual-CM and single-CM, the locations of segmentation errors were mostly the RV wall (4/53 and 18/51, respectively) and secondly the LV wall (2/53 and 9/51, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Dual-CM improved the accuracy of automated ventricular segmentation using diastolic data from 256-slice CCTA.

N2  - To assess agreement between two semi-automatic, three-dimensional (3D) computed  tomography (CT) ventricular volumetry methods with different user interactions in patients with congenital heart disease. In 30 patients with congenital heart disease (median age 8 years, range 5 days-33 years; 20 men), dual-source, multi-section, electrocardiography-synchronized cardiac CT was obtained at the end-systolic (n = 22) and/or end-diastolic (n = 28) phase. Nineteen left ventricle end-systolic (LV ESV), 28 left ventricle end-diastolic (LV EDV), 22 right ventricle end-systolic (RV ESV), and 28 right ventricle end-diastolic volumes (RV EDV) were successfully calculated using two semi-automatic, 3D segmentation methods with different user interactions (high in method 1, low in method 2). The calculated ventricular volumes of the two methods were compared and correlated. A P value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. LV ESV (35.95 ± 23.49 ml), LV EDV (88.76 ± 61.83 ml), and RV ESV (46.87 ± 47.39 ml) measured by method 2 were slightly but significantly smaller than those measured by method 1 (41.25 ± 26.94 ml, 92.20 ± 62.69 ml, 53.61 ± 50.08 ml for LV ESV, LV EDV, and RV ESV, respectively; P ≤ 0.02). In contrast, no statistically significant difference in RV EDV (122.57 ± 88.57 ml in method 1, 123.83 ± 89.89 ml in method 2; P = 0.36) was found between the two methods. All ventricular volumes showed very high correlation (R = 0.978, 0.993, 0.985, 0.997 for LV ESV, LV EDV, RV ESV, and RV EDV, respectively; P < 0.001) between the two methods. In patients with congenital heart disease, 3D CT ventricular volumetry shows good agreement and high correlation between the two methods, but method 2 tends to slightly underestimate LV ESV, LV EDV, and RV ESV.

N2  - Objective To evaluate the application of automated tube potential selection  technique in high-pitch dual-source CT aortic angiography on a third-generation dual-source CT scanner. Methods Whole aorta angiography were indiated in 59 patients,who were divided into 2 groups using a simple random method:in group 1 there were 31 patients who underwent the examination with automated tube potential selection using a vascular setting with a preferred image quality of 288 mA/100 kV;in group 2 there were 28 patients who underwent the examination with a tube voltage of 100 kV and automated tube current modulation using a reference tube current of 288 mA. Both groups were scanned on a third generation dual-source CT device operated in dual-source high-pitch ECG-gating mode with a pitch of 3.0,collimation of 2×192×0.6 mm,and a rotation time of 0.25 s. Iterative reconstruction algorithm was used. For group 1,the volume and flow of contrast medium and chasing saline were adapted to the tube voltage. For group 2,a contrast material bolus of 45 ml with a flow of 4.5 ml/s followed by a 50 ml saline chaser at 5 ml/s was used. CTA scan was automatically started using a bolus tracking technique at the level of the original part of aorta after a trigger threshold of 100 HU was reached. The start delay was set to 6 s in both groups. Effective dose (ED),signal to noise ratio (SNR),contrast to noise ratio (CNR),and subjective diagnostic quality of both groups were evaluated. Results The mean ED were 21.3% lower (t=-3.099,P=0.000) in group 1 [(2.48±0.80) mSv] than in group 2 [(3.15±0.86) mSv]. Two groups showed no significant difference in attenuation,SD,SNR,or CNR at all evaluational parts of aorta (ascending aorta,aortic arch,diaphragmatic aorta,or iliac bifurcation)(all P>0.05). There was no significant difference in subjective diagnostic quality values of two groups [(1.41±0.50) scores vs. (1.39±0.50) scores;W=828.5,P=0.837]. Conclusion Compared with automated tube current modulation,the automated tube potential selection technique in aorta CT angiography on a third-generation dual-source CT can dramatically reduce radiation dose without affecting image quality.

N2  - This report describes a form of group beating induced by a St Jude dual chamber ICD  which interpreted a ventricular escape rhythm (with retrograde conduction) as premature ventricular complexes (PVC). These pacemaker-defined PVCs activated the atrial pace-PVC algorithm in 2 steps. 1. The postventricular atrial refractory period (PVARP) was terminated upon detecting a retrograde P wave within its unblanked portion, and 2. An atrial stimulus was released 330ms after the end of the PVARP. This response resulted in automatic mode switching because the 330ms interatrial interval was shorter than the atrial tachycardia detection interval. The arrhythmia may be considered to represent an unusual form of pacemaker escape-capture bigeminy.

N2  - AIM: To assess the effect of two iterative reconstruction algorithms (AIDR and  AIDR3D) and individualized automatic tube current selection on radiation dose and image quality in computed tomography coronary angiography (CTCA). MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a single-centre cohort study, 942 patients underwent electrocardiogram-gated CTCA using a 320-multidetector CT system. Images from group 1 (n = 228) were reconstructed with a filtered back projection algorithm (Quantum Denoising Software, QDS+). Iterative reconstruction was used for group 2 (AIDR, n = 379) and group 3 (AIDR3D, n = 335). Tube current was selected based on body mass index (BMI) for groups 1 and 2, and selected automatically based on scout image attenuation for group 3. Subjective image quality was graded on a four-point scale (1 = excellent, 4 = non-diagnostic). RESULTS: There were no differences in age (p = 0.975), body mass index (p = 0.435), or heart rate (p = 0.746) between the groups. Image quality improved with iterative reconstruction and automatic tube current selection [1.3 (95% confidence intervals (CI): 1.2-1.4), 1.2 (1.1-1.2) and 1.1 (1-1.2) respectively; p < 0.001] and radiation dose decreased [274 (260-290), 242 (230-253) and 168 (156-180) mGy cm, respectively; p < 0.001]. CONCLUSION: The application of the latest iterative reconstruction algorithm and individualized automatic tube current selection can substantially reduce radiation dose whilst improving image quality in CTCA.

N2  - AIMS: Transthoracic murine echocardiography is a cornerstone of small animal  research, but conventional methods cannot detect regional perturbations in cardiac function. Reliable assessment of regional cardiac function would be of value in transgenic models of myocardial disease. Until now automatized algorithms for achieving this suffers from a number of drawbacks. We developed a simple algorithm for rapidly assessing the relative myocardial radial thickening that occurs between end-diastole and end-systole, that is, regional radial transmural end-systolic strain (RTESS). METHODS AND RESULTS: Echocardiographic assessment was performed in mice at baseline (n = 8), 2 hours postintraperitoneal isoprenaline (ISO) injection (n = 8), and 10 days postmyocardial infarction (post-MI) (n = 6). A >1000 frames/sec cine loop was acquired by the ECG-gated Kilohertz visualization technique in the parasternal short-axis projection at 3 mm below the mitral annulus. Endo- and epicardial borders were traced at end-diastole and end-systole and RTESS was calculated for each of n segments by the algorithm. The intra- and inter-observer coefficients of variation for segmental RTESS assessment were 5.11 and 7.32, respectively. At baseline, average segmental RTESS was 56.75% and RTESS was similar in all cardiac segments regardless of how many segments the heart was divided into. In the akinetic myocardium of MI and ISO mice, 47.36% and 26.22% length of the endocardium, respectively, RTESS was near zero and significantly different from the remaining myocardium. CONCLUSION: We describe a simple and straightforward approach to quantify regional myocardial deformation in mouse models of cardiovascular disease.

N2  - PURPOSE: Compare the right ventricle to left ventricle (RV/LV) diameter ratio  obtained from axial pulmonary CT angiograms (CTPA) with those derived from automatically generated 4-chamber (4-CH) reformats in patients with suspected pulmonary embolism (PE). METHODS: In this institutional review board-approved study we included 120 consecutive non ECG-gated CTPA from 3 institutions (mean age 60 ± 16 years; 71 women). Twenty 64-slice CTPA with PE and 20 without PE were selected per institution. For each patient the RV/LV diameter ratio was obtained from both axial CTPA images and automatically generated 4-CH reformats. Measurements were performed twice in two separated sessions by 2 experienced radiologists and 2 residents. The differences between the measurements on both views were evaluated. RESULTS: The 4-CH view was successfully obtained in 113 patients. The mean axial and 4-CH diameter ratios were comparable for three of the four readers (p = 0.56, p = 0.13, p = 0.08). Although the mean diameters (1.0 and 1.03 respectively) for one resident were significantly different (p = 0.013), the difference of 0.03 seems negligible in clinical routine. Three readers achieved equally high intra-reader agreements with both measurements (ICCs of 0.94, 0.95 and 0.96), while one reader showed a different variability with ICCs of 0.96 for the axial view and 0.91 for the 4-CH view. The inter-reader agreement was equally high for both measurement types with ICCs of 0.95 and 0.94, respectively. CONCLUSION: In patients with suspected PE, RV/LV diameters ratio can be measured with the same reproducibility and accuracy using an automatically generated 4-CH view compared to the axial view.

N2  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the performance of a low-b-value diffusion-weighted (DW)  echo-planar (EP) imaging sequence for detection of regional and diffuse myocardial edema in patients with acute myocarditis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was approved by the institutional review board, and informed consent was obtained from all subjects. Thirteen patients with acute myocarditis and a control group of seven healthy adults underwent low-b-value (50 sec/mm(2)) DW cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. DW EP images were acquired in the four-chamber long-axis section and analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively. Short inversion time inversion-recovery (STIR) T2-weighted and late gadolinium chelate enhancement images were acquired in the same plane and analyzed. Late gadolinium chelate enhancement was used as the reference standard. Statistical analyses were performed with a receiver operating characteristic analysis and a nonparametric Wilcoxon test. RESULTS: Qualitative analysis showed myocardial high-signal-intensity areas in 100% (13 of 13) of patients on DW EP, 38% (five of 13) on STIR T2-weighted, and 100% (13 of 13) on late gadolinium chelate enhancement images. In eight patients (61%), high-signal-intensity areas were exhibited on DW EP images that were not detected on STIR T2-weighted images, but were colocalized with lesions detected on late gadolinium chelate enhancement images. Similar results were obtained by using an automatic analysis with dedicated cardiac software. The global myocardial signal intensity ratio was significantly higher (P = .03) in patients than in controls for DW EP (2.2 ± 0.4 [standard deviation] vs 1.1 ± 0.4, respectively), and exhibited no significant difference (P = .14) for STIR T2-weighted (1.7 ± 0.6 vs 1.4 ± 0.1, respectively) images. Sensitivity and diagnostic accuracy were higher for DW EP images than for STIR T2-weighted images (92% vs 54%, and 95% vs 70%, respectively), and specificity was the same (100% vs 100%). CONCLUSION: A low-b-value DW EP imaging sequence is a feasible alternative to the standard STIR T2-weighted sequence for detection of regional and global myocardium edema in patients with acute myocarditis.

N2  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of automated  best R-R interval determination software for the evaluation of dual-source coronary multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) angiography. METHODS: One hundred and nine consecutive patients who underwent dual-source coronary MDCT angiography are included in the study. The indications were chest pain syndrome of low-intermediate risk and/or nonspecific electrocardiographic changes (n = 91), stenting (n = 9), and bypass grafts (n = 9). Imaging was performed using dual-source MDCT. Temporal resolution was 0.83 milliseconds and slice thickness was 0.6 mm. None of the patients received β-blockers. Best R-R interval software has determined the best intervals in diastole and systole. The visibility of coronary arteries was evaluated using 15-segment (total 1635 segments) AHA classification by 2 radiologists in consensus. RESULTS: The mean patient age was 55 years. The mean heart rate was 73 beats per minute (range, 47-110 beats per minute). The mean (SD) best diastole R-R interval was determined as 73 (5) (95% CI, 63-83), and the mean (SD) best systole interval as 38 (5) (95% CI, 28-48). When only best diastole, only best systole, and both best systole and diastole reconstructions were evaluated, all coronary artery segments were visualized in 65 (60%), 61 (56%), and 93 (85%) patients, respectively. In 12 patients' evaluation of additional 1(n = 11) or 2(n = 1), R-R reconstruction intervals allowed visualization of all coronary artery segments. In 4 patients with arrhythmia, all segments cannot be visualized, but after electrocardiographic editing, all segments were visible in 3 of 4 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Automatic determination of best R-R reconstruction interval allows evaluation of all coronary artery segments in most patients (85%) without additional reconstructions. By means of this software, coronary CT angiography studies can be evaluated faster and easier. The most significant limitation of the software is patients with arrhythmia.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The Japanese diagnostic assessment of nuclear cardiology has usually  been based on semi-quantitative visual analyses but not on automated quantification with a total perfusion deficit (TPD). We, therefore, aimed to determine whether automated TPD quantification is useful to detect coronary artery disease (CAD) in Japanese patients in comparison with conventional visual segmental analysis, and to compare results from the automated assessment between the Japanese and American normal databases (NDBs). METHODS: Patients with suspected CAD underwent rest (201)Tl and stress (99m)Tc-tetrofosmin myocardial perfusion single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and coronary angiography within three months. The TPD was automatically derived from the SPECT image through quantitative perfusion SPECT software with the Japanese and American NDBs. The visual summed stress scores (SSS) were estimated with the 5-point visual scoring model for 20 segments of SPECT images. An abnormal criteria for the stress TPD and SSS were defined as ≥ 5% and ≥ 4, respectively. RESULTS: Detection sensitivity of CAD was 87% with the stress TPD score derived from the Japanese NDB and 85% with the SSS in visual analysis. In contrast, the detection sensitivity with the stress TPD score derived from the American NDB was 75%, which was significantly lower than that with the Japanese TPD (p=0.0004). Specificity of the automated Japanese TPD assessment was similar to that of the visual SSS assessment (87% vs. 80%). Thus, sensitivity and specificity of the automated quantitative assessment based on the TPD scores derived from the Japanese NDB were consistent with that of visual quantification based on the segmental defect scores. CONCLUSION: The automated quantitative assessment with the Japanese NDB is useful for the detection of CAD when experts in visual interpretation of a myocardial perfusion SPECT image were absent in a clinical setting.

N2  - Implantable cardioverter defibrillators can generate numerous alerts. Automatically  classifying these alerts according to their severity hinges on the CHA2DS2VASc score. It requires some reasoning capabilities for interpreting the patient's data. We compared two approaches for implementing the reasoning module. One is based on the Drools engine, and the other is based on semantic web formalisms. Both were valid approaches with correct performances. For a broader domain, their limitations are the number and complexity of Drools rules and the performances of ontology-based reasoning, which suggests using the ontology for automatically generating a part of the Drools rules.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To develop an automatic algorithm to detect strict left bundle branch  block (LBBB) on electrocardiograms (ECG) and propose a procedure to test the consistency of neural network detections. APPROACH: The database for the classification of strict LBBB was provided by Telemetric and Holter ECG Warehouse. It contained 10 s ECGs taken from the MADIT-CRT clinical trial. The database was divided into a training dataset (N  =  300, strict LBBB  =  174, non-strict LBBB  =  126) and a test dataset (N  =  302, strict LBBB  =  156, non-strict LBBB  =  146). LBBB-related features were extracted by Philips DXL(™) algorithm, selected by a random forest classifier, and fed into a 5-layer neural network (NN) for the classification of strict LBBB on the training dataset. The performance of NN on the test dataset was compared to two random forest classifiers, an algorithm applying strict LBBB criteria, a wavelet-based approach, and a support-vector-machine approach. The consistency of NN's detection was tested on 549 2 min recordings of the PTB diagnostic ECG database. LBBB annotations are not required to measure consistency. MAIN RESULTS: The performance of NN on the test dataset were sensitivity  =  91. 7%, specificity  =  85.6% and accuracy  =  88.7% (PPV  =  87.2%, NPV  =  90.6%). The consistency score of strict-LBBB and non-strict-LBBB detection was 0.9341 and 0.9973 respectively. CONCLUSION: NN achieved the highest specificity, accuracy, and PPV. Using random forest for feature selection and NN for classification increased interpretability and reduced computational cost. The consistency test showed that NN achieved high consistency scores in the detection of strict LBBB. SIGNIFICANCE: This work proposed an approach for selecting features and training NN for the detection of strict LBBB as well as a consistency test for black-box algorithms.

N2  - Biomedical time series clustering that automatically groups a collection of time  series according to their internal similarity is of importance for medical record management and inspection such as bio-signals archiving and retrieval. In this paper, a novel framework that automatically groups a set of unlabelled multichannel biomedical time series according to their internal structural similarity is proposed. Specifically, we treat a multichannel biomedical time series as a document and extract local segments from the time series as words. We extend a topic model, i.e., the Hierarchical probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (H-pLSA), which was originally developed for visual motion analysis to cluster a set of unlabelled multichannel time series. The H-pLSA models each channel of the multichannel time series using a local pLSA in the first layer. The topics learned in the local pLSA are then fed to a global pLSA in the second layer to discover the categories of multichannel time series. Experiments on a dataset extracted from multichannel Electrocardiography (ECG) signals demonstrate that the proposed method performs better than previous state-of-the-art approaches and is relatively robust to the variations of parameters including length of local segments and dictionary size. Although the experimental evaluation used the multichannel ECG signals in a biometric scenario, the proposed algorithm is a universal framework for multichannel biomedical time series clustering according to their structural similarity, which has many applications in biomedical time series management.

N2  - In echo-cardiac clinical computer-aided diagnosis, an important step is to  automatically classify echocardiography videos from different angles and different regions. We propose a kind of echocardiography video classification algorithm based on the dense trajectory and difference histograms of oriented gradients (DHOG). First, we use the dense grid method to describe feature characteristics in each frame of echocardiography sequence and then track these feature points by applying the dense optical flow. In order to overcome the influence of the rapid and irregular movement of echocardiography videos and get more robust tracking results, we also design a trajectory description algorithm which uses the derivative of the optical flow to obtain the motion trajectory information and associates the different characteristics (e.g., the trajectory shape, DHOG, HOF, and MBH) with embedded structural information of the spatiotemporal pyramid. To avoid "dimension disaster," we apply Fisher's vector to reduce the dimension of feature description followed by the SVM linear classifier to improve the final classification result. The average accuracy of echocardiography video classification is 77.12% for all eight viewpoints and 100% for three primary viewpoints.

N2  - Electrocardiographic Decision Support - Myocardial Ischaemia (EDS-MI) is a graphical  decision support for detection and localization of acute transmural ischaemia. A recent study indicated that EDS-MI performs well for detection of acute transmural ischaemia. However, its performance has not been tested in patients with non-ischaemic ST-deviation. We aimed to optimize the diagnostic accuracy of EDS-MI in patients with verified acute coronary occlusion as well as patients with non-ischaemic ST deviation and compare its performance with STEMI criteria. We studied 135 patients with non-ischaemic ST deviation (perimyocarditis, left ventricular hypertrophy, takotsubo cardiomyopathy and early repolarization) and 117 patients with acute coronary occlusion. In 63 ischaemic patients, the extent and location of the ischaemic area (myocardium at risk) was assessed by both cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging and EDS-MI. Sensitivity and specificity of ST elevation myocardial infarction criteria were 85% (95% confidence interval (CI) 77, 90) and 44% (95% CI 36, 53) respectively. Using EDS-MI, sensitivity and specificity increased to 92% (95% CI 85, 95) and 81% (95% CI 74, 87) respectively (p=0.035 and p<0.001). Agreement was strong (83%) between cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging and EDS-MI in localization of ischaemia. Mean myocardium at risk was 32% (± 10) by cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging and 33% (± 11) by EDS-MI when the estimated infarcted area according to Selvester QRS scoring was included in myocardium at risk estimation. In conclusion, EDS-MI increases diagnostic accuracy and may serve as an automatic decision support in the early management of patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome. The added clinical benefit in a non-selected clinical chest pain population needs to be assessed.

N2  - A previously asymptomatic young female with no previous medical or cardiac history  collapsed during indoor exercise. A portable automatic external defibrillator showed a shockable rhythm. She received multiple electrical shocks with return to normal sinus rhythm without ischaemic ECG changes. Her troponin level was mildly elevated. A transthoracic echocardiogram revealed moderately reduced left ventricular ejection fraction with global hypokinesis. During emergent coronary angiography, the left main coronary artery could not be found. The right coronary artery was normal with robust collaterals to the entire left coronary circulation extending to the left main coronary artery, but did not fill the ostium. Coronary CT angiogram confirmed nearly complete absence of the left main coronary artery ostium. A diagnosis of left main coronary artery atresia was made. Patient underwent successful two vessel coronary artery bypass grafting. She continues to do well 1 year postoperatively.

N2  - Abnormal ST segment is an important parameter for the diagnosis of myocardial  ischemia and other heart diseases. As most abnormal ST segments sustain for only a few seconds, it is impractical for the doctors to detect and classify abnormal ones manually on time. Even though many ST segment classification algorithms are proposed to meet the rising demand of automatic myocardial ischemia diagnosis, they are often with lower recognition rate. The aim of this study is to detect abnormal ST segments precisely and classify them into more categories, and thus provide more detailed category information to help the clinicians make decisions. This study sums up ten common abnormal ST segments according to the clinical ECG records and proposes a morphological classification algorithm of ST segment based on multi-features. This algorithm consists of two parts: Feature points extraction and ST segment classification. In the first part, R wave is detected by using the 2B-spline wavelet transform, and mode-filtering method and morphological characteristics are used for other feature points extraction. In the ST segment classification process, ST segment level, variance, slope value, number of convex/concave points and other feature parameters are employed to classify the ST segment. This algorithm can classify abnormal ST segments into ten categories above. We evaluated the performance of the proposed algorithm based on ECG data in the European ST-T database. The global recognition rate of 92.7% and the best accuracy of 97% demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed solution.

N2  - The heart muscle pumps blood to vital organs, which is indispensable for human life.  Congestive heart failure (CHF) is characterized by the inability of the heart to pump blood adequately throughout the body without an increase in intracardiac pressure. The symptoms include lung and peripheral congestion, leading to breathing difficulty and swollen limbs, dizziness from reduced delivery of blood to the brain, as well as arrhythmia. Coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, and medical co-morbidities such as kidney disease, diabetes, and high blood pressure all take a toll on the heart and can impair myocardial function. CHF prevalence is growing worldwide. It afflicts millions of people globally, and is a leading cause of death. Hence, proper diagnosis, monitoring and management are imperative. The importance of an objective CHF diagnostic tool cannot be overemphasized. Standard diagnostic tests for CHF include chest X-ray, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), nuclear imaging, echocardiography, and invasive angiography. However, these methods are costly, time-consuming, and they can be operator-dependent. Electrocardiography (ECG) is inexpensive and widely accessible, but ECG changes are typically not specific for CHF diagnosis. A properly designed computer-aided detection (CAD) system for CHF, based on the ECG, would potentially reduce subjectivity and provide quantitative assessment for informed decision-making. Herein, we review existing CAD for automatic CHF diagnosis, and highlight the development of an ECG-based CAD diagnostic system that employs deep learning algorithms to automatically detect CHF.

N2  - Long QT syndrome (LQTS) is a genetic or acquired condition characterised by a  prolonged QT interval on the surface electrocardiogram (ECG) and is associated with a high risk of sudden cardiac death because of polymorph ventricular tachyarrhythmia called Torsade de Pointes arrhythmia. Drug-induced LQTS can occur as a side effect of commonly used cardiac and non-cardiac drugs in predisposed patients, often with baseline QT prolongation lengthened by medication and/or electrolyte disturbances. Hospitalised patients often have several risk factors for proarrhythmic response, such as advanced age and structural heart disease. Patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) are particularly prone to develop drug induced LQTS because they receive several different intravenous medications. Additionally, they might have impaired drug elimination because of reduced kidney and/or liver function, and also drug-drug-interactions. The clinical symptoms and signs of LQTS range from asymptomatic patients to sudden death because of malignant arrhythmias, and it is therefore important to recognise the clinical characteristics and typical ECG changes. Treatment of acquired LQTS is mainly awareness, identification and discontinuation of QT prolonging drugs, in addition to eventually supplement of magnesium and potassium. Overdrive cardiac pacing is highly effective in preventing recurrences, and antiarrhythmic drugs should be avoided. Recent data suggest that QT prolongation is quite common in ICU patients and adversely affects patient mortality. Thus, high-risk patients should be sufficiently monitored, and the use of medications known to cause drug-induced LQTS might have to be restricted.

N2  - The Transvalvular Impedance (TVI) is derived between atrial and ventricular pacing  electrodes. A sharp TVI increase in systole is an ejection marker, allowing the hemodynamic surveillance of ventricular stimulation effectiveness in pacemaker patients. At routine follow-up checks, the ventricular threshold test was managed by the stimulator with the supervision of a physician, who monitored the surface ECG. When the energy scan resulted in capture loss, the TVI system must detect the failure and increase the output voltage. A TVI signal suitable to this purpose was present in 85% of the tested patients. A total of 230 capture failures, induced in 115 patients in both supine and sitting upright positions, were all promptly recognized by real-time TVI analysis (100% sensitivity). The procedure was never interrupted by the physician, as the automatic energy regulation ensured full patient's safety. The pulse energy was then set at 4 times the threshold to test the alarm specificity during daily activity (sitting, standing up, and walking). The median prevalence of false alarms was 0.336%. The study shows that TVI-based ejection assessment is a valuable approach to the verification of pacing reliability and the autoregulation of ventricular stimulation energy.

N2  - BACKGROUND: This first-in-human volunteer phase I clinical trial aimed to evaluate  the safety, tolerability, and anesthesia efficacy of emulsified isoflurane (EI), an intravenously injectable formulation of isoflurane. METHODS: Seventy-eight healthy volunteers were recruited in this open-label, single-bolus, dose-escalation, phase I trial and were allocated into 16 cohorts. Each volunteer received a single bolus injection of EI. The dose started with 0.3 mg/kg (for isoflurane) and was planned to end with 64.6 mg/kg. Postdose vital signs, physical examination, laboratory tests, chest radiograph, 12-lead electrocardiogram, and development of any adverse event were closely monitored as safety measurements. Effectiveness in producing sedation/anesthesia was assessed by Modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation and Bispectral Index. RESULTS: The dose escalation ended as planned. The most common adverse events associated with EI were injection pain (77 of 78, 98.7%) and transient tachycardia (22 of 78, 25.6%). Only at high doses (≥38.3 mg/kg) did EI cause transient hypotension (5 of 78, 6.4%) or apnea (11 of 78, 14.1%), but all the affected volunteers recovered uneventfully. Fast onset of unconsciousness (typically 40 s after injection) was developed in all volunteers receiving doses of 22.6 mg/kg or greater. Waking-up time and depression in Modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation correlated well with EI dose. None of the postdose tests revealed any abnormal result. CONCLUSIONS: EI is safe for intravenous injection in human volunteers in the dose range of 0.3 to 64.6 mg/kg. At doses of 22.6 mg/kg or higher, EI produced rapid onset of unconsciousness in all volunteers followed by fast, predictable, and complete recovery.

N2  - Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common disorder which can cause periodic  fluctuations in heart rate. To diagnose sleep apnea, some studies analyze electrocardiogram (ECG) signals by adopting chaos-based analysis. This research is going to specifically focus on whether it is possible to use chaos-based analysis of heart rate variability (HRV) signals rather than using chaotic analysis of ECG signals to diagnose OSA. While conventional studies mostly use chaos-based analysis of ECG signals to detect OSA, here, we apply correlation dimension (CD) as a chaotic index to analyze HRV data in OSA patients. For this purpose, 17 patients with OSA and 9 healthy individuals referred to a sleep clinic in Isfahan/Iran are studied, and their HRV time series were extracted from 1-h ECG signals recorded overnight. The preliminary step to calculate CD is phase-space reconstruction of the system based on HRV time series. Corresponding parameters, including embedding dimension and lag time, are estimated optimally using enhanced related methods, and then CD is calculated using Grassberger-Procaccia algorithm. Moreover, to evaluate our results, detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA), one of the well-known nonlinear methods in HRV analysis to detect OSA, is also applied to our data and the result is compared with those obtained from CD analysis of HRV. CD index with P < 0.005 indicates a significant difference in nonlinear dynamics of HRV signals detected from OSA patients and healthy individuals.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a normal cardiac troponin I (cTnI) concentration and  normal ECG on entry rule out the development of a clinically significant cardiac arrhythmia (CSCA, defined as an arrhythmia requiring anti-arrhythmic treatment) in dogs that have sustained blunt trauma. DESIGN: Prospective, observational study. Client-owned dogs were enrolled between January 2015 and November 2016. SETTING: University teaching hospital. ANIMALS: Forty-seven client-owned dogs with a history of witnessed or suspected blunt trauma within 24 hours prior to presentation to the hospital. INTERVENTIONS: On admission to the emergency service, dogs had a standard 3-lead ECG and cTnI concentration (using a veterinary point-of-care device(*) ) performed. Animal Trauma Triage (ATT) scores, Modified Glasgow Coma Scale (MGCS), and the details regarding the nature and timing of the injury were recorded. The patients were monitored in the ICU for a minimum of 24 hours on continuous ECG telemetry. Cardiac rhythm was monitored every hour, and any abnormalities were noted. The need for anti-arrhythmic therapy was recorded. There were no treatment interventions. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Five of 47 dogs (10.6%) developed a CSCA during hospitalization after sustaining blunt trauma. A normal entry ECG and normal cardiac troponin concentration on entry had a 100% negative predictive value (NPV) for ruling out the development of a CSCA, although a normal cardiac troponin concentration alone also had an NPV of 100%. A normal entry ECG had an NPV of 95.3%. The prognosis for survival to discharge was 89.4% in this study population (42/47 dogs). CONCLUSIONS: In dogs with blunt trauma, an entry cTnI concentration or a combination of cTnI and ECG on entry may be useful in determining which patients are at a higher risk for the development of CSCA during the first 12 to 24 hours after the trauma.

N2  - Hot flashes (HF) are intense, transient feelings of heat usually accompanied with  flushed skin and sweating that are experienced by women around the time of menopause. HFs are associated with poor quality of life and increased cardiovascular risk. Automatic detection of HF occurrence and precise timing of HF onset could provide unique insight into the physiology of the HF and its effect on the cardiovascular system. A novel automatic algorithm is proposed for the detection of HFs occurrence and timing from the sternal skin conductance signal that is robust to noise and artifacts. The method is based on the gold standard rule (2μS rise in skin conductance within 30 s) and considers several conditions based on the skin conductance level and its derivative to reject unwanted events. ECG-derived heart rate pattern variations are studied prior to the detected HF onset. The algorithm is validated against expert detected HFs over 200 hours of sleep data collected from 12 perimenopausal women. It achieved a total accuracy of 93% and a total error of 3% in HF detection. It was observed that heart rate increased before the onset of 80% of the HFs occurring in undisturbed sleep. Application of this algorithm along with fusion of other simultaneously recorded physiological measures has the potential to advance understanding of the HF.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Autonomic dysfunctions occur during but also in between seizures. During  seizures, the direct involvement of central autonomic control centers cause specific changes in heart rate and respiration. The pathophysiology of autonomic dysfunctions that are observed in the interictal period is more difficult to explain. These alterations are most likely due to changes in the epileptic network and/or to a lesser extent due to direct interictal spike activity disturbing central autonomic centers. The aim of our study is to investigate whether ictal and interictal respiratory changes do occur in temporal lobe and absence epilepsy in children. We hypothesize that the interictal autonomic changes are due to changes in the neuronal network, by studying epilepsy patients with normal interictal background EEG. METHODS: Ictal and interictal single-lead ECG signals were extracted from 24h video-EEG recordings in 10 children with refractory temporal lobe seizures, in 10 children with absence seizures with occasional interictal discharges and 10 control subjects. RR interval time series were calculated and respiration parameters were derived from the ECG signal. ECG-derived respiration (EDR) signals were computed and time and frequency domain parameters were extracted to characterize the respiratory function. RESULTS: In the ictal registrations we observed bradypnea in 10 out of the 12 recorded seizures from the temporal lobe. In absence seizures, we observed a variable ictal effect on respiratory rate. In the analysis of the interictal data, the most remarkable finding was the higher power in the low frequency band and lower power in the high frequency band of the EDR signals in patients with absence seizures compared to control subjects, indicating a shift of respiratory rate to the lower frequencies. CONCLUSION: In conclusion we found a uniform pattern in ictal respiratory changes in temporal lobe seizures, due to direct involvement of central respiratory centers. In absence epilepsy, we found a disturbed respiratory control in between seizures. These changes were not present in the patients with temporal lobe epilepsy. The observed interictal changes in respiration in absence epilepsy are most likely due to epileptogenetic changes in the thalamocortical network, involved in absence epilepsy and could not be explained by interictal spike activity.

N2  - An important tool in early diagnosis of cardiac dysfunctions is the analysis of  electrocardiograms (ECGs) obtained from ambulatory long-term recordings. Heart rate variability (HRV) analysis became a significant tool for assessing the cardiac health. The usefulness of HRV assessment for the prediction of cardiovascular events in end-stage renal disease patients was previously reported. The aim of this work is to verify an enhanced algorithm to obtain an RR-interval time series in a fully automated manner. The multi-lead corrected R-peaks of each ECG lead are used for RR-series computation and the algorithm is verified by a comparison with manually reviewed reference RR-time series. Twenty-four hour 12-lead ECG recordings of 339 end-stage renal disease patients from the ISAR (rISk strAtification in end-stage Renal disease) study were used. Seven universal indicators were calculated to allow for a generalization of the comparison results. The median score of the indicator of synchronization, i.e. intraclass correlation coefficient, was 96.4% and the median of the root mean square error of the difference time series was 7.5 ms. The negligible error and high synchronization rate indicate high similarity and verified the agreement between the fully automated RR-interval series calculated with the AIT Multi-Lead ECGsolver and the reference time series. As a future perspective, HRV parameters calculated on this RR-time series can be evaluated in longitudinal studies to ensure clinical benefit.

N2  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Ambulatory based healthcare system use limited electrodes  for electroencephalogram (EEG) acquisition at concerned electrode position, to minimize the instrumentation and computational complexity. But, again the possibility of contamination is inevitable depending on the electrode position on the scalp. This paper proposes an electrocardiogram (ECG) artifact correction algorithm in the absence of coherent ECG for automatic analysis/diagnosis of the acquired contaminated single channel EEG signal. METHODS: The proposed algorithm uses an enhanced and modified version of signal decomposition i.e. modified variational mode decomposition (mVMD) to obtain band limited intrinsic mode functions (BLIMFs) from EEG epoch. The mVMD is found to be useful when the signal contains properties that are correlated. Further, exploiting the correlation among the obtained mode functions the ECG artifact components are identified. An ECG reference is estimated and QRS complexes are suppressed. The effective EEG reconstruction is performed by simply adding the remaining BLIMFs to QRS complex suppressed estimated reference. This is owing to the robust reconstruction feature provided by mVMD. RESULTS: Upon the comparative evaluation for both real and semi-simulated dataset, the proposed algorithm is providing less distortion to the EEG brain activity frequency bands, and is also less computationally intensive than the existing Ensembled empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) based algorithm that requires ECG reference channel. Evaluation of semi-simulated dataset obtained an average correlation of 97% between EEG signals before contamination and after correction of ECG artifact. CONCLUSION: The proposed algorithm efficiently corrects the ECG artifact from EEG while overcoming the limitations such as, (1) requirement of a reference ECG channel, (2) requirement of R-R interval or amplitude thresholding for QRS complex identification.

N2  - This study was to assess the feasibility of using non-standardized single-lead  electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring to automatically detect atrial fibrillation (AF) with special emphasis on the combination of deep learning based algorithm and modified patch-based ECG lead. Fifty-five consecutive patients were monitored for AF in around 24 hours by patch-based ECG devices along with a standard 12-lead Holter. Catering to potential positional variability of patch lead, four typical positions on the upper-left chest were proposed. For each patch lead, the performance of automated algorithms with four different convolutional neural networks (CNN) was evaluated for AF detection against blinded annotations of two clinicians. A total of 349,388 10-second segments of AF and 161,084 segments of sinus rhythm were detected successfully. Good agreement between patch-based single-lead and standard 12-lead recordings was obtained at the position MP1 that corresponds to modified lead II, and a promising performance of the automated algorithm with an R-R intervals based CNN model was achieved on this lead in terms of accuracy (93.1%), sensitivity (93.1%), and specificity (93.4%). The present results suggest that the optimized patch-based ECG lead along by deep learning based algorithms may offer the possibility of providing an accurate, easy, and inexpensive clinical tool for mass screening of AF.

N2  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Predictive monitoring is an exciting new field involving analysis  of physiologic data to detect abnormal patterns associated with critical illness. The first example of predictive monitoring being taken from inception (proof of concept) to reality (demonstration of improved outcomes) is the use of heart rate characteristics (HRC) monitoring to detect sepsis in infants in the neonatal ICU. The commercially available 'HeRO' monitor analyzes electrocardiogram data from existing bedside monitors for decreased HR variability and transient decelerations associated with sepsis, and converts these changes into a score (the HRC index or HeRO score). This score is the fold increase in probability that a patient will have a clinical deterioration from sepsis within 24 h. This review focuses on HRC monitoring and discusses future directions in predictive monitoring of ICU patients. RECENT FINDINGS: In a randomized trial of 3003 very low birthweight infants, display of the HeRO score reduced mortality more than 20%. Ongoing research aims to combine respiratory and HR analysis to optimize care of ICU patients. SUMMARY: Predictive monitoring has recently been shown to save lives. Harnessing and analyzing the vast amounts of physiologic data constantly displayed in ICU patients will lead to improved algorithms for early detection, prognosis, and therapy of critical illnesses.

N2  - Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of deaths worldwide. The rising  mortality rate can be reduced by early detection and treatment interventions. Clinically, electrocardiogram (ECG) signal provides useful information about the cardiac abnormalities and hence employed as a diagnostic modality for the detection of various CVDs. However, subtle changes in these time series indicate a particular disease. Therefore, it may be monotonous, time-consuming and stressful to inspect these ECG beats manually. In order to overcome this limitation of manual ECG signal analysis, this paper uses a novel discrete wavelet transform (DWT) method combined with nonlinear features for automated characterization of CVDs. ECG signals of normal, and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and myocardial infarction (MI) are subjected to five levels of DWT. Relative wavelet of four nonlinear features such as fuzzy entropy, sample entropy, fractal dimension and signal energy are extracted from the DWT coefficients. These features are fed to sequential forward selection (SFS) technique and then ranked using ReliefF method. Our proposed methodology achieved maximum classification accuracy (acc) of 99.27%, sensitivity (sen) of 99.74%, and specificity (spec) of 98.08% with K-nearest neighbor (kNN) classifier using 15 features ranked by the ReliefF method. Our proposed methodology can be used by clinical staff to make faster and accurate diagnosis of CVDs. Thus, the chances of survival can be significantly increased by early detection and treatment of CVDs.

N2  - This brief review is focused on 12-lead Holter electrocardiogram (ECG) recording  including a review of the literature and the description of the advantages of its application. The standard 12-lead ECG provides a bedside snapshot of the electrical activity of the heart including vector information, but a snapshot of a few beats for some seconds might miss the whole story. Traditional Holter ECG displaying two or three leads may record all heart beats during a prolonged period, but the limited vector information might be a cause of shortcomings in the ECG diagnosis. The 12-lead Holter ECG overcomes these disadvantages and should be preferred for detecting episodes of arrhythmias, localize their origin or the localization of myocardial ischemia. The 12-lead Holter ECG monitoring is efficient in the evaluation of the effect of drugs or interventional therapeutic procedures, i.e., efficiency of biventricular pacing in patients with heart failure and permanent atrial fibrillation (AF). The automatic analysis of parameters in 12-lead Holter ECG is also providing information for risk stratification. In order to obtain a precise diagnosis based on the criteria established on standard ECG, the "real" 12-lead ECG with ten electrodes is advocated.

N2  - Automatic processing and accurate diagnosis of pathological electrocardiogram (ECG)  signals remains a challenge. As long-term ECG recordings continue to increase in prevalence, driven partly by the ease of remote monitoring technology usage, the need to automate ECG analysis continues to grow. In previous studies, a model-based ECG filtering approach to ECG data from healthy subjects has been applied to facilitate accurate online filtering and analysis of physiological signals. We propose an extension of this approach, which models not only normal and ventricular heartbeats, but also morphologies not previously encountered. A switching Kalman filter approach is introduced to enable the automatic selection of the most likely mode (beat type), while simultaneously filtering the signal using appropriate prior knowledge. Novelty detection is also made possible by incorporating a third mode for the detection of unknown (not previously observed) morphologies, and denoted as X-factor. This new approach is compared to state-of-the-art techniques for the ventricular heartbeat classification in the MIT-BIH arrhythmia and Incart databases. F1 scores of 98.3% and 99.5% were found on each database, respectively, which are superior to other published algorithms' results reported on the same databases. Only 3% of all the beats were discarded as X-factor, and the majority of these beats contained high levels of noise. The proposed technique demonstrates accurate beat classification in the presence of previously unseen (and unlearned) morphologies and noise, and provides an automated method for morphological analysis of arbitrary (unknown) ECG leads.

N2  - PURPOSE: Increased resting muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) and lower  forearm blood flow (FBF) were observed in young men who use anabolic androgenic steroids (AAS). However, the response of MSNA and FBF in AAS users triggered by muscle mechanoreflex and central command has never been tested. In addition, we evaluated the blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) responses during these maneuvers. METHODS: Nineteen AAS users (AASU) 31 ± 6 yr of age and 18 AAS nonusers (AASNU) 29 ± 4 yr of age were recruited. All participants were involved in strength training. AAS use was determined using a urine test (liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry). MSNA was measured using the microneurography technique. FBF was measured by using venous occlusion plethysmography. BP was measured using an automatic oscillometric device. HR was recorded continuously through ECG. Isometric handgrip exercise was performed at 30% of the maximal voluntary contraction for 3 min, and mental stress was elicited by the Stroop color-word test for 4 min. RESULTS: The MSNA and FBF responses during exercise were similar between AASU and AASNU, with a trend toward higher MSNA (bursts per minute; P = 0.084) and lower forearm vascular conductance (FVC; units; P = 0.084) in AASU than in AASNU. During mental stress, AASU showed a significantly higher MSNA (P < 0.05) and lower FBF (P < 0.05) compared with AASNU. During both maneuvers, HR and BP increased linearly in both groups; however, AASU showed a significantly higher HR compared with AASNU. CONCLUSIONS: During muscle mechanoreflex activation (isometric exercise), AASU have normal MSNA and FBF responses, whereas during central command (mental stress) stimulation, AASU have exacerbated MSNA and blunted vasodilation. Therefore, mental stress seems to exacerbate neurovascular control throughout stress reaction situations in AASU.

N2  - AIMS: This study presents an automatic diagnostic method for the discrimination  between persistent and long-standing atrial fibrillation (AF) based on the surface electrocardiogram (ECG). METHODS AND RESULTS: Standard 12-lead ECG recordings were acquired in 53 patients with either persistent (N= 20) or long-standing AF (N= 33), the latter including both long-standing persistent and permanent AF. A combined frequency analysis of multiple ECG leads followed by the computation of standard complexity measures provided a method for the quantification of spatiotemporal AF organization. All possible pairs of precordial ECG leads were analysed by this method and resulting organization measures were used for automatic classification of persistent and long-standing AF signals. Correct classification rates of 84.9% were obtained, with a predictive value for long-standing AF of 93.1%. Spatiotemporal organization as measured in lateral precordial leads V5 and V6 was shown to be significantly lower during long-standing AF than persistent AF, suggesting that time-related alterations in left atrial electrical activity can be detected in the ECG. CONCLUSION: Accurate discrimination between persistent and long-standing AF based on standard surface recordings was demonstrated. This information could contribute to optimize the management of sustained AF, permitting appropriate therapeutic decisions and thereby providing substantial clinical cost savings.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Many technologies have been developed for minimally invasive monitoring  of cardiac output. Estimated continuous cardiac output (esCCO) measurement using pulse wave transit time is one noninvasive method. Because it does not require any additional sensors other than those for conducting 3 basic forms of monitoring (electrocardiogram, pulse oximeter wave, and noninvasive (or invasive) arterial blood pressure measurement), esCCO measurement is potentially useful in routine clinical circulatory monitoring for any patient including low-risk patients. We evaluated the efficacy of noninvasive esCCO using pulse wave transit time in this multicenter study. METHODS: We compared esCCO and intermittent bolus thermodilution cardiac output (TDCO) in 213 patients, 139 intensive care units (ICUs), and 74 operating rooms (ORs), at 7 participating institutions. We performed electrocardiogram, pulse oximetry, TDCO, and arterial blood pressure measurements in patients in ICUs and ORs; a single calibration was performed to measure esCCO continuously. TDCO measurement was performed once daily for ICU patients and every hour for OR patients, and just before the removal of the pulmonary arterial catheter from patients in both the ICU and OR. We evaluated esCCO against TDCO with correlation analysis and Bland and Altman analysis and also assessed the change of bias over time. Furthermore, we inspected the impact of change in systemic vascular resistance (SVR) on change in bias because abnormal SVR was assumed to be a factor contributing to the change of the bias. RESULTS: From among 588 esCCO and TDCO datasets (excluding calibration points), 587 datasets were analyzed for 213 patients. The analysis results show a correlation coefficient of 0.79 (P < 0.0001, 95% confidence limits of 0.756-0.819), a bias (mean difference between esCCO and TDCO) of 0.13 L/min (95% confidence interval of bias 0.04-0.22 L/min), and a precision (1 SD) of 1.15 L/min (95% prediction interval was -2.13 to 2.39 L/min). There were no significant differences among 3 defined time intervals over 48 hours after calibration (repeated-measures analysis of variance P = 0.781) in the ICU. The influence of SVR on esCCO analysis showed a correlation coefficient between SVR and an error of 0.37 (P < 0.0001, 95% confidence interval 0.298-0.438). CONCLUSION: The efficacy of noninvasive esCCO technology was compared with TDCO in 213 cases. Five hundred eighty-seven datasets comparing esCCO and TDCO showed close correlation and small bias and precision, which were comparable to current arterial waveform analysis technologies.

N2  - To improve data quality and save cost, clinical trials are nowadays performed using  electronic data capture systems (EDCS) providing electronic case report forms (eCRF) instead of paper-based CRFs. However, such EDCS are insufficiently integrated into the medical workflow and lack in interfacing with other study-related systems. In addition, most EDCS are unable to handle image and biosignal data, although electrocardiography (EGC, as example for one-dimensional (1D) data), ultrasound (2D data), or magnetic resonance imaging (3D data) have been established as surrogate endpoints in clinical trials. In this paper, an integrated workflow based on OpenClinica, one of the world's largest EDCS, is presented. Our approach consists of three components for (i) sharing of study metadata, (ii) integration of large volume data into eCRFs, and (iii) automatic image and biosignal analysis. In all components, metadata is transferred between systems using web services and JavaScript, and binary large objects (BLOBs) are sent via the secure file transfer protocol and hypertext transfer protocol. We applied the close-looped workflow in a multicenter study, where long term (7 days/24 h) Holter ECG monitoring is acquired on subjects with diabetes. Study metadata is automatically transferred into OpenClinica, the 4 GB BLOBs are seamlessly integrated into the eCRF, automatically processed, and the results of signal analysis are written back into the eCRF immediately.

N2  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Excessive cardiac monitor alarms lead to desensitization  and alarm fatigue. We created and implemented a standardized cardiac monitor care process (CMCP) on a 24-bed pediatric bone marrow transplant unit. The aim of this project was to decrease monitor alarms through the use of team-based standardized care and processes. METHODS: Using small tests of change, we developed and implemented a standardized CMCP that included: (1) a process for initial ordering of monitor parameters based on age-appropriate standards; (2) pain-free daily replacement of electrodes; (3) daily individualized assessment of cardiac monitor parameters; and (4) a reliable method for appropriate discontinuation of monitor. The Model for Improvement was used to design, test, and implement changes. The changes that were implemented after testing and adaptation were: family/patient engagement in the CMCP; creation of a monitor care log to address parameters, lead changes, and discontinuation; development of a pain-free process for electrode removal; and customized monitor delay and customized threshold parameters. RESULTS: From January to November 2013, percent compliance with each of the 4 components of the CMCP increased. Overall compliance with the CMCP increased from a median of 38% to 95%. During this time, the median number of alarms per patient-day decreased from 180 to 40. CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of the standardized CMCP resulted in a significant decrease in cardiac monitor alarms per patient day. We recommend a team-based approach to monitor care, including individualized assessment of monitor parameters, daily lead change, and proper discontinuation of the monitors.

N2  - Long-term electrocardiogram (ECG) has become one of the important diagnostic assist  methods in clinical cardiovascular domain. Long-term ECG is primarily used for the detection of various cardiovascular diseases that are caused by various cardiac arrhythmia such as myocardial infarction, cardiomyopathy, and myocarditis. In the past few years, the development of an automatic heartbeat classification method has been a challenge. With the accumulation of medical data, personalized heartbeat classification of a patient has become possible. For the long-term data accumulation method, such as the holter, it is difficult to obtain the analysis results in a short time using the original method of serial design. The pressure to develop a personalized automatic classification model is high. To solve these challenges, this paper implemented a parallel general regression neural network (GRNN) to classify the heartbeat, and achieved a 95% accuracy according to the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation. We designed an online learning program to form a personalized classification model for patients. The achieved accuracy of the model is 88% compared to the specific ECG data of the patients. The efficiency of the parallel GRNN with GTX780Ti can improve by 450 times.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: A variety of medications ranging from antiarrhythmics to  psychotropics, as well as conditions such as bradycardia, can prolong the QT interval, increasing the risk for life-threatening arrhythmias. Monitoring the corrected QT interval (QTc) is therefore critical for patient safety. The recent development of smart phone heart monitors (SHM) may allow for easier QTc monitoring. We sought to evaluate the accuracy of an SHM for assessing the QTc, as compared to the standard 12-lead ECG. METHODS AND RESULTS: We compared the QTc interval in lead-I and lead-II between an SHM and 12-lead ECG. Healthy volunteers and hospitalized patients in sinus rhythm being loaded on dofetilide or sotalol were included. Manual and automatic measurements were studied. Across 99 healthy volunteers, the SHM QTc demonstrated good agreement (bias = 4 milliseconds, standard deviation of bias = 11 milliseconds) compared to the 12-lead ECG, using the Bland-Altman method of agreement. Across all hospitalized patients, the SHM was capable of demonstrating QTc prolongation. Between the 12-lead ECG and SHM, lead-I measurements had reasonable agreement (bias = 3 milliseconds, standard deviation of bias = 46 milliseconds). A QTc of > 500 milliseconds was associated with a higher likelihood (OR = 12.0; 95% CI 1.5-111.4; P = 0.02) to not achieve perfect agreement. CONCLUSION: The SHM is accurate in measuring QTc interval in sinus rhythm when compared to 12-lead ECG in healthy volunteers. For patients receiving QT prolonging antiarrhythmics, SHM is capable of detecting QTc prolongation, and lead-I of the SHM is most accurate in measuring the QTc if < 500 milliseconds.

N2  - Arrhythmia constitutes a problem with the rate or rhythm of the heartbeat, and an  early diagnosis is essential for the timely inception of successful treatment. We have jointly optimized the entire multi-stage arrhythmia classification scheme based on 12-lead surface ECGs that attains the accuracy performance level of professional cardiologists. The new approach is comprised of a three-step noise reduction stage, a novel feature extraction method and an optimal classification model with finely tuned hyperparameters. We carried out an exhaustive study comparing thousands of competing classification algorithms that were trained on our proprietary, large and expertly labeled dataset consisting of 12-lead ECGs from 40,258 patients with four arrhythmia classes: atrial fibrillation, general supraventricular tachycardia, sinus bradycardia and sinus rhythm including sinus irregularity rhythm. Our results show that the optimal approach consisted of Low Band Pass filter, Robust LOESS, Non Local Means smoothing, a proprietary feature extraction method based on percentiles of the empirical distribution of ratios of interval lengths and magnitudes of peaks and valleys, and Extreme Gradient Boosting Tree classifier, achieved an F(1)-Score of 0.988 on patients without additional cardiac conditions. The same noise reduction and feature extraction methods combined with Gradient Boosting Tree classifier achieved an F(1)-Score of 0.97 on patients with additional cardiac conditions. Our method achieved the highest classification accuracy (average 10-fold cross-validation F(1)-Score of 0.992) using an external validation data, MIT-BIH arrhythmia database. The proposed optimal multi-stage arrhythmia classification approach can dramatically benefit automatic ECG data analysis by providing cardiologist level accuracy and robust compatibility with various ECG data sources.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Identification of atrial fibrillation (AF) is a clinical imperative.  Heartbeat interval time series are increasingly available from personal monitors, allowing new opportunity for AF diagnosis. GOAL: Previously, we devised numerical algorithms for identification of normal sinus rhythm (NSR), AF, and SR with frequent ectopy using dynamical measures of heart rate. Here, we wished to validate them in the canonical MIT-BIH ECG databases. METHODS: We tested algorithms on the NSR, AF and arrhythmia databases. RESULTS: When the databases were combined, the positive predictive value of the new algorithms exceeded 95% for NSR and AF, and was 40% for SR with ectopy. Further, dynamical measures did not distinguish atrial from ventricular ectopy. Inspection of individual 24hour records showed good correlation of observed and predicted rhythms. CONCLUSION: Heart rate dynamical measures are effective ingredients in numerical algorithms to classify cardiac rhythm from the heartbeat intervals time series alone.

N2  - The ECG has been much neglected in automatic seizure detection in the newborn.  Changes in heart rate and ECG rhythm are often found in animal and adult patients with seizure. However, little is known about heart rate variability (HRV) changes in human neonate during seizure. Results of ongoing time-frequency research are presented here with the aim to compare the performance of various time-frequency distributions (TFDs) when applied to HRV time series for non-seizure and seizure newborns. The TFDs studied are the Wigner-Ville (WVD), the Spectrogram (SP), the Choi-Williams (CWD) and the Modified B (MBD) distributions. Based on our preliminary results, our current conclusion is MBD outperforms other TFDs in terms of time-frequency resolution, cross-terms suppression and to represent the newborn HRV signals of non-seizure and seizure which are closely-spaced components in the time-frequency domain.

N2  - Pulse oximetry has been extensively used to estimate oxygen saturation in blood, a  vital physiological parameter commonly used when monitoring a subject's health status. However, accurate estimation of this parameter is difficult to achieve when the fundamental signal from which it is derived, the photoplethysmograph (PPG), is contaminated with noise artifact induced by movement of the subject or the measurement apparatus. This study presents a novel method for automatic rejection of artifact contaminated pulse oximetry waveforms, based on waveform morphology analysis. The performance of the proposed algorithm is compared to a manually annotated gold standard. The creation of the gold standard involved two experts identifying sections of the PPG signal containing good quality PPG pulses and/or noise, in 104 fingertip PPG signals, using a simultaneous electrocardiograph (ECG) signal as a reference signal. The fingertip PPG signals were each 1 min in duration and were acquired from 13 healthy subjects (10 males and 3 females). Each signal contained approximately 20 s of purposely induced artifact noise from a variety of activities involving subject movement. Some unique waveform morphology features were extracted from the PPG signals, which were believed to be correlated with signal quality. A simple decision-tree classifier was employed to arrive at a classification decision, at a pulse-by-pulse resolution, of whether a pulse was of acceptable quality for use or not. The performance of the algorithm was assessed using Cohen's kappa coefficient (κ), sensitivity, specificity and accuracy measures. A mean κ of 0.64 ± 0.22 was obtained, while the mean sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were 89 ± 10%, 77 ± 19% and 83 ± 11%, respectively. Furthermore, a heart rate estimate, extracted from uncontaminated sections of PPG, as identified by the algorithm, was compared with the heart rate derived from an uncontaminated simultaneous ECG signal. The mean error between both heart rate readings was 0.49 ± 0.66 beats per minute (BPM), in comparison to an error value observed without using the artifact detection algorithm of 7.23 ± 5.78 BPM. These results demonstrate that automated identification of signal artifact in the PPG signal through waveform morphology analysis is achievable. In addition, a clear improvement in the accuracy of the derived heart rate is also evident when such methods are employed.

N2  - In diagnosis of brain death for human organ transplant, EEG (electroencephalogram)  must be flat to conclude the patient's brain death but it has been reported that the flat EEG test is sometimes difficult due to artifacts such as the contamination from the power supply and ECG (electrocardiogram, the signal from the heartbeat). ICA (independent component analysis) is an effective signal processing method that can separate such artifacts from the EEG signals. Applying ICA to EEG channels, we obtain several separated components among which some correspond to the brain activities while others contain artifacts. This paper aims at automatic selection of the separated components based on time series analysis. In the flat EEG test in brain death diagnosis, such automatic component selection is helpful.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Asymptomatic atrial fibrillation [AF] is an important cause of fatal or  disabling stroke. A continuous heart-rate monitoring device, comfortable enough to be worn continuously and reliable enough to detect AF, would allow for prompt initiation of anticoagulation therapy to prevent stroke. METHODS: We studied a new custom-made wearable photo-plethysmograph [PPG] wrist-watch sensor, specifically designed for continuous heart rate monitoring and incorporating contact and motion noise-filters. We tested its ability to automatically detect AF in patients undergoing elective cardioversion of AF, using simultaneously recorded electrocardiogram [ECG] as gold standard. RESULTS: A total of 18,608 consecutive R-R-interval measurements were recorded simultaneously with PPG and ECG in 20 patients, including 12,521 [67.3%] R-R-intervals during AF and 6087 [32.7%] R-R intervals during sinus rhythm. Scatter plots and Bland-Altman plots demonstrated that the PPG signals were highly correlated to the simultaneously recorded ECG [R = 0.980, p < 0.001], both during AF and during sinus rhythm. The automatic algorithm distinguished AF from sinus rhythm with a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 93.1%. CONCLUSIONS: This PPG-based wrist-watch sensor reliably detected AF in non-ambulatory patients.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To develop a personalizable algorithm to discriminate between sedation  levels in ICU patients based on heart rate variability. DESIGN: Multicenter, pilot study. SETTING: Several ICUs at Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA. PATIENTS: We gathered 21,912 hours of routine electrocardiogram recordings from a heterogenous group of 70 adult ICU patients. All patients included in the study were mechanically ventilated and were receiving sedatives. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: As "ground truth" for developing our method, we used Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale scores grouped into four levels denoted "comatose" (-5), "deeply sedated" (-4 to -3), "lightly sedated" (-2 to 0), and "agitated" (+1 to +4). We trained a support vector machine learning algorithm to calculate the probability of each sedation level from heart rate variability measures derived from the electrocardiogram. To estimate algorithm performance, we calculated leave-one-subject out cross-validated accuracy. The patient-independent version of the proposed system discriminated between the four sedation levels with an overall accuracy of 59%. Upon personalizing the system supplementing the training data with patient-specific calibration data, consisting of an individual's labeled heart rate variability epochs from the preceding 24 hours, accuracy improved to 67%. The personalized system discriminated between light- and deep-sedation states with an average accuracy of 75%. CONCLUSIONS: With further refinement, the methodology reported herein could lead to a fully automated system for depth of sedation monitoring. By enabling monitoring to be continuous, such technology may help clinical staff to monitor sedation levels more effectively and to reduce complications related to over- and under sedation.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Early repolarization (ER) is defined as an elevation of the QRS-ST  junction in at least two inferior or lateral leads of the standard 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG). Our purpose was to create an algorithm for the automated detection and classification of ER. METHODS: A total of 6,047 electrocardiograms were manually graded for ER by two experienced readers. The automated detection of ER was based on quantification of the characteristic slurring or notching in ER-positive leads. The ER detection algorithm was tested and its results were compared with manual grading, which served as the reference. RESULTS: Readers graded 183 ECGs (3.0%) as ER positive, of which the algorithm detected 176 recordings, resulting in sensitivity of 96.2%. Of the 5,864 ER-negative recordings, the algorithm classified 5,281 as negative, resulting in 90.1% specificity. Positive and negative predictive values for the algorithm were 23.2% and 99.9%, respectively, and its accuracy was 90.2%. Inferior ER was correctly detected in 84.6% and lateral ER in 98.6% of the cases. CONCLUSIONS: As the automatic algorithm has high sensitivity, it could be used as a prescreening tool for ER; only the electrocardiograms graded positive by the algorithm would be reviewed manually. This would reduce the need for manual labor by 90%.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate to what extent timing definitions  influence strain measurements and which surrogates are reliable and feasible to define end-diastole (ED) and end-systole (ES) during speckle-tracking (STI) analysis. BACKGROUND: Current STI-based strain measurements are highly automated. It remains unclear when a particular analysis software defines the zero baseline and the systolic strain measurement position. METHODS: A total of 60 subjects (20 healthy volunteers, 20 patients with coronary artery disease, and 20 patients with typical left bundle-branch block) underwent a complete echocardiographic examination. In one-half of them, a real M-mode through the mitral valve was acquired for each electrocardiographic (ECG) lead of the echo machine. Timing of peak R and automatic ECG trigger were compared with mitral valve closure for every electrode. Mitral and aortic valve closure, as observed in the apical 3-chamber view, served as reference for ED and ES. With the use of these references, end-systolic global longitudinal strain (ES-GLS) and end-systolic segmental longitudinal strain (ES-SLS) longitudinal end-systolic strain were measured at baseline and after changing the definition of either ED or ES by ±4 frames. Furthermore, strain and volume curves derived from the same tracking, as well as the Doppler interrogation of the valves, were compared with the references. RESULTS: Depending on the selected lead, timing of the ECG-derived time markers changed considerably compared with mitral valve closure. Changing the definition of ED and ES resulted in significantly different ES-GLS and ES-SLS values in all subjects. ES-SLS in dyssynchronous hearts showed the highest sensitivity to timing definition. From all methods, spectral Doppler was the most reliable time marker in all subjects (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Exact temporal definition of ED and ES has a major impact on the accuracy of strain measurements. After direct observation of the valves, Doppler evaluation is the best means for characterizing ED and ES for STI analysis.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Testing the hypothesis that alterations in non-linear dynamics of the  cardiovascular variability appear in healthy, awake subjects during voluntary apnea. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Ten young subjects performed 20 apneas 60 s each separated by 1 min free breathing. Inter-beat interval (IBI) measured as RR-interval in ECG, systolic (SYS) and diastolic (DIAS) arterial blood pressure. stroke volume (SV), cardiac output (CO) and total peripheral resistance (TPR) were non-invasively recorded and computed by Portapress 2 system. Correlation dimension according to Grassberger-Proccacia algorithm (CD) and ratio of % determinism versus % recurrence (RDR) computed from recurrence plot according to Webber and Zbiluth [J. Appl. Physiol. 76 (1994) 965] were used as the indices of chaos and complexity. Sequential time series of cardiovascular variables in consecutive 60-s apneas and inter-apnea free breathings were separately windowed and aggregated. CD and RDR of aggregated apneic time series were compared with CD and RDR values of aggregated time series of inter-apnea free breathing, 10 min at rest and 10 min recovery. Reliability of the aggregation method of sequential time series was tested on transformed simulated data generated by Lorenz model. Error in CD and RDR estimation did not exceed 5% and 1%. respectively. RESULTS: CD of cardiovascular variables computed from aggregated apneas was significantly reduced and RDR augmented versus control and recovery periods. CD and RDR values of inter-apnea phases were in between those in control and during apneas. Time domain linear variance (SD) was increased during aggregated apneas. CONCLUSIONS: Signal dynamics dependent windowing and data aggregation could be a useful tool for non-linear analysis of short repeatable sequential time series; time domain linear variability of the cardiovascular dynamics is augmented while complexity reduced during apneic chemoreceptor stimulation; alterations in non-linear dynamics of cardiovascular variables during apneas in healthy normotensive subjects may suggest an early sign of a mechanism implicated in arterial hypertension in OSAS.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to compare QT/RR relation based on a 15-s  averaged beat ECG with a single beat ECG during atrial fibrillation (AF) and to determine which was better to estimate the QT interval after sinus restoration. METHODS AND RESULTS: QT and RR intervals were measured using an automatic QT analyzing system in 33 patients who had both AF and sinus rhythm on the same 24-h Holter ECG recording. In 14 patients, antiarrhythmic drugs (AAD) were administered. QT/RR relations were analyzed from ECG waves obtained by the summation of consecutive QRS-T complexes during each 15-s period (QT/RR-average) and a single beat QRS-T (QT/RR-single). During sinus rhythm, the slope of QT/RR-average did not differ from that of QT/RR-single in patients with and without AAD. On the other hand, during AF, the slope of QT/RR-average was significantly greater than that of QT/RR-single (without AAD: 0.12±0.06 vs. 0.06±0.03, P<0.001; with AAD: 0.15±0.05 vs. 0.08±0.04, P<0.001). During AF, the QT interval at an RR interval of 1.2-s (QT-1.2) determined from QT/RR-average was significantly greater than QT-1.2 from QT/RR-single in patients with and without AAD. QT-1.2 in QT/RR-single during AF was significantly smaller than that during sinus rhythm but QT-1.2 in QT/RR-average during AF was not. CONCLUSIONS: The QT interval after sinus restoration could be estimated better using QT/RR-average than using QT/RR-single during AF.

N2  - Experimentally and clinically collected time series data are often contaminated with  significant confounding noise, creating short, noisy time series. This noise, due to natural variability and measurement error, poses a challenge to conventional change point detection methods. We propose a novel and robust statistical method for change point detection for noisy biological time sequences. Our method is a significant improvement over traditional change point detection methods, which only examine a potential anomaly at a single time point. In contrast, our method considers all suspected anomaly points and considers the joint probability distribution of the number of change points and the elapsed time between two consecutive anomalies. We validate our method with three simulated time series, a widely accepted benchmark data set, two geological time series, a data set of ECG recordings, and a physiological data set of heart rate variability measurements of fetal sheep model of human labor, comparing it to three existing methods. Our method demonstrates significantly improved performance over the existing point-wise detection methods.

N2  - BACKGROUND: It is estimated that 33.5 million people in the world have developed  atrial fibrillation (AF), and an estimated 30% of patients with AF are unaware of their diagnosis (silent AF). OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to test a new technology for contactless detection of AF based on facial video recordings. METHODS: The proposed technique uses a camera to record an individual's face and extract the subtle beat-to-beat variations of skin color reflecting the cardiac pulsatile signal. In a group of adults referred for electrical cardioversion, we recorded the ECG and the video of the subjects' face before and after electrical cardioversion. We extracted the beat-to-beat pulse rates expressed as pulses per minute (ppm) from the videoplethysmographic (VPG) signal acquired using a standard web camera. We introduce a novel quantifier of pulse variability called the pulse harmonic strength (PHS) and report its ability to detect the presence of AF. RESULTS: Eleven subjects (8 male; age 65 ± 6 years) were included in the study. The VPG and ECG-based rates were statistically different between the AF and sinus rhythm periods: 72 ± 9 ppm vs 57 ± 7 ppm (P < .0001) for VPG and 80 ± 17 bpm vs 56 ± 7 bpm (P < .0001) for ECG signals. Among the 407 epochs of 15 seconds of synchronized ECG and VPG signals, PHS was associated with a 20% detection error rate, and the error rates of the automatic ECG-based measurements ranged between 17% and 29%. CONCLUSION: Our preliminary results support the concept that contactless video-based monitoring of the human face for detection of abnormal pulse variability due to AF is feasible.

N2  - This paper presents the development and validation of a novel multi-sensory wearable  system (Personal Automatic Cigarette Tracker v2 or PACT2.0) for monitoring of cigarette smoking in free-living conditions. The contributions of the PACT2.0 system are: (1) the implementation of a complete sensor suite for monitoring of all major behavioral manifestations of cigarette smoking (lighting events, hand-to-mouth gestures, and smoke inhalations); (2) a miniaturization of the sensor hardware to enable its applicability in naturalistic settings; and (3) an introduction of new sensor modalities that may provide additional insight into smoking behavior e.g., Global Positioning System (GPS), pedometer and Electrocardiogram(ECG) or provide an easy-to-use alternative (e.g., bio-impedance respiration sensor) to traditional sensors. PACT2.0 consists of three custom-built devices: an instrumented lighter, a hand module, and a chest module. The instrumented lighter is capable of recording the time and duration of all lighting events. The hand module integrates Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and a Radio Frequency (RF) transmitter to track the hand-to-mouth gestures. The module also operates as a pedometer. The chest module monitors the breathing (smoke inhalation) patterns (inductive and bio-impedance respiratory sensors), cardiac activity (ECG sensor), chest movement (three-axis accelerometer), hand-to-mouth proximity (RF receiver), and captures the geo-position of the subject (GPS receiver). The accuracy of PACT2.0 sensors was evaluated in bench tests and laboratory experiments. Use of PACT2.0 for data collection in the community was validated in a 24 h study on 40 smokers. Of 943 h of recorded data, 98.6% of the data was found usable for computer analysis. The recorded information included 549 lighting events, 522/504 consumed cigarettes (from lighter data/self-registered data, respectively), 20,158/22,207 hand-to-mouth gestures (from hand IMU/proximity sensor, respectively) and 114,217/112,175 breaths (from the respiratory inductive plethysmograph (RIP)/bio-impedance sensor, respectively). The proposed system scored 8.3 ± 0.31 out of 10 on a post-study acceptability survey. The results suggest that PACT2.0 presents a reliable platform for studying of smoking behavior at the community level.

N2  - The aim of this study is to evaluate the discriminative power of sequential spectrum  analysis of the short-term electrocardiogram (ECG) time series in separating normal and congestive heart failure (CHF) subjects. The raw ECG time series is transformed into a series of discretized binary symbols and the distribution of mono-sequences (i.e., tuples containing only one type of symbol '0' or '1') is computed. The relative distribution of mono-sequences containing only one type of symbol constitutes binary occupancy for that symbol in the sequential spectrum. The quantified approximate entropies of the binary occupancies in the sequential spectra are found to have potential in discriminating normal and CHF subjects and thus can significantly add to the prognostic value of traditional cardiac analysis. The statistical analyses and the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis confirm the robustness of this new approach, which exhibits an average accuracy, average sensitivity, average positive predictivity, and average specificity, all 100.0%.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Cardiogoniometry (CGM), a spatiotemporal electrocardiologic method may  be useful as a cardiovascular diagnostic tool. Increased incidence of coronary artery or myocardial involvement and defects in automatic setting of heart activity have been reported in psoriasis which could be related to the presence of systemic inflammation. Cardiogoniometry and the related parameters have been used in this study as a diagnostic technique in psoriasis patients. METHODS: Thirty patients with psoriasis and 30 healthy, age and sex-matched individuals with no history of cardiovascular diseases or traditional coronary risk factors were enrolled. Duration and severity of the disease, using psoriasis severity and area index (PASI) score were recorded. Electrocardiography and cardiogoniometry were performed. Heart rate, QT interval and QT dispersion (QTD) were measured. SDNN (standard deviation of normal R-R interval) and myocardial ischemia score were determined by cardiogoniometry. RESULTS: There was significant difference between the psoriasis patients and the controls in terms of heart rate (76.37±14.41 vs 72.53±9.684, p=0.02), myocardial ischemia score (-1.53±2.63 vs -0.46±0.73, p=0.037), corrected QT interval (392.64±26.00 vs 377.26±22.34, p=0.017) and QTD (32.00±17.88 vs 6.67±15.16, p<0.001). No statistically significant difference was found in SDNN (36.37±21.01 vs 26.90±14.88, p=.29). There were moderate correlation between PASI and SDNN (r=0.427, p=0.009), heart rate (r=0.427, p=.009) and score (r=0.481, p=.004). CONCLUSION: Abnormalities in resting ECG and CGM and their correlation with disease severity raises concerns about the need for cardiovascular follow-ups of psoriatic patients, especially those with severe disease.

N2  - This study was designed to test if changes in the degree of respiratory sinus  arrhythmia (RSA) can be used as an index of light anaesthesia. An on-line, real-time data logging system was used to record simultaneously the EEG and ECG waveforms from 10 patients undergoing routine surgery using i.v. propofol (Diprivan) anaesthesia. The degree of RSA was determined in real-time. The median frequency of the EEG was derived off-line and correlated with the degree of RSA. Time series analysis was performed on the derived indices off-line. Significant changes in the degree of RSA occurred in response to changes in propofol infusion in all patients; these changes corresponded also to changes in the median frequency of the EEG. Heart rate and ventilatory frequency are measured routinely during surgery and it is suggested that on-line monitoring of RSA, derived from these standard signals, provides a more convenient and objective index of lightening anaesthesia than either EEG analysis or classical estimates of anaesthetic depth based on arterial pressure or heart rate.

N2  - Autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity and imbalance between its sympathetic and  parasympathetic components are important factors contributing to the initiation and progression of many cardiovascular disorders related to obesity. The results on respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) magnitude changes as a parasympathetic index were not straightforward in previous studies on young obese subjects. Considering the potentially unbalanced ANS regulation with impaired parasympathetic control in obese patients, the aim of this study was to compare the relative contribution of baroreflex and non-baroreflex (central) mechanisms to the origin of RSA in obese vs. control subjects. To this end, we applied a recently proposed information-theoretic methodology - partial information decomposition (PID) - to the time series of heart rate variability (HRV, computed from RR intervals in the ECG), systolic blood pressure (SBP) variability, and respiration (RESP) pattern measured in 29 obese and 29 age- and gender-matched non-obese adolescents and young adults monitored in the resting supine position and during postural and cognitive stress evoked by head-up tilt and mental arithmetic. PID was used to quantify the so-called unique information transferred from RESP to HRV and from SBP to HRV, reflecting, respectively, non-baroreflex and RESP-unrelated baroreflex HRV mechanisms, and the redundant information transferred from (RESP, SBP) to HRV, reflecting RESP-related baroreflex RSA mechanisms. Our results suggest that obesity is associated: (i) with blunted involvement of non-baroreflex RSA mechanisms, documented by the lower unique information transferred from RESP to HRV at rest; and (ii) with a reduced response to postural stress (but not to mental stress), documented by the lack of changes in the unique information transferred from RESP and SBP to HRV in obese subjects moving from supine to upright, and by a decreased redundant information transfer in obese compared to controls in the upright position. These findings were observed in the presence of an unchanged RSA magnitude measured as the high frequency (HF) power of HRV, thus suggesting that the changes in ANS imbalance related to obesity in adolescents and young adults are subtle and can be revealed by dissecting RSA mechanisms into its components during various challenges.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the leading cause of death globally.  Electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis can provide thoroughly assessment for different CVDs efficiently. We propose a multi-task group bidirectional long short-term memory (MTGBi-LSTM) framework to intelligent recognize multiple CVDs based on multi-lead ECG signals. METHODS: This model employs a Group Bi-LSTM (GBi-LSTM) and Residual Group Convolutional Neural Network (Res-GCNN) to learn the dual feature representation of ECG space and time series. GBi-LSTM is divided into Global Bi-LSTM and Intra-Group Bi-LSTM, which can learn the features of each ECG lead and the relationship between leads. Then, through attention mechanism, the different lead information of ECG is integrated to make the model to possess the powerful feature discriminability. Through multi-task learning, the model can fully mine the association information between diseases and obtain more accurate diagnostic results. In addition, we propose a dynamic weighted loss function to better quantify the loss to overcome the imbalance between classes. RESULTS: Based on more than 170,000 clinical 12-lead ECG analysis, the MTGBi-LSTM method achieved accuracy, precision, recall and F1 of 88.86%, 90.67%, 94.19% and 92.39%, respectively. The experimental results show that the proposed MTGBi-LSTM method can reliably realize ECG analysis and provide an effective tool for computer-aided diagnosis of CVD.

N2  - An elderly man was transferred to our emergency department with reported ventricular  tachycardia requiring intravenous amiodarone and intensive care unit admission. Device interrogation, the following day, revealed only frequent premature ventricular contractions and non-sustained ventricular tachycardia in a patient with a known history of these conditions. The patient underwent unnecessary invasive monitoring after being emergently transferred to our facility and admitted to the intensive care unit. Fortunately, our patient did not suffer any unwarranted side effects from intravenous amiodarone. This case reports on some negative consequences of inappropriate intensive care unit admissions and how they could have been avoided.

N2  - PURPOSE: To establish the radiation dose level for single- and dual-source thoracic  CT scans in daily practice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The dose levels delivered during 634 consecutive examinations over a period of 2 months were recorded. The CT scans were performed using: (a) a standard protocol (single source, single energy [group 1]: n=266; dual source, single energy [group 2]: n=276; (b) with prospective ECG synchronisation [group 3]: n=13; or (c) with dual energy [group 4]: n=79. All the acquisitions included kilovoltage selection depending on the weight and automatic milliamperage modulation. RESULTS: The mean DLP of the standard protocols was 97.12 mGycm (group 2; BMI=23.1kg/m(2)) and 211.1 mGycm (group 1; BMI=27.3kg/m(2)), the choice of protocol depending on the diameter of the thorax relative to the diameter of the field of the second source, and therefore on the patient's morphotype. When imaging included examination of the proximal and middle coronary arteries (group 3), the mean DLP was 105.5 mGycm. Morphological and functional imaging (group 4) was obtained with a mean DLP of 404.3 mGycm. CONCLUSION: Depending on the objective of the protocol, the mean DLP varied from 97.12 to 404.3 mGycm.

N2  - Heart rate recovery after exercise, thought to be related to cardiac parasympathetic  tone, has been shown to be a prognostic tool for all-cause mortality. However, the relationship between this variable and confirmed susceptibility to ventricular fibrillation (VF) has not been established. Therefore, myocardial ischemia was induced with a 2-min occlusion of the left circumflex artery during the last minute of exercise in mongrel dogs with myocardial infarction (n = 105 dogs). VF was induced in 66 animals (susceptible), whereas the remaining 39 dogs had no arrhythmias (resistant). On a previous day, ECG was recorded and a time-series analysis of heart rate variability was measured 30, 60, and 120 s after submaximal exercise (treadmill running). The heart rate recovery was significantly greater in resistant dogs than in susceptible dogs at all three times, with the most dramatic difference at the 30-s mark (change from maximum: 48.1 +/- 3.6 beats/min, resistant dogs; 31.0 +/- 2.2 beats/min, susceptible dogs). Correspondingly, indexes of parasympathetic tone increased to a significantly greater extent in resistant dogs at 30 and 60 s after exercise. These differences were eliminated by atropine pretreatment. When considered together, these data suggest that resistant animals exhibit a more rapid recovery of vagal activity after exercise than those susceptible to VF. As such, postexercise heart rate recovery may help identify patients with a high risk for VF following myocardial infarction.

N2  - Many real-world systems such as irregular ECG signal, volatility of currency  exchange rate and heated fluid reaction exhibit highly complex nonlinear characteristic known as chaos. These chaotic systems cannot be retreated satisfactorily using linear system theory due to its high dimensionality and irregularity. This research focuses on prediction and modelling of chaotic FIR (Far InfraRed) laser system for which the underlying equations are not given. This paper proposed a method for prediction and modelling a chaotic FIR laser time series using rational function neural network. Three network architectures, TDNN (Time Delayed Neural Network), RBF (radial basis function) network and the RF (rational function) network, are also presented. Comparisons between these networks performance show the improvements introduced by the RF network in terms of a decrement in network complexity and better ability of predictability.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Cardiovascular mortality is significantly increased in patients suffering  from schizophrenia. The mechanisms currently discussed contain unhealthy lifestyle with obesity and smoking, increased incidence of diabetes, adverse pro-arrhythmic effects of antipsychotic medication and altered autonomic function. It is therefore likely that the adaptation of the heart rate to different requirements is faulty in schizophrenia. One way to detect adaptive capabilities and thus stability of regulation is to measure complexity of heart rate fluctuations, with more complex heart rate fluctuations indicating better adaptability of the underlying system. METHODS: We calculated novel non-linear measures for beat-to-beat interval complexity from short-term ECG recordings in 20 unmedicated patients suffering from acute schizophrenia and compared them to those obtained from matched controls. RESULTS: Data from all mathematical models applied, i.e. joint symbolic dynamics, compression entropy, fractal dimension and approximate entropy, revealed significantly reduced complexity of heart rate time series in acute schizophrenia. When using heart rate as a covariate, only fractal dimension remained significantly altered, thus appearing to be a relatively more important heart rate independent parameter. CONCLUSIONS: Complexity of heart rate modulation is significantly reduced in acute, untreated schizophrenia, thus indicating an increased risk for cardiovascular events in these patients. SIGNIFICANCE: These data might eventually add to the currently discussed monitoring of physical health in patients with schizophrenia, possibly providing a promising tool for cardio-arrhythmic risk stratification.

N2  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: New aspects for automatic electrocardiography artifact  removal from surface electromyography signals by application of fractional order calculus in combination with linear and nonlinear moving window filters are explored. Surface electromyography recordings of skeletal trunk muscles are commonly contaminated with spike shaped artifacts. This artifact originates from electrical heart activity, recorded by electrocardiography, commonly present in the surface electromyography signals recorded in heart proximity. For appropriate assessment of neuromuscular changes by means of surface electromyography, application of a proper filtering technique of electrocardiography artifact is crucial. METHODS: A novel method for automatic artifact cancellation in surface electromyography signals by applying fractional order calculus and nonlinear median filter is introduced. The proposed method is compared with the linear moving average filter, with and without prior application of fractional order calculus. 3D graphs for assessment of window lengths of the filters, crest factors, root mean square differences, and fractional calculus orders (called WFC and WRC graphs) have been introduced. For an appropriate quantitative filtering evaluation, the synthetic electrocardiography signal and analogous semi-synthetic dataset have been generated. The examples of noise removal in 10 able-bodied subjects and in one patient with muscle dystrophy are presented for qualitative analysis. RESULTS: The crest factors, correlation coefficients, and root mean square differences of the recorded and semi-synthetic electromyography datasets showed that the most successful method was the median filter in combination with fractional order calculus of the order 0.9. Statistically more significant (p < 0.001) ECG peak reduction was obtained by the median filter application compared to the moving average filter in the cases of low level amplitude of muscle contraction compared to ECG spikes. CONCLUSIONS: The presented results suggest that the novel method combining a median filter and fractional order calculus can be used for automatic filtering of electrocardiography artifacts in the surface electromyography signal envelopes recorded in trunk muscles.

N2  - Premature ventricular contraction (PVC) is a common type of abnormal heartbeat.  Without early diagnosis and proper treatment, PVC may result in serious harms. Diagnosis of PVC is of great importance in goal-directed treatment and preoperation prognosis. This paper proposes a novel diagnostic method for PVC based on Lyapunov exponents of electrocardiogram (ECG) beats. The methodology consists of preprocessing, feature extraction and classification integrated into the system. PVC beats can be classified and differentiated from other types of abnormal heartbeats by analyzing Lyapunov exponents and training a learning vector quantization (LVQ) neural network. Our algorithm can obtain a good diagnostic result with little features by using single lead ECG data. The sensitivity, positive predictability, and the overall accuracy of the automatic diagnosis of PVC is 90.26%, 92.31%, and 98.90%, respectively. The effectiveness of the new method is validated through extensive tests using data from MIT-BIH database. The experimental results show that the proposed method is efficient and robust.

N2  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: This study demonstrates deep learning approaches with an  aim to find the optimal method to automatically detect sleep apnea (SA) events from an electrocardiogram (ECG) signal. METHODS: Six deep learning approaches were designed and implemented for automatic detection of SA events including deep neural network (DNN), one-dimensional (1D) convolutional neural networks (CNN), two-dimensional (2D) CNN, recurrent neural networks (RNN), long short-term memory, and gated-recurrent unit (GRU). Designed deep learning models were analyzed and compared in the performances. The ECG signal was pre-processed, normalized, and segmented into 10 s intervals. Subsequently, the signal was converted into a 2D form for analysis in the 2D CNN model. A dataset collected from 86 patients with SA was used. The training set comprised data from 69 of the patients, while the test set contained data from the remaining 17 patients. RESULTS: The accuracy of the best-performing model was 99.0%, and the 1D CNN and GRU models had 99.0% recall rates. CONCLUSIONS: The designed deep learning approaches performed better than those developed and tested in previous studies in terms of detecting SA events, and they could distinguish between apnea and hypopnea events using an ECG signal. The deep learning approaches such as 1D CNN and GRU can be helpful tools to automatically detect SA in sleep apnea screening and related studies.

N2  - Actograms are well-established methods used for visualizing periodic activity of  animals in chronobiological research. They help in the understanding of the overall characteristics of rhythms and are instrumental in defining the direction of subsequent detailed analysis. Although there exists specialized software for creating actograms, new users such as students and researchers from other fields often find it inconvenient to use. In this study, we demonstrate a fast and easy method to create actograms using Microsoft Excel. As operations in Excel are simple and user-friendly, it takes only a few minutes to create an actogram. Using this method, it is possible to obtain a visual understanding of the characteristics of rhythms not only from typical activity data, but also from any kind of time-series data such as body temperature, blood sugar level, gene expressions, sleep electroencephalogram, heartbeat, and so on. The actogram thus created can also be converted to the "heatogram" shown by color temperature. As opposed to conventional chronograms, this new type of chronogram facilitates easy understanding of rhythmic features in a more intuitive manner. This method is therefore convenient and beneficial for a broad range of researchers including students as it aids in the better understanding of periodic phenomena from a large amount of time-series data.

N2  - The classification of electrocardiograms (ECG) plays an important role in the  clinical diagnosis of heart disease. This paper proposes an effective system development and implementation for ECG classification based on faster regions with a convolutional neural network (Faster R-CNN) algorithm. The original one-dimensional ECG signals contain the preprocessed patient ECG signals and some ECG recordings from the MIT-BIH database in this experiment. Each ECG beat of one-dimensional ECG signals was transformed into a two-dimensional image for experimental training sets and test sets. As a result, we classified the ECG beats into five categories with an average accuracy of 99.21%. In addition, we did a comparative experiment using the one versus rest support vector machine (OVR SVM) algorithm, and the classification accuracy of the proposed Faster R-CNN was shown to be 2.59% higher.

N2  - Heart rate variability (HRV) analysis represents an important tool for the  characterization of complex cardiovascular control. HRV indexes are usually calculated from electrocardiographic (ECG) recordings after measuring the time duration between consecutive R peaks, and this is considered the gold standard. An alternative method consists of assessing the pulse rate variability (PRV) from signals acquired through photoplethysmography, a technique also employed for the continuous noninvasive monitoring of blood pressure. In this work, we carry out a thorough analysis and comparison of short-term variability indexes computed from HRV time series obtained from the ECG and from PRV time series obtained from continuous blood pressure (CBP) signals, in order to evaluate the reliability of using CBP-based recordings in place of standard ECG tracks. The analysis has been carried out on short time series (300 beats) of HRV and PRV in 76 subjects studied in different conditions: resting in the supine position, postural stress during 45° head-up tilt, and mental stress during computation of arithmetic test. Nine different indexes have been taken into account, computed in the time domain (mean, variance, root mean square of the successive differences), frequency domain (low-to-high frequency power ratio LF/HF, HF spectral power, and central frequency), and information domain (entropy, conditional entropy, self entropy). Thorough validation has been performed using comparison of the HRV and PRV distributions, robust linear regression, and Bland-Altman plots. Results demonstrate the feasibility of extracting HRV indexes from CBP-based data, showing an overall relatively good agreement of time-, frequency-, and information-domain measures. The agreement decreased during postural and mental arithmetic stress, especially with regard to band-power ratio, conditional, and self-entropy. This finding suggests to use caution in adopting PRV as a surrogate of HRV during stress conditions.

N2  - Cardiovascular diseases are the first cause of death in developed countries. Using  electrocardiographic (ECG), blood pressure (BP) and respiratory flow signals, we obtained parameters for classifying cardiomyopathy patients. 42 patients with ischemic (ICM) and dilated (DCM) cardiomyopathies were studied. The left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was used to stratify patients with low risk (LR: LVEF>35%, 14 patients) and high risk (HR: LVEF≤ 35%, 28 patients) of heart attack. RR, SBP and TTot time series were extracted from the ECG, BP and respiratory flow signals, respectively. The time series were transformed to a binary space and then analyzed using Joint Symbolic Dynamic with a word length of three, characterizing them by the probability of occurrence of the words. Extracted parameters were then reduced using correlation and statistical analysis. Principal component analysis and support vector machines methods were applied to characterize the cardiorespiratory and cardiovascular interactions in ICM and DCM cardiomyopathies, obtaining an accuracy of 85.7%.

N2  - Our study focuses on classifying as significant Electrocardiogram (ECG) data from  home healthcare system. Generally, spectral analysis of RR Interval (RRI) time series is used to determine periodic component of Heart Rate Variability (HRV). It is well known, moreover, that Low Frequency (LF) component is associated with blood pressure regulation, and High Frequency (HF) component is referred to respiration as Respiration Sinus Arrhythmia (RSA) in the HRV power spectra. In many cases, however, LF and HF components may be entirely superimposed on each other and, therefore, the method by division of power spectra range can not be evaluated diagnostically. We propose another approach to interpret well better than before. The method which we suggest is that it finds high correlative data using frequency analysis comparison Heart Instantaneous Frequency (HIF) based on extracting the instantaneous fundamental frequency with EDR. The reason which we use HIF is that it is simpler and more powerful against noise than HRV. First of all, we show the EDR extraction process, and then prove that HIF signal is useful or not through comparison with HRV. Finally, we classify significant signal data through comparison High Frequency (HF) component obtained frequency analysis of HIF with that of EDR.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: Automatic slice alignment is important for easier operation and shorter  examination times in cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations. We propose a new automatic slice alignment method for six cardiac planes (short-axis, vertical long-axis, horizontal long-axis, 4-chamber, 2-chamber, and 3-chamber views). MATERIALS AND METHODS: ECG-gated 2D steady-state free precession axial multislice images were acquired using a 1.5-T MRI scanner during a single breath-hold. The scanning time was set to <20 s in 23 volumes from 23 healthy volunteers. In this method, the positions of the mitral valve, cardiac apex, left ventricular outflow tract, tricuspid valve, anterior wall of the heart, and right ventricular corner are detected to determine the positions of six reference planes by combining knowledge-based recognition and image processing techniques. In order to evaluate the results of automatic slice alignment for the short-axis, 4-chamber, 2-chamber, and 3-chamber views, the angular and positional errors between the results obtained by our proposed method and by manual annotation were measured. RESULTS: The average angular errors for the short-axis, 4-chamber, 2-chamber, and 3-chamber views were 3.05°, 4.52°, 7.28°, and 5.79°, respectively. The average positional errors for the short-axis (base), short-axis (apex), 4-chamber, 2-chamber, and 3-chamber views were 6.61°, 3.80°, 1.55°, 1.52°, and 1.48°, respectively. CONCLUSION: The experimental results showed that our proposed method can detect the cardiac planes quickly and accurately. Our method is therefore beneficial to both patients and operators.

N2  - Cardiac arrhythmia or irregular heartbeats are an important feature to assess the  risk on sudden cardiac death and other cardiac disorders. Automatic classification of irregular heartbeats is therefore an important part of ECG analysis. We propose a tensor-based method for single- and multi-channel irregular heartbeat classification. The method tensorizes the ECG data matrix by segmenting each signal beat-by-beat and then stacking the result into a third-order tensor with dimensions channel × time × heartbeat. We use the multilinear singular value decomposition to model the obtained tensor. Next, we formulate the classification task as the computation of a Kronecker Product Equation. We apply our method on the INCART dataset, illustrating promising results.

N2  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: We describe the association of implementing a History, ECG, Age,  Risk Factors, and Troponin (HEART) care pathway on use of hospital care and noninvasive stress testing, as well as 30-day patient outcomes in community emergency departments (EDs). METHODS: We performed a prospective interrupted-time-series study of adult encounters for patients evaluated for suspected acute coronary syndrome. The primary outcome was hospitalization or observation, noninvasive stress testing, or both within 30 days. The secondary outcome was 30-day all-cause mortality or acute myocardial infarction. A generalized estimating equation segmented logistic regression model was used to compare the odds of the primary outcome before and after HEART implementation. All models were adjusted for patient and facility characteristics and fit with physicians as a clustering variable. RESULTS: A total of 65,393 ED encounters (before, 30,522; after, 34,871) were included in the study. Overall, 33.5% (before, 35.5%; after, 31.8%) of ED chest pain encounters resulted in hospitalization or observation, noninvasive stress testing, or both. Primary adjusted results found a significant decrease in the primary outcome postimplementation (odds ratio 0.984; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.974 to 0.995). This resulted in an absolute adjusted month-to-month decrease of 4.39% (95% CI 3.72% to 5.07%) after 12 months' follow-up, with a continued trend downward. There was no difference in 30-day mortality or myocardial infarction (0.6% [before] versus 0.6% [after]; odds ratio 1.02; 95% CI 0.97 to 1.08). CONCLUSION: Implementation of a HEART pathway in the ED evaluation of patients with chest pain resulted in less inpatient care and noninvasive cardiac testing and was safe. Using HEART to risk stratify chest pain patients can improve the efficiency and quality of care.

N2  - Diagnosis of long-term electrocardiogram (ECG) calls for automatic and accurate  methods of ECG signal quality estimation, not only to lighten the burden of the doctors but also to avoid misdiagnoses. In this paper, a novel waveform-based method of phase-space reconstruction for signal quality estimation on a single lead ECG was proposed by projecting the amplitude of the ECG and its first order difference into grid cells. The waveform of a single lead ECG was divided into non-overlapping episodes (T(s) = 10, 20, 30 s), and the number of grids in both the width and the height of each map are in the range [20, 100] (N(X) = N(Y) = 20, 30, 40, … 90, 100). The blank pane ratio (BPR) and the entropy were calculated from the distribution of ECG sampling points which were projected into the grid cells. Signal Quality Indices (SQI) bSQI and eSQI were calculated according to the BPR and the entropy, respectively. The MIT-BIH Noise Stress Test Database was used to test the performance of bSQI and eSQI on ECG signal quality estimation. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) during the noisy segments of the ECG records in the database is 24, 18, 12, 6, 0 and - 6 dB, respectively. For the SQI quantitative analysis, the records were divided into three groups: good quality group (24, 18 dB), moderate group (12, 6 dB) and bad quality group (0, - 6 dB). The classification among good quality group, moderate quality group and bad quality group were made by linear support-vector machine with the combination of the BPR, the entropy, the bSQI and the eSQI. The classification accuracy was 82.4% and the Cohen's Kappa coefficient was 0.74 on a scale of N(X) = 40 and T(s) = 20 s. In conclusion, the novel grid mapping offers an intuitive and simple approach to achieving signal quality estimation on a single lead ECG.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The usefulness of heart rate variability (HRV) as a clinical research  and diagnostic tool has been verified in numerous studies. The gold standard technique comprises analyzing time series of RR intervals from an electrocardiographic signal. However, some authors have used pulse cycle intervals instead of RR intervals, as they can be determined from a pulse wave (e.g. a photoplethysmographic) signal. This option is often called pulse rate variability (PRV), and utilizing it could expand the serviceability of pulse oximeters or simplify ambulatory monitoring of HRV. METHODS: We review studies investigating the accuracy of PRV as an estimate of HRV, regardless of the underlying technology (photoplethysmography, continuous blood pressure monitoring or Finapresi, impedance plethysmography). RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS: Results speak in favor of sufficient accuracy when subjects are at rest, although many studies suggest that short-term variability is somewhat overestimated by PRV, which reflects coupling effects between respiration and the cardiovascular system. Physical activity and some mental stressors seem to impair the agreement of PRV and HRV, often to an inacceptable extent. Findings regarding the position of the sensor or the detection algorithm are not conclusive. Generally, quantitative conclusions are impeded by the fact that results of different studies are mostly incommensurable due to diverse experimental settings and/or methods of analysis.

N2  - Estimating the instantaneous respiratory rate (Rr) from the electrocardiogram (ECG)  is of interest as respiration direct measurement in clinical situations is often cumbersome. In this study, the Rr was estimated from the same Final Directions of maximum projection (FD) used for multi lead ECG automatic delineation. Power spectral analysis over the directions based on QRS complex main peak and T wave onset, peak and end spatial loops was used for Rr estimation. On a subset of the Physionet MGH/MF dataset, the proposed method yielded more accurate Rr estimates (minimum mean absolute error (MAE), 2.82 bpm) than the frequency tracking algorithm (minimum MAE, 4.53 bpm) and Fourier-based frequency estimation (minimum MAE, 4.94 bpm) using each lead alone, outperforming also the weighted multi-signal oscillator-based algorithm estimates for two or three lead (minimum MAE, 3.04 bpm). It was also shown that the FD of the three orthogonalized leads from Principal Component algorithm, improve the performance of Rr estimation.

N2  - Automatic recognition of arrhythmias is particularly important in the diagnosis of  heart diseases. This study presents an electrocardiogram (ECG) recognition system based on multi-domain feature extraction to classify ECG beats. An improved wavelet threshold method for ECG signal pre-processing is applied to remove noise interference. A novel multi-domain feature extraction method is proposed; this method employs kernel-independent component analysis in nonlinear feature extraction and uses discrete wavelet transform to extract frequency domain features. The proposed system utilises a support vector machine classifier optimized with a genetic algorithm to recognize different types of heartbeats. An ECG acquisition experimental platform, in which ECG beats are collected as ECG data for classification, is constructed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the system in ECG beat classification. The presented system, when applied to the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database, achieves a high classification accuracy of 98.8%. Experimental results based on the ECG acquisition experimental platform show that the system obtains a satisfactory classification accuracy of 97.3% and is able to classify ECG beats efficiently for the automatic identification of cardiac arrhythmias.

N2  - The purpose of this study was to contribute to the improvement of stratification of  post-myocardial infarction patients at increased risk of malignant ventricular arrhythmia (MVA). Power spectral analysis of heart period variability (HPV) was used as a non-invasive tool to assess cardiac autonomic control. Three groups were used: (1) post-myocardial infarction patients with MVA; (2) post-myocardial infarction patients without MVA; and (3) a control group without heart disease. Spectral analysis of HPV (AR model) was performed on four minute long RR-interval time series derived from consecutive hours of Holter ECG. Significant decrease of powers of mid-frequency (MF) (70-150 mHz) and high-frequency (HF) (150-450 mHz) spectral components of HPV was obtained in Group 1 as compared to Group 2 (p = 0.001 and p = 0.02, respectively). There were no significant differences between groups concerning the power of low frequency (LF) (10-70 mHz) component HPV, spectra of patients in Group 1 were dominated by a single low frequency spectral peak (with a central frequency of 37 mHz). The relative power was computed as the percentage of power in each of the above (HF, MF, LF) components related to the total spectral power. Highly significant differences (p = 0.04) were obtained between Group 1 and Group 2 concerning relative powers of MF and LF components as well as LF/MF ratio. The above method appeared to be highly sensitive in differentiating patients with increased risk of MVA.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether there are differences in autonomic cardiovascular  regulation in resuscitated patients undergoing therapeutic hypothermia (TH) in relation to the clinical outcome. METHOD: Between 2005 and 2007, 18 consecutive resuscitated patients were enrolled. ECG and blood pressure data were recorded for 48 h during hypothermia and warming up to a body core temperature of 36°C. Autonomic regulation was assessed by applying time, frequency, and non-linear dynamics domain methods from heart rate and blood pressure variability (HRV/BPV) analyses. RESULTS: Nine patients survived with good neurological recovery, and nine patients died during the ICU stay. In both groups, we found a decreased HRV presented by standard deviation of R-R intervals (sdNN) below 50 ms(2) at each time of measurement. Immediately after recovery to a body core temperature of 36°C, a significant higher HRV was found in survivors compared to non-survivors by means of indices sdNN (40.2 ± 19.5 vs. 10.9 ± 4.1 ms(2), P = 0.01), R-R intervals distribution histogram [shannon] (3.7 ± 0.6 vs. 2.2 ± 0.4, P = 0.008), very low frequency band [VLF] (152.2 ± 99.3 vs. 3.4 ± 1.9, P = 0.001) and the variance of the time series of R-R intervals [Wsdvar] (1.16 ± 0.52 vs. 0.29 ± 0.25, P = 0.02) . A decreased spontaneous BPV was found only among survivors comparing blood pressure characteristics within stable hypothermia to the initial state before hypothermia. CONCLUSION: Resuscitated patients show a significantly reduced HRV before, during and after TH. Compared to survivors, the non-survivors show a further and significantly decrease of HRV immediately after hypothermia.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the change of the amplitude of P wave, T wave and ST segment  of 12 lead electrocardiogram (ECG) in children with breath holding spell.  METHODS: A total of 29 children (24 males and 5 females) with breath holding spell in Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University were enrolled for this study from October, 2009 to September, 2015. Their ages ranged from 3 months to 6 years, with an average of 1.82±1.27 years old. The control group consisted of 30 age-matched and gender-matched healthy children. All subjects were underwent electrocardiography by the SR-1000A comprehensive automatic electrocardiograph analyzer, and the changes of the ECG parameters were compared between the two groups.  RESULTS: Compared with the control group, the amplitude of P-wave of V5 lead was decreased [(44.10±23.98) vs (58.30±21.19) μV, P<0.05], the amplitude of T-wave of V6 lead was increased [(423.80±122.6) vs (350.00±105.73) μV, P<0.05], the amplitude of ST segment of II lead was increased [(84.80±39.97) vs (57.30±38.77) μV, P<0.05], the amplitude of ST segment of aVR lead was increased [(-77.60±37.41) vs (-51.00±33.46) μV, P<0.05], the amplitude of ST segment of aVL lead was increased [(35.20±28.24) vs (17.70±33.90) μV, P<0.05], the amplitude of ST segment of V5 lead was increased [(111.00±59.36) vs (69.00±36.33) μV, P<0.05], the amplitude of ST segment of V6 lead was increased [(79.30±45.51) vs (51.30±33.19) μV, P<0.05].   CONCLUSION: The children with breath holding spell have autonomic nerve dysfunction. The amplitude of ST segment changes is sensitive.

N2  - Accurate detection of cardiac pathological events is an important part of  electrocardiogram (ECG) evaluation and subsequent correct treatment of the patient. The paper introduces the results of a complex study, where various aspects of automatic classification of various heartbeat types have been addressed. Particularly, non-ischemic, ischemic (of two different grades) and subsequent ventricular premature beats were classified in this combination for the first time. ECGs recorded in rabbit isolated hearts under non-ischemic and ischemic conditions were used for analysis. Various morphological and spectral features (both commonly used and newly proposed) as well as classification models were tested on the same data set. It was found that: a) morphological features are generally more suitable than spectral ones; b) successful results (accuracy up to 98.3% and 96.2% for morphological and spectral features, respectively) can be achieved using features calculated without time-consuming delineation of QRS-T segment; c) use of reduced number of features (3 to 14 features) for model training allows achieving similar or even better performance as compared to the whole feature sets (10 to 29 features); d) k-nearest neighbours and support vector machine seem to be the most appropriate models (accuracy up to 98.6% and 93.5%, respectively).

N2  - Our goal is to use automatic data monitoring for reliable prediction of episodes of  intracranial hypertension in patients with traumatic brain injury. Here we test the validity of our method on retrospective patient data. We developed the Continuous Hemodynamic Autoregulatory Monitor (CHARM), that siphons and stores signals from existing monitors in the surgical intensive care unit (SICU), efficiently compresses them, and standardizes the search for statistical relationships between any proposed index and adverse events. CHARM uses an automated event detector to reliably locate episodes of elevated intracranial pressure (ICP), while eliminating artifacts within retrospective patient data. A graphical user interface allowed data scanning, selection of criteria for events, and calculating indices. The pressure reactivity index (PRx), defined as the least square linear regression slope of intracranial pressure versus arterial BP, was calculated for a single case that spanned 259 h. CHARM collected continuous records of ABP, ICP, ECG, SpO2, and ventilation from 29 patients with TBI over an 18-month period. Analysis of a single patient showed that PRx data distribution in the single hours immediately prior to all 16 intracranial hypertensive events, significantly differed from that in the 243 h that did not precede such events (p < 0.0001). The PRx index, however, lacked sufficient resolution as a real-time predictor of IH in this patient. CHARM streamlines the search for reliable predictors of intracranial hypertension. We report statistical evidence supporting the predictive potential of the pressure reactivity index.

N2  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: Non-convulsive seizures/status epilepticus occur in approximately  20% of comatose, non-cardiac arrest intensive care unit (ICU) patients, and are associated with increased mortality. The prevalence and clinical significance of seizures in comatose survivors of cardiac arrest undergoing therapeutic hypothermia is not well described. METHODS: At this urban level I trauma center, every patient undergoing therapeutic hypothermia is monitored with continuous video encephalography (cvEEG). We abstracted medical records for all cardiac arrest patients treated with therapeutic hypothermia during 2010. Clinical data were extracted in duplicate. cvEEGs were independently reviewed for seizures by two board-certified epileptologists. RESULTS: There were 33 patients treated with therapeutic hypothermia after cardiac arrest in 2010 who met inclusion criteria for this study. Median age was 58 (range 28-86 years), 63% were white, 55% were male, and 9% had a history of seizures or epilepsy. During cooling, seizures occurred in 5/33 patients (15%, 95%CI 6%-33%). 11/33 patients (33%, 95% CI 19%-52%) had seizures at some time during hospitalization. 13/33 (39%) survived to discharge and of these, 7/13 (54%) survived to 30 days. 9/11 patients with seizures died during hospitalization, compared with 11/22 patients without seizures (82% vs. 50%; difference 32%, CI 951%-63%). No patient with seizures was alive at 30 days. CONCLUSIONS: Seizures are common in comatose patients treated with therapeutic hypothermia after cardiac arrest. All patients with seizures were deceased within 30 days of discharge. Routine use of EEG monitoring could assist in early detection of seizures in this patient population, providing an opportunity for intervention to potentially improve outcomes.

The electrocardiogram (ECG) time series of VF is investigated by comparison of the linear and non-linear features of VF time series and surrogates in which internal correlations have been destroyed. From 40 ECG time series of human VF and 40 surrogate time series, three quantities are evaluated: the percentage of the linear time-frequency distribution (TFD) exceeding a threshold, the non-linear coarse-grained correlation dimension (Dcg), and the percentage of diagonal lines in the non-linear recurrence plot longer than 10 elements (D10). It is found that the mean (SD) percent threshold TFD and Dcg are higher for the surrogates (6.7% (1.3) and 5.3 (0.6)) than the VF time series (5.6% (0.7) and 3.8 (0.9)), whereas the mean D10 is higher for the VF time series (49% (13)) than the surrogates (32% (7)). All of these differences are significant (p < 0.0001) and indicate greater order in the VF time series than in the surrogates. It is therefore shown that both linear and non-linear signal analysis demonstrate order in the ECG time series of VF.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Estimation of the infarct size from body-surface ECGs in post-myocardial  infarction patients has become possible using the Selvester scoring method. Automation of this scoring has been proposed in order to speed-up the measurement of the score and improving the inter-observer variability in computing a score that requires strong expertise in electrocardiography. In this work, we evaluated the quality of the QuAReSS software for delivering correct Selvester scoring in a set of standard 12-lead ECGs. METHOD: Standard 12-lead ECGs were recorded in 105 post-MI patients prescribed implantation of an implantable cardiodefibrillator (ICD). Amongst the 105 patients with standard clinical left bundle branch block (LBBB) patterns, 67 had a LBBB pattern meeting the strict criteria. The QuAReSS software was applied to these 67 tracings by two independent groups of cardiologists (from a clinical group and an ECG core laboratory) to measure the Selvester score semi-automatically. Using various level of agreement metrics, we compared the scores between groups and when automatically measured by the software. RESULTS: The average of the absolute difference in Selvester scores measured by the two independent groups was 1.4±1.5 score points, whereas the difference between automatic method and the two manual adjudications were 1.2±1.2 and 1.3±1.2 points. Eighty-two percent score agreement was observed between the two independent measurements when the difference of score was within two point ranges, while 90% and 84% score agreements were reached using the automatic method compared to the two manual adjudications. CONCLUSION: The study confirms that the QuAReSS software provides valid measurements of the Selvester score in patients with strict LBBB with minimal correction from cardiologists.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Wearable devices with photoplethysmography (PPG) technology can be  useful for detecting paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF), which often goes uncaptured despite being a leading cause of stroke. OBJECTIVE: This study is the first part of a 2-phase study that aimed at developing a method for immediate detection of paroxysmal AF using PPG-integrated wearable devices. In this study, the diagnostic performance of 2 major smart watches, Apple Watch Series 3 and Fitbit (FBT) Charge HR Wireless Activity Wristband, each equipped with a PPG sensor, was compared, and the pulse rate data outputted from those devices were analyzed for precision and accuracy in reference to the heart rate data from electrocardiography (ECG) during AF. METHODS: A total of 40 subjects from patients who underwent cardiac surgery at a single center between September 2017 and March 2018 were monitored for postoperative AF using telemetric ECG and PPG devices. AF was diagnosed using a 12-lead ECG by qualified physicians. Each subject was given a pair of smart watches, Apple Watch and FBT, for simultaneous pulse rate monitoring. The heart rate of all subjects was also recorded on the telemetry system. Time series pulse rate trends and heart rate trends were created and analyzed for trend pattern similarities. Those trend data were then used to determine the accuracy of PPG-based pulse rate measurements in reference to ECG-based heart rate measurements during AF. RESULTS: Of the 20 AF events in group FBT, 6 (30%) showed a moderate or higher correlation (cross-correlation function>0.40) between pulse rate trend patterns and heart rate trend patterns. Of the 16 AF events in group Apple Watch (workout [W] mode), 12 (75%) showed a moderate or higher correlation between the 2 trend patterns. Linear regression analyses also showed a significant correlation between the pulse rates and the heart rates during AF in the subjects with Apple Watch. This correlation was not observed with FBT. The regression formula for Apple Watch W mode and FBT was X=14.203 + 0.841Y and X=58.225 + 0.228Y, respectively (where X denotes the mean of all average pulse rates during AF and Y denotes the mean of all corresponding average heart rates during AF), and the coefficient of determination (R(2)) was 0.685 and 0.057, respectively (P<.001 and .29, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: In this validation study, the detection precision of AF and measurement accuracy during AF were both better with Apple Watch W mode than with FBT.

N2  - AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To confirm the accuracy of the EASI system compared to the  standard 12-lead electrocardiogram, which is the gold standard, in monitoring the two major parameters used in the Coronary Care Units to detect myocardial ischaemia: ST-segment and J-point. BACKGROUND: Continuous electrocardiograph monitoring is used in the Coronary Care Units to detect cardiac conduction abnormalities and to show the morphology of electrocardiographic waves and tracts. Its accuracy is essential for efficient nursing vigilance, particularly for monitoring the ST segment and the J-point, in which alterations may indicate the onset of myocardial ischaemia. DESIGN: An observational study was conducted. METHODS: The enrolled patients (n = 253) simultaneously underwent standard electrocardiogram (10 electrodes) and EASI electrocardiogram (five electrodes). Data were collected by the Coronary Care Units nurses. Tests to compare differences in means and medians between the two sets of measurements were performed, and the Bland-Altman plots were used to illustrate their agreement. RESULTS: All 6·072 electrocardiographic leads (3·036 standard and 3·036 EASI) were recorded and analysed. Between the two measurement methods, very small statistically significant differences were found in some leads which are not clinically relevant for both the ST-segment or the J-point. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms that the accuracy of the EASI 12-leadelectrocardiogram, compared to the standard 12-leadelectrocardiogram, which is the gold standard, is acceptable for clinical practice to monitor the two major parameters used in the Coronary Care Units for detecting myocardial ischaemia: ST-segment and J-point. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: The EASI system ensures: (1) ease of use and comfort for patients admitted to Coronary Care Units because it only requires five electrodes; (2) increased efficacy of nursing vigilance in the early detection of changes in ST-segment and J- point measurements.

N2  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: For diagnosis of arrhythmic heart problems,  electrocardiogram (ECG) signals should be recorded and monitored. The long-term signal records obtained are analyzed by expert cardiologists. Devices such as the Holter monitor have limited hardware capabilities. For improved diagnostic capacity, it would be helpful to detect arrhythmic signals automatically. In this study, a novel approach is presented as a candidate solution for these issues. METHODS: A convolutional auto-encoder (CAE) based nonlinear compression structure is implemented to reduce the signal size of arrhythmic beats. Long-short term memory (LSTM) classifiers are employed to automatically recognize arrhythmias using ECG features, which are deeply coded with the CAE network. RESULTS: Based upon the coded ECG signals, both storage requirement and classification time were considerably reduced. In experimental studies conducted with the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database, ECG signals were compressed by an average 0.70% percentage root mean square difference (PRD) rate, and an accuracy of over 99.0% was observed. CONCLUSIONS: One of the significant contributions of this study is that the proposed approach can significantly reduce time duration when using LSTM networks for data analysis. Thus, a novel and effective approach was proposed for both ECG signal compression, and their high-performance automatic recognition, with very low computational cost.

N2  - OBJECTIVE(S): In well-appearing newborns with suspected cardiac ectopy, we sought to  evaluate our practice and test whether initial electrocardiogram (ECG) findings were associated with neonatal arrhythmias (NA). STUDY DESIGN: We identified well-appearing, non-anomalous infants >34 weeks' gestation with suspected ectopy over 3.5 years. NA was defined as ≥10% premature atrial contractions (PAC), ≥5 beats of atrial tachycardia, ≥2% premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), or ≥3 beats of ventricular tachycardia. The unadjusted associations between initial ECG findings and NA are reported. RESULT: Among 126 infants with ECGs and Holters performed, NA was observed in 38 patients (30%) and was similar whether PACs were present or not on the initial ECG (33% vs. no PACs: 29%, p = 0.6). However, NAs were identified more frequently based on the presence of PVCs on the initial ECG (83% vs. 25%, p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: NAs were prevalent and both their etiologies and impact on infants warrant future study.

N2  - Circadian variations of sinus rate (SR) are well described in subjects with normal  sinus node (SN). On the other hand there are no data in literature concerning the SR daily variations in patients with SN dysfunction. In order to clarify this problem we studied the SR circadian variation in healthy subjects (12) and in patients with intermittent bradycardia (11), persistent bradycardia (9) and intermittent 2:1 sino-atrial block (7). Sr was recorded utilizing ECG Holter monitoring. By histograms obtained every 2 h, maximum, modal, and minimum SR were evaluated. Time series were analyzed with a computer program for cosinor method. In the patients with normal SN, circadian periodicity in SR was confirmed with acrophase at 16(26) (Maximum SR), 16(38) (minimum SR) and 16(31) (SR mode), respectively. In patients with intermittent bradycardia a circadian rhythm was detected only in minimum SR (Acrophase: 16(51)) and in SR mode (acrophase: 16(13)). No statistically significant circadian variations of the 3 parameters of SR were observed in patients with both persistent bradycardia and sino-atrial block. These data suggest that: 1. the disappearance of the circadian periodicity is proportional to the severity of SN dysfunction; 2. the patients with intermittent bradycardia show a more normal behavior at low rates than at high ones; 3. the disappearance of circadian rhythm in patients with marked SN dysfunction can be related to the SN intrinsic involvement and/or autonomic nervous system dysfunction.

N2  - StressEraser is a commercially marketed biofeedback device designed to enhance heart  rate variability. StressEraser makes its internal calculations on beat-to-beat measures of finger pulse intervals. However, the accuracy and precision of StressEraser in quantifying interbeat intervals using finger pulse intervals has not been evaluated against standard laboratory equipment using R-R intervals. Accuracy was assessed by simultaneously recording interbeat intervals using StressEraser and a standard laboratory ECG system. The interbeat intervals were highly correlated between the systems. The average deviation in interbeat interval recordings between the systems was approximately 6 ms. Moreover, correlations approached unity between the systems on estimates of heart period, heart rate, and heart rate variability. Feedback from StressEraser is based on an interbeat time series that provides sufficient information to provide an excellent estimate of the dynamic changes in heart rate and heart rate variability. The slight variations between StressEraser and the laboratory equipment in quantifying heart rate and heart rate variability are due to features related to monitoring heart rate with finger pulse: (1) a lack in precision in the peak of the finger pulse relative to the clearly defined inflection point in the R-wave, and (2) contribution of variations in pulse transit time.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Heart rate is the most important indicator of infant well-being during  neonatal resuscitation. The Nellcor Pedi-Cap turns gold when exposed to exhaled gas with CO₂>15 mmHg. The aim of this study was to determine if Pedi-Cap gold color change during neonatal resuscitation precedes an increase in heart rate in babies with bradycardia receiving mask ventilation. METHODS: This was a single-center retrospective review of video recordings and physiologic data of newborns with bradycardia receiving mask positive pressure ventilation during neonatal resuscitation. Subjects were included if the baby's HR<100 BPM within the first 90 s of resuscitation. The primary outcome was the change in HR prior to Pedi-Cap gold color change compared to the HR after Pedi-Cap gold color change. RESULTS: Forty-one newborns during the study period had HR<100 BPM and received mask positive pressure ventilation with a Pedi-Cap. The median heart rate 10s prior to Pedi-Cap gold color change was 75 BPM (IQR 62-85) and increased to 136 BPM (IQR 113-158) 30 s after gold color change (p<0.001). SpO₂ increased from 45 ± 17% prior to Pedi-Cap gold color change to 52 ± 17% 30s after gold color change (p=0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Colorimetric CO₂ detection during mask positive pressure ventilation in neonatal resuscitation precedes a significant increase in heart rate and SpO₂. The Pedi-Cap can be easily applied during resuscitation, requires no electricity, provides immediate feedback and may be a useful, simple tool early in resuscitation and may be especially useful in resource limited settings.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Increased variability of beat-to-beat QT-interval durations on the  electrocardiogram (ECG) has been associated with increased risk for fatal and non-fatal cardiac events. However, techniques for the measurement of QT variability (QTV) have not been validated since a gold standard is not available. In this study, we propose a validation method and illustrate its use for the validation of two automatic QTV measurement techniques. METHODS: Our method generates artificial standard 12-lead ECGs based on the averaged P-QRS-T complexes from a variety of existing ECG signals, with simulated intrinsic (QT interval) and extrinsic (noise, baseline wander, signal length) variations. We quantified QTV by a commonly used measure, short-term QT variability (STV). Using 28,800 simulated ECGs, we assessed the performance of a conventional QTV measurement algorithm, resembling a manual QTV measurement approach, and a more advanced algorithm based on fiducial segment averaging (FSA). RESULTS: The results for the conventional algorithm show considerable median absolute differences between the simulated and estimated STV. For the highest noise level, median differences were 4-6 ms in the absence of QTV. Increasing signal length generally yields more accurate STV estimates, but the difference in performance between 30 or 60 beats is small. The FSA algorithm proved to be very accurate, with most median absolute differences less than 0.5 ms, even for the highest levels of disturbance. CONCLUSIONS: Artificially constructed ECGs with a variety of disturbances allow validation of QTV measurement procedures. The FSA algorithm provides highly accurate STV estimates under varying signal conditions, and performs much better than traditional beat-by-beat analysis. The fully automatic operation of the FSA algorithm enables STV measurement in large sets of ECGs.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Although electrocardiographic monitoring is common in hospitalized  patients, many patients receive unnecessary monitoring, contributing to patients' inconvenience, clinicians' alarm fatigue, and delayed admissions. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of implementation of an electronic order set based on the American Heart Association practice standards for electrocardiographic monitoring on the occurrence of appropriate monitoring. METHODS: The sample for this preintervention-to-postintervention quasi-experimental study consisted of 297 adult patients on medical, surgical, neurological, oncological, and orthopedic patient care units that used remote electrocardiographic monitoring in a 627-bed hospital in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The intervention was the introduction into the electronic health record of order sets prompting physicians to order electrocardiographic monitoring per the American Heart Association practice standards. Indications for monitoring according to the practice standards and adverse outcomes (unexpected transfer to intensive care unit, death, code blue events, and call for the rapid response team) were compared before and after implementation of the order set. RESULTS: Implementation of the order set was associated with an increase in appropriate monitoring (48.0% to 61.2%; P = .03); the largest increase was in ordering by medical residents (30.8% to 76.5%; P = .001). No significant increase in adverse patient outcomes was noted. CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of the practice standards via an electronic order set was associated with a statistically significant increase in appropriate monitoring, with no increase in adverse events. Use of electronic order sets is an effective and safe way to enhance appropriate electrocardiographic monitoring.

N2  - The Linköping burn score has been used for two decades to calculate the cost to the  hospital of each burned patient. Our aim was to validate the Burn Score in a dedicated Burn Centre by analysing the associations with burn-specific factors: percentage of total body surface area burned (TBSA%), cause of injury, patients referred from other (non-specialist) centres, and survival, to find out which of these factors resulted in higher scores. Our second aim was to analyse the variation in scores of each category of care (surveillance, respiration, circulation, wound care, mobilisation, laboratory tests, infusions, and operation). We made a retrospective analysis of all burned patients admitted during the period 2000-15. Multivariable regression models were used to analyse predictive factors for an increased daily burn score, the cumulative burn score (the sum of the daily burn scores for each patient) and the total burn score (total sum of burn scores for the whole group throughout the study period) in addition to sub-analysis of the different categories of care that make up the burn score. We retrieved 22301 daily recordings for inpatients. Mobilisation and care of the wound accounted for more than half of the total burn score during the study. Increased TBSA% and age over 45 years were associated with increased cumulative (model R(2) 0.43, p<0.001) and daily (model R(2) 0.61, p<0.001) burn scores. Patients who died had higher daily burn scores, while the cumulative burn score decreased with shorter duration of hospital stay (p<0.001). To our knowledge this is the first long term analysis and validation of a system for scoring burn interventions in patients with burns that explores its association with the factors important for outcome. Calculations of costs are based on the score, and it provides an indicator of the nurses' workload. It also gives important information about the different dimensions of the care provided from thorough investigation of the scores for each category.

To date, the primary cardiac monitoring focus has been ambulatory ECG (AECG) monitoring. In this setting, AECG monitoring has become a diagnostic tool used daily by physicians of many specialties. In this regard, both wearable and subcutaneous ECG monitoring technologies are now widely available, with the appropriate choice for a given patient being best determined by the frequency with which the patient's symptom recurrences are expected. In other words, the less frequent the symptomatic events, then the longer the monitoring duration requirement should be. However, multiple factors other than the technology used impact success. For example, wearable AECG systems are only capable of monitoring patients for a period of a few days to several weeks due to limited battery longevity, patient intolerance to cutaneous ECG electrodes, the cumbersome nature of the device, or a combination of these factors. Current-generation insertable cardiac monitors (ICMs), on the other hand, offer three years of monitoring and infrequent skin irritation. Additionally, automatic remote download, a valuable feature in many cases, is only offered by certain wearable technologies, but is an option in all currently available ICMs. This report focuses on the current status of subcutaneous ICMs and their indications and limitations. The goal is to highlight the variety of utility of current ICM technologies and to provide insight into potential future subcutaneous ICM applications.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia in clinical  practice and is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Screening for AF in asymptomatic patients has been proposed as a way of reducing the burden of the disease by detecting people who would benefit from prophylactic anticoagulation therapy prior to the onset of symptoms. However, for screening to be an effective intervention it must improve the detection of AF and provide benefit for those who are detected earlier as a result of screening. OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of this review was to examine whether screening programmes increase the detection of new cases of AF compared to routine practice. The secondary objectives were to identify which combination of screening strategy and patient population is most effective, as well as assessing any safety issues associated with screening, its acceptability within the target population and the costs involved. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) on The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (Ovid) and EMBASE (Ovid) up to March 2012. Other relevant research databases, trials registries and websites were searched up to June 2012. Reference lists of identified studies were also searched for potentially relevant studies and we contacted corresponding authors for information about additional published or unpublished studies that may be relevant. No language restrictions were applied. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials, controlled before and after studies and interrupted time series studies comparing screening for AF with routine practice in people aged 40 years and over were eligible. Two authors (PM, CT or MF) independently selected the trials for inclusion. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Assessment of risk of bias and data extraction were performed independently by two authors (PM, CT). Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used to present the results for the primary outcome, which is a dichotomous variable. Since only one included study was identified, no meta-analysis was performed. MAIN RESULTS: One cluster randomised controlled trial met the inclusion criteria for this review. This study compared systematic screening (by invitation to have an electrocardiogram (ECG)) and opportunistic screening (pulse palpation during a general practitioner (GP) consultation for any reason followed by an ECG if pulse was irregular) to routine practice (normal case finding on the basis of clinical presentation) in people aged 65 years or older. The risk of bias in the included study was judged to be low.Both systematic and opportunistic screening of people over the age of 65 years are more effective than routine practice (OR 1.57, 95% CI 1.08 to 2.26 and OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.10 to 2.29, respectively). The number needed to screen in order to detect one additional case compared to routine practice was 172 (95% CI 94 to 927) for systematic screening and 167 (95% CI 92 to 806) for opportunistic screening. Both systematic and opportunistic screening were more effective in men (OR 2.68, 95% CI 1.51 to 4.76 and OR 2.33, 95% CI 1.29 to 4.19, respectively) than in women (OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.62 and OR 1.2, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.93, respectively). No data on the effectiveness of screening in different ethnic or socioeconomic groups were available. There were insufficient data to compare the effectiveness of screening programmes in different healthcare settings.Systematic screening was associated with a better overall uptake rate than opportunistic screening (53% versus 46%) except in the ≥ 75 years age group where uptake rates were similar (43% versus 42%). In both screening programmes men were more likely to participate than women (57% versus 50% in systematic screening, 49% versus 41% in opportunistic screening) and younger people (65 to 74 years) were more likely to participate than people aged 75 years and over (61% versus 43% systematic, 49% versus 42% opportunistic). No adverse events associated with screening were reported.The incremental cost per additional case detected by opportunistic screening was GBP 337, compared to GBP 1514 for systematic screening. All cost estimates were based on data from the single included trial, which was conducted in the UK between 2001 and 2003. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Systematic and opportunistic screening for AF increase the rate of detection of new cases compared with routine practice. While both approaches have a comparable effect on the overall AF diagnosis rate, the cost of systematic screening is significantly more than that of opportunistic screening from the perspective of the health service provider. The lack of studies investigating the effect of screening in other health systems and younger age groups means that caution needs to be exercised in relation to the transferability of these results beyond the setting and population in which the included study was conducted.Additional research is needed to examine the effectiveness of alternative screening strategies and to investigate the effect of the intervention on the risk of stroke for screened versus non-screened populations.

N2  - Most existing, expert monitoring systems do not provide the real time continuous  analysis of the monitored physiological data that is necessary to detect transient or combined vital sign indicators nor do they provide long term storage of the data for retrospective analyses. In this paper we examine the feasibility of implementing a long term data storage system which has the ability to incorporate real-time data analytics, the system design, report the main technical issues encountered, the solutions implemented and the statistics of the data recorded. McLaren Electronic Systems expertise used to continually monitor and analyse the data from F1 racing cars in real time was utilised to implement a similar real-time data recording platform system adapted with real time analytics to suit the requirements of the intensive care environment. We encountered many technical (hardware and software) implementation challenges. However there were many advantages of the system once it was operational. They include: (1) The ability to store the data for long periods of time enabling access to historical physiological data. (2) The ability to alter the time axis to contract or expand periods of interest. (3) The ability to store and review ECG morphology retrospectively. (4) Detailed post event (cardiac/respiratory arrest or other clinically significant deteriorations in patients) data can be reviewed clinically as opposed to trend data providing valuable clinical insight. Informed mortality and morbidity reviews can be conducted. (5) Storage of waveform data capture to use for algorithm development for adaptive early warning systems. Recording data from bed-side monitors in intensive care/wards is feasible. It is possible to set up real time data recording and long term storage systems. These systems in future can be improved with additional patient specific metrics which predict the status of a patient thus paving the way for real time predictive monitoring.

N2  - The aim of this study was to investigate qualitatively and quantitatively non-linear  and linear characteristics of heart rate identifying their connection to sleep states during the first 6 months of life. 16 newborns were examined polygraphically in a longitudinal study (first day, first and sixth month). After R-peak detection of a limb lead ECG and R-R interval calculation, time series of the instantaneous heart rate (IHR) were constructed. They were analyzed qualitatively with regard to the structure of the Poincaré maps and the occurrence of bifurcations as well as quantitatively by calculating the correlation dimension (D2) and the Lyapunov exponent (LLE). In some cases, bifurcations in the IHR time series occurred. The Poincaré maps showed mainly clear structures in the shape of limited point clusters. D2 was in the range of 1.5 to 2.5 and was larger in quiet than in active sleep. LLE was always positive, although higher values in active sleep than in quiet sleep were exhibited in the first month of life only. D2 and LLE values during active sleep were age-dependent. The results of the study indicate a non-linear component in the heart rate control of healthy newborns. The change in D2 and LLE in connection with postnatal age and sleep states expresses a modulation of these system components during the postnatal maturation and during vegetative sleep organisation.

N2  - Electrocardiogram (ECG) anomaly detection is an important technique for detecting  dissimilar heartbeats which helps identify abnormal ECGs before the diagnosis process. Currently available ECG anomaly detection methods, ranging from academic research to commercial ECG machines, still suffer from a high false alarm rate because these methods are not able to differentiate ECG artifacts from real ECG signal, especially, in ECG artifacts that are similar to ECG signals in terms of shape and/or frequency. The problem leads to high vigilance for physicians and misinterpretation risk for nonspecialists. Therefore, this work proposes a novel anomaly detection technique that is highly robust and accurate in the presence of ECG artifacts which can effectively reduce the false alarm rate. Expert knowledge from cardiologists and motif discovery technique is utilized in our design. In addition, every step of the algorithm conforms to the interpretation of cardiologists. Our method can be utilized to both single-lead ECGs and multilead ECGs. Our experiment results on real ECG datasets are interpreted and evaluated by cardiologists. Our proposed algorithm can mostly achieve 100% of accuracy on detection (AoD), sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value with 0% false alarm rate. The results demonstrate that our proposed method is highly accurate and robust to artifacts, compared with competitive anomaly detection methods.

N2  - We developed a simple and fully automated method for detecting artifacts in the R-R  interval (RRI) time series of the ECG that is tailored to the intensive care unit (ICU) setting. From ECG recordings of 50 adult ICU-subjects we selected 60 epochs with valid R-peak detections and 60 epochs containing artifacts leading to missed or false positive R-peak detections. Next, we calculated the absolute value of the difference between two adjacent RRIs (adRRI), and obtained the empirical probability distributions of adRRI values for valid R-peaks and artifacts. From these, we calculated an optimal threshold for separating adRRI values arising from artifact versus non-artefactual data. We compared the performance of our method with the methods of Berntson and Clifford on the same data. We identified 257,458 R-peak detections, of which 235,644 (91.5%) were true detections and 21,814 (8.5%) arose from artifacts. Our method showed superior performance for detecting artifacts with sensitivity 100%, specificity 99%, precision 99%, positive likelihood ratio of 100 and negative likelihood ratio <0.001 compared to Berntson's and Clifford's method with a sensitivity, specificity, precision and positive and negative likelihood ratio of 99%, 78%, 82%, 4.5, 0.013 for Berntson's method and 55%, 98%, 96%, 27.5, 0.460 for Clifford's method, respectively. A novel algorithm using a patient-independent threshold derived from the distribution of adRRI values in ICU ECG data identifies artifacts accurately, and outperforms two other methods in common use. Furthermore, the threshold was calculated based on real data from critically ill patients and the algorithm is easy to implement.

N2  - Heart rate shows a circadian rhythm. This has not yet been sufficiently investigated  for its variability till now, which challenges the analysis of rhythms of the variability and their validity in long time records. For this purpose, time series of heart period duration (HPD) and sinus arrhythmia (SA) were measured in 30 children in a boarding-school (14 male, 16 female, 12 to 14 years of age) from the ECG for 5 min/h during 24 h. Fast Fourier transform provided the spectra and the power density. HPD, SA, power maxima and their frequencies were analyzed for circadian rhythms according to Halberg. Times of meals and sleep were uniform. Power and frequencies of the spectra showed individual patterns, stable throughout the day in 2 diverse groups. SA, high- (HF) and middle frequent (MF) spectral parts show circadian oscillations in frequency or power with acrophases during day or night, often in contrast to HF and MF. This proves the existence of circadian rhythms of heart rate variability for SA, HF and MF. In some cases, the individual 24-h patterns are superimposed by effects of external zeitgeber, e.g. meals.

N2  - Existing arrhythmia classification methods usually use manual selection of  electrocardiogram (ECG) signal features, so that the feature selection is subjective, and the feature extraction is complex, leaving the classification accuracy usually affected. Based on this situation, a new method of arrhythmia automatic classification based on discriminative deep belief networks (DDBNs) is proposed. The morphological features of heart beat signals are automatically extracted from the constructed generative restricted Boltzmann machine (GRBM), then the discriminative restricted Boltzmann machine (DRBM) with feature learning and classification ability is introduced, and arrhythmia classification is performed according to the extracted morphological features and RR interval features. In order to further improve the classification performance of DDBNs, DDBNs are converted to deep neural network (DNN) using the Softmax regression layer for supervised classification in this paper, and the network is fine-tuned by backpropagation. Finally, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Beth Israel Hospital Arrhythmia Database (MIT-BIH AR) is used for experimental verification. For training sets and test sets with consistent data sources, the overall classification accuracy of the method is up to 99.84% ± 0.04%. For training sets and test sets with inconsistent data sources, a small number of training sets are extended by the active learning (AL) method, and the overall classification accuracy of the method is up to 99.31% ± 0.23%. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the method in arrhythmia automatic feature extraction and classification. It provides a new solution for the automatic extraction of ECG signal features and classification for deep learning.

N2  - The electrocardiographic imaging (ECGI) inverse problem highly relies on adding  constraints, a process called regularization, as the problem is ill-posed. When there are no prior information provided about the unknown epicardial potentials, the Tikhonov regularization method seems to be the most commonly used technique. In the Tikhonov approach the weight of the constraints is determined by the regularization parameter. However, the regularization parameter is problem and data dependent, meaning that different numerical models or different clinical data may require different regularization parameters. Then, we need to have as many regularization parameter-choice methods as techniques to validate them. In this work, we addressed this issue by showing that the Discrete Picard Condition (DPC) can guide a good regularization parameter choice for the two-norm Tikhonov method. We also studied the feasibility of two techniques: The U-curve method (not yet used in the cardiac field) and a novel automatic method, called ADPC due its basis on the DPC. Both techniques were tested with simulated and experimental data when using the method of fundamental solutions as a numerical model. Their efficacy was compared with the efficacy of two widely used techniques in the literature, the L-curve and the CRESO methods. These solutions showed the feasibility of the new techniques in the cardiac setting, an improvement of the morphology of the reconstructed epicardial potentials, and in most of the cases of their amplitude.

N2  - The concurrent usage of actigraphy and heart rate variability (HRV) for sleep  efficiency quantification is still matter of investigation. This study compared chest (CACT) and wrist (WACT) actigraphy (actigraphs positioned on chest and wrist, respectively) in combination with HRV for automatic sleep vs wake classification. Accelerometer and ECG signals were collected during polysomnographic studies (PSGs) including 18 individuals (25-53 years old) with no previous history of sleep disorders. Then, an experienced neurologist performed sleep staging on PSG data. Eleven features from HRV and accelerometry were extracted from series of different lengths. A support vector machine (SVM) was used to automatically distinguish sleep and wake. We found 7 min as the optimal signal length for classification, while maximizing specificity (wake detection). CACT and WACT provided similar accuracies (78% chest vs 77% wrist), larger than what yielded by HRV alone (66%). The addition of HRV to CACT reduced slightly the accuracy, while improving specificity (from 33% to 51%, p < 0.05). On the contrary, the concurrent usage of HRV and WACT did not provide statistically significant improvements over WACT. Then, a subset of features (3 from HRV + 1 from actigraphy) was selected by reducing redundancy using a strategy based on Spearman's correlation and area under the ROC curve. The usage of the reduced set of features and SVM classifier gave only slightly reduced classification performances, which did not differ from the full sets of features. The study opens interesting possibilities in the design of wearable devices for long-term monitoring of sleep at home.

N2  - The measures of nonlinear properties of RR interval and QT interval time series are  sensitive to physiologically- or pathologically-induced complexity/regularity changes, but were not used to estimate the effect of alcohol intake. We wanted to examine the potential of these measures to quantify the acute effect of a low dose of red wine in healthy subjects. In separate experiments, fourteen young volunteers drank 200ml of red wine and a control drink with equal concentration of ethanol. ECG in supine position was recorded 20min before and 60min after drink intake. RR interval and QT interval series were extracted from ECG and we calculated variability, scaling exponents (α1 and α2) and sample entropy (SampEn) for both series. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures (BP) were measured every 10min. The immediate effect of both the drinks was equal: HR, BP and QT variability exhibited a sudden increase and then a decrease. However, the prolonged effect of wine and the control drink was different. Wine decreased both BP (p<0.05) and reduced complexity of RR and QT series (increased scaling exponents and decreased SampEn). The control drink prolonged QT and RR intervals (p<0.05). These results point out that the nonlinear properties of RR and QT interval series could be used to differentiate the effect of wine and ethanol. Changes in RR and QT interval series induced by a low dose of red wine are more detectable by methods that quantify the structure of the series than by methods that quantify their variability.

N2  - GOAL: This paper presents a methodology for the automatic detection of sleep apnea  from single-lead ECG. METHODS: It uses two novel features derived from the ECG, and two well-known features in heart rate variability analysis, namely the standard deviation and the serial correlation coefficients of the RR interval time series. The first novel feature uses the principal components of the QRS complexes, and it describes changes in their morphology caused by an increased sympathetic activity during apnea. The second novel feature extracts the information shared between respiration and heart rate using orthogonal subspace projections. Respiratory information is derived from the ECG by means of three state-of-the-art algorithms, which are implemented and compared here. All features are used as input to a least-squares support vector machines classifier, using an RBF kernel. In total, 80 ECG recordings were included in the study. RESULTS: Accuracies of about 85% are achieved on a minute-by-minute basis, for two independent datasets including both hypopneas and apneas together. Separation between apnea and normal recordings is achieved with 100% accuracy. In addition to apnea classification, the proposed methodology determines the contamination level of each ECG minute. CONCLUSION: The performances achieved are comparable with those reported in the literature for fully automated algorithms. SIGNIFICANCE: These results indicate that the use of only ECG sensors can achieve good accuracies in the detection of sleep apnea. Moreover, the contamination level of each ECG segment can be used to automatically detect artefacts, and to highlight segments that require further visual inspection.

N2  - The analysis of the P-wave on surface ECG is widely used to assess the risk of  atrial arrhythmias. In order to provide reliable results, the automatic analysis of the P-wave must be precise and reliable and must take into account technical aspects, one of those being the resolution of the acquisition system. The aim of this note is to investigate the effects of the amplitude resolution of ECG acquisition systems on the P-wave analysis. Starting from ECG recorded by an acquisition system with a less significant bit (LSB) of 31 nV (24 bit on an input range of 524 mVpp), we reproduced an ECG signal as acquired by systems with lower resolution (16, 15, 14, 13 and 12 bit). We found that, when the LSB is of the order of 128 µV (12 bit), a single P-wave is not recognizable on ECG. However, when averaging is applied, a P-wave template can be extracted, apparently suitable for the P-wave analysis. Results obtained in terms of P-wave duration and morphology revealed that the analysis of ECG at lowest resolutions (from 12 to 14 bit, LSB higher than 30 µV) could lead to misleading results. However, the resolution used nowadays in modern electrocardiographs (15 and 16 bit, LSB <10 µV) is sufficient for the reliable analysis of the P-wave.

N2  - This paper presents a wearable electrophysiological interface with enhanced immunity  to motion artifacts. Anti-artifact schemes, including a patch-type modular structure and real-time automatic level adjustment, are proposed and verified in two wireless system prototypes of a patch-type electrocardiogram (ECG) module and an electromyogram (EMG)-based robot-hand controller. Their common ExG readout integrated circuit (ROIC), which is reconfigurable for multiple physiological interfaces, is designed and fabricated in a 0.18 μm CMOS process. Moreover, analog pre-processing structures based on envelope detection are integrated with one another to mitigate signal processing burdens in the digital domain effectively.

N2  - In this study, we aimed to seek for different ways of measuring cardiac stress in  terms of heart rate variability (HRV) and heart rate (HR) dynamics, and to develop a novel index that can effectively summarize the information reflected by these measures to continuously and quantitatively characterize the cardiac stress status during physical exercise. Standard deviation, spectral measure of HRV as well as a nonlinear detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) based fractal-like behavior measure of HR dynamics were all evaluated on the RR time series derived from windowed electrocardiogram (ECG) data for the subjects undergoing cycling exercise. We recruited eleven young healthy subjects in our tests. Each subject was asked to maintain a fixed speed under a constant load during the pedaling test. We obtained the running estimates of the standard deviation of the normal-to-normal interval (SDNN), the high-fidelity power spectral density (PSD) of HRV, and the DFA scaling exponent α, respectively. A trend analysis and a multivariate linear regression analysis of these measures were then performed. Numerical experimental results produced by our analyses showed that a decrease in both SDNN and α was seen during the cycling exercise, while there was no significant correlation between the standard lower frequency to higher frequency (LF-to-HF) spectral power ratio of HRV and the exercise intensity. In addition, while the SDNN and α were both negatively correlated with the Borg rating of perceived exertion (RPE) scale value, it seemed that the LF-to-HF power ratio might not have substantial impact on the Borg value, suggesting that the SDNN and α may be further used as features to detect the cardiac stress status during the physical exercise. We further approached this detection problem by applying a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) to both feature candidates for the task of cardiac stress stratification. As a result, a time-varying parameter, referred to as the cardiac stress measure (CSM), is developed for quantitatively on-line measuring and stratifying cardiac stress status.

N2  - This study proposes a deep learning model that effectively suppresses the false  alarms in the intensive care units (ICUs) without ignoring the true alarms using single- and multi- modal biosignals. Most of the current work in the literature are either rule-based methods, requiring prior knowledge of arrhythmia analysis to build rules, or classical machine learning approaches, depending on hand-engineered features. In this work, we apply convolutional neural networks to automatically extract time-invariant features, an attention mechanism to put more emphasis on the important regions of the segmented input signal(s) that are more likely to contribute to an alarm, and long short-term memory units to capture the temporal information presented in the signal segments. We trained our method efficiently using a two-step training algorithm (i.e., pre-training and fine-tuning the proposed network) on the dataset provided by the PhysioNet computing in cardiology challenge 2015. The evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed method obtains better results compared to other existing algorithms for the false alarm reduction task in ICUs. The proposed method achieves a sensitivity of 93.88% and a specificity of 92.05% for the alarm classification, considering three different signals. In addition, our experiments for 5 separate alarm types leads significant results, where we just consider a single-lead ECG (e.g., a sensitivity of 90.71%, a specificity of 88.30%, an AUC of 89.51 for alarm type of Ventricular Tachycardia arrhythmia).

N2  - Intensive care unit (ICU) experienced and skillful people in this field should be  employed because the equipment, facilities, and admitted patients have more special conditions than other departments. Our goal provides the best quality according to the condition each patient and prevent many unnecessary costs for preventive treatment. In this paper, the proposed system will first receive the patient's vital signs, which are recorded by the ICU monitoring. After the necessary processing, in case of observing changes in the normal state, risk alarms are transmitted to the nursing station so that nurses become aware of this condition and take all equipment to return the patient to normal condition and prevent his death. The applied graph in this study examines patients at any moment and displays the patient's future condition in a schematic manner after precise analyses. In this algorithm, after calculating the R-R intervals in the electrocardiogram signal, RRIs are thrown into a risk plot (RP) by a projectile. Given the amount of projectile RRI, one of the stairs can host that amount. After a few moments by springs embedded under the stairs, the drain of RRIs is done by the kinetic energy stored in the springs towards the valley of life. If the accumulation of quantities in a stair is too much, the spring will not be able to project those RRIs. By examining this situation, we will introduce an index to determine the risk of death for all patients. The results of this paper show that when a person is in normal condition, there is no density in a certain stair and the ball or the projected RRIs are not limited to a stair. In general, the results of this paper show that the lower amount of RRI dispersion in the RP leads to greater risk of entry into the death range and as this amount decrease, an immediate consideration is required. In conclusion, if the precise prediction of the future condition of ICU patients is available to nurses and doctors, more facilities and equipment could be provided to save their lives. •We focused on nonlinear methods with new aspects to extract mentioned dynamics.•This method can reduce the number of ICU nurses and give the special facilities for high-risk patients.•Our results confirm that it is possible to predict mortality based on the dynamical characteristics of HRV.

N2  - The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a key diagnostic tool in heart disease and may serve  to detect ischemia, arrhythmias, and other conditions. Automatic, low cost monitoring of the ECG signal could be used to provide instantaneous analysis in case of symptoms and may trigger the presentation to the emergency department. Currently, since mobile devices (smartphones, tablets) are an integral part of daily life, they could form an ideal basis for automatic and low cost monitoring solution of the ECG signal. In this work, we aim for a realtime classification system for arrhythmia detection that is able to run on Android-based mobile devices. Our analysis is based on 70% of the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia and on 70% of the MIT-BIH Supraventricular Arrhythmia databases. The remaining 30% are reserved for the final evaluation. We detected the R-peaks with a QRS detection algorithm and based on the detected R-peaks, we calculated 16 features (statistical, heartbeat, and template-based). With these features and four different feature subsets we trained 8 classifiers using the Embedded Classification Software Toolbox (ECST) and compared the computational costs for each classification decision and the memory demand for each classifier. We conclude that the C4.5 classifier is best for our two-class classification problem (distinction of normal and abnormal heartbeats) with an accuracy of 91.6%. This classifier still needs a detailed feature selection evaluation. Our next steps are implementing the C4.5 classifier for Android-based mobile devices and evaluating the final system using the remaining 30% of the two used databases.

N2  - Heart rate variability (HRV), analysis gives an insight into the state of the  autonomic nervous system which modulates the cardiac activity. Here a digital signal controller based handy device is developed which acquires the beat to beat time interval, processes it using techniques based on non-linear dynamics, fractal time series analysis, and information theory. The technique employed, that can give reliable results by assessing heart beat signals fetched for a duration of a few minutes, is a huge advantage over the already existing methodologies of assessing cardiac health, those being dependant on the tedious task of acquiring Electro Cardio Gram(ECG) signals, which in turn requires the subject to lie down at a stretch for a couple of hours. The sensor used, relies on the technique of Photoplethysmography, rendering the whole approach as noninvasive. The device designed, calculates parameters like, Largest Lyapunov Exponent, Fractal dimension, Correlation Dimension, Approximate Entropy and α-slope of Poincare plots, which based on the range in which they fall, the cardiac health condition of the subject can be assessed to even the extend of predicting upcoming disorders. The design of heart beat sensor, the technique used in the acquisition of heart beat data, the relevant algorithm developed for the analysis purpose, are presented here.

N2  - Autonomic dysfunction, including baroreceptor attenuation and sympathetic  activation, has been reported in patients with myocardial infarction (MI) and has been associated with increased mortality. We tested the hypotheses that exercise training (ET) in post-MI patients would normalize arterial baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) and muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA), and long-term ET would maintain the benefits in BRS and MSNA. Twenty-eight patients after 1 month of uncomplicated MI were randomly assigned to 2 groups, ET (MI-ET) and untrained. A normal control group was also studied. ET consisted of three 60-minute exercise sessions per week for 6 months. We evaluated MSNA (microneurography), blood pressure (automatic oscillometric method), heart rate (ECG), and spectral analysis of RR interval, systolic arterial pressure (SAP), and MSNA. Baroreflex gain of SAP-RR interval and SAP-MSNA were calculated using the α-index. At 3 to 5 days and 1 month after MI, MSNA and low-frequency SAP were significantly higher and BRS significantly lower in MI patients when compared with the normal control group. ET significantly decreased MSNA (bursts per 100 heartbeats) and the low-frequency component of SAP and significantly increased the low-frequency component of MSNA and BRS of the RR interval and MSNA. These changes were so marked that the differences between patients with MI and the normal control group were no longer observed after ET. MSNA and BRS in the MI-untrained group did not change from baseline over the same time period. ET normalizes BRS, low-frequency SAP, and MSNA in patients with MI. These improvements in autonomic control are maintained by long-term ET. These findings highlight the clinical importance of this nonpharmacological therapy based on ET in the long-term treatment of patients with MI.

N2  - The main purpose of the present work is the definition of a fully automatic  procedure for correlation dimension (D(2)) estimation. In the first part, the procedure for the estimation of the correlation dimension (D(2)) is proposed and tested on various types of mathematical models: chaotic (Lorenz and Henon models), periodical (sinusoidal waves) and stochastic (Gaussian and uniform noise). In all cases, accurate D(2) estimates were obtained. The procedure can detect the presence of multiple scaling regions in the correlation integral function. The connection between the presence of multiple scaling regions and multiple dynamic activities cooperating in a system is investigated through the study of composite time series. In the second part of the paper, the proposed algorithm is applied to the study of cardiac electrical activity through the analysis of electrocardiographic signals (ECG) obtained from the commercially available MIT-BIH ECG arrhythmia database. Three groups of ECG signals have been considered: the ECGs of normal subjects and ECGs of subjects with atrial fibrillation and with premature ventricular contraction. D(2) estimates are computed on single ECG intervals (static analysis) of appropriate duration, striking a balance between stationarity requisites and accurate computation requirements. In addition, D(2) temporal variability is studied by analyzing consecutive intervals of ECG tracings (dynamic analysis). The procedure reveals the presence of multiple scaling regions in many ECG signals, and the D(2) temporal variability differs in the three ECG groups considered; it is greater in the case of atrial fibrillation than in normal sinus rhythms. This study points out the importance of considering both the static and dynamic D(2) analysis for a more complete study of the system under analysis. While the static analysis visualizes the underlying heart activity, dynamic D(2) analysis insights the time evolution of the underlying system.

N2  - The aim of the present study was to investigate the X-ray absorption dose and  clinical applications of electrocardiogram (ECG)-gated automatic tube current modulation (ATCM) technology in prospective sequential computed tomography coronary angiography (CTCA) scans of overweight patients. A total of 40 patients with a body mass index of >24 were divided at random into groups A and B. Group A consisted of 20 patients, who were examined using ECG-ATCM scanning. For the patients in group A with heart rates <70 bpm, the scanning range was 20-80% of the R-R interval and the patients received full-dose X-rays for 60-80% of the R-R interval. For the group A patients with heart rates >70 bpm, the scanning range was 20-80% of the R-R interval and the patients received full-dose scanning for 35-55% of the R-R interval. For the 20 patients in group B, the scanning range was 20-80% of the R-R interval and patients received a full dose of X-ray radiation for the entire scanning period. The image quality and radiation dose was compared between the two groups. The average radiation dose in groups A and B was 6.91±2.78 and 10.43±3.36, respectively. The radiation doses in group A were reduced by 33.77% when compared with group B (P<0.05). However, there was no marked difference observed in image quality. In summary, using ECG-ATCM technology in prospective sequential CTCA scanning may significantly reduce the radiation dose required for overweight patients.

N2  - The acceleration and deceleration patterns in heartbeat fluctuations distribute  asymmetrically, which is known as heart rate asymmetry (HRA). It is hypothesized that HRA reflects the balancing regulation of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. This study was designed to examine whether altered autonomic balance during exercise can lead to HRA changes. Sixteen healthy college students were enrolled, and each student undertook two 5-min ECG measurements: one in a resting seated position and another while walking on a treadmill at a regular speed of 5 km/h. The two measurements were conducted in a randomized order, and a 30-min rest was required between them. RR interval time series were extracted from the 5-min ECG data, and HRA (short-term) was estimated using four established metrics, that is, Porta's index (PI), Guzik's index (GI), slope index (SI), and area index (AI), from both raw RR interval time series and the time series after wavelet detrending that removes the low-frequency component of <~0.03 Hz. Our pilot data showed a reduced PI but unchanged GI, SI, and AI during walking compared to resting seated position based on the raw data. Based on the wavelet-detrended data, reduced PI, SI, and AI were observed while GI still showed no significant changes. The reduced PI during walking based on both raw and detrended data which suggests less short-term HRA may underline the belief that vagal tone is withdrawn during low-intensity exercise. GI may not be sensitive to short-term HRA. The reduced SI and AI based on detrended data suggest that they may capture both short- and long-term HRA features and that the expected change in short-term HRA is amplified after removing the trend that is supposed to link to long-term component. Further studies with more subjects and longer measurements are warranted to validate our observations and to examine these additional hypotheses.

N2  - The normal heart beat intervals are neither strictly stationary nor completely  random, and continuously shift from one period to another. Decoding the ECG identifies this "hidden" information that imparts inherent complexity to the heart-beating interval time series. Loss of this complexity in cardiovascular disease is manifested as a reduction in heart rate variability (HRV) and this reduction correlates with an increase in both morbidity and mortality. Because HRV measurements are noninvasive and easy to perform, they have emerged as an important tool in cardiology. However, the identities of specific mechanisms that underline the changes in HRV that occur in cardiovascular diseases remain largely unknown. Changes in HRV have mainly been interpreted on a neural basis, ie due to changes in autonomic impulses to the heart: sympathetic activity decreases both the average heart beat interval and HRV, and parasympathetic activity increases both. It has now become clear, however, that the heart rate and HRV are also determined by intrinsic properties of the pacemaker cells that comprise the sinoatrial node, and the responses of these properties to autonomic receptor stimulation. Here we review how changes in the properties of coupled-clock mechanisms intrinsic to pacemaker cells that comprise the sinoatrial node and their impaired response to autonomic receptor stimulation are implicated in the changes of HRV observed in heart diseases.

N2  - Since the development of coronary care units (CCUs), telemetry has rapidly become  the standard of care in evaluating patients with suspected acute coronary syndromes, regardless of the probability for ischemia. However, there is no data to support this practice. Our objective was to evaluate the utility of routine cardiac monitoring in a chest pain observation unit. We prospectively studied the utility of routine cardiac monitoring in 249 consecutive patients admitted to an observation unit in an academic Emergency Department over a 6-month period. All the patients presented with chest pain thought to be cardiac ischemia. Observation included serial cardiac enzymes, ECG cardiac monitoring, and exercise testing in a designated chest pain observation unit. These patients were determined to be at low risk for an acute coronary event by two criteria: first, the symptoms had resolved by the time of observation unit admission, and second, the initial ECG was normal, unchanged or non-diagnostic for acute ischemia. Adverse outcomes included cardiac arrest, hospital admission secondary to cardiac dysrhythmia, or alteration in the patient's medical therapy upon discharge from the observation unit, secondary to cardiac dysrhythmia. There were 249 patients included with a median age of 52 with 60% women. Fifteen percent of the patients were, subsequently, admitted to the hospital for further evaluation of ischemia based on enzyme, ECG, and exercise testing results. One patient with known Tachy-Brady syndrome was noted to have 1.5-2 s pauses while sleeping, and discharged with instructions to hold beta blocker therapy pending results of a continuous loop recorder. Of the remaining 248 patients, no patient suffered a cardiac arrest, no patient was admitted to the hospital secondary to cardiac dysrhythmia, and no alteration in a patient's medical therapy was made secondary to cardiac dysrhythmia. No patient returned to the Emergency Department within 72 h with cardiac arrest, acute dysrhythmia or acute myocardial infarction. Although telemetry may be the standard of care in evaluating the patients with suspected acute coronary syndromes, regardless of the probability of an acute ischemic syndrome, in those patients with a normal or non diagnostic ECG and resolved symptoms, routine cardiac monitoring is unnecessary.

N2  - Although multiple intraoperative cerebral blood flow (CBF) monitoring techniques are  currently available, a quantitative method that allows for continuous monitoring and that can be easily integrated into the surgical workflow is still needed. Laser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI) is an optical imaging technique with a high spatiotemporal resolution that has been recently demonstrated as feasible and effective for intraoperative monitoring of CBF during neurosurgical procedures. This study demonstrates the impact of retrospective motion correction on the quantitative analysis of intraoperatively acquired LSCI images. LSCI images were acquired through a surgical microscope during brain tumor resection procedures from 10 patients under baseline conditions and after a cortical stimulation in three of those patients. The patient's electrocardiogram (ECG) was recorded during acquisition for postprocess correction of pulsatile artifacts. Automatic image registration was retrospectively performed to correct for tissue motion artifacts, and the performance of rigid and nonrigid transformations was compared. In baseline cases, the original images had [Formula: see text] noise across 16 regions of interest (ROIs). ECG filtering moderately reduced the noise to [Formula: see text], while image registration resulted in a further noise reduction of [Formula: see text]. Combined ECG filtering and image registration significantly reduced the noise to [Formula: see text] ([Formula: see text]). Using the combined motion correction, accuracy and sensitivity to small changes in CBF were improved in cortical stimulation cases. There was also excellent agreement between rigid and nonrigid registration methods (15/16 ROIs with [Formula: see text] difference). Results from this study demonstrate the importance of motion correction for improved visualization of CBF changes in clinical LSCI images.

N2  - Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is a sleep disorder that affects a large  part of the population and the development of algorithms using cardiovascular features for OSAS monitoring has been an extensively researched topic in the last two decades. Several studies regarding automatic apneic event classification using ECG derived features are based on the public Apnea-ECG database available on PhysioNet. Although this database is an excellent starting point for apnea topic investigations, in our study we show that algorithms for apneic-epochs classification that are successfully trained on this database (sensitivity < 85%, false detection rate <20%) perform poorly (sensitivity\textit<55%, false detection rate < 40%) in other databases which include patients with a broader spectrum of apneic events and sleep disorders. The reduced performance can be related to the complexity of breathing events, the increased number of non-breathing related sleep events, and the presence of non-OSAS sleep pathologies.

N2  - BACKGROUND: It has long been suggested that reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a  role in oxygen sensing via peripheral chemoreceptors, which would imply their involvement in chemoreflex activation and autonomic regulation of heart rate. We hypothesize that antioxidant affect neurogenic cardiovascular regulation through activation of chemoreflex which results in increased control of sympathetic mechanism regulating heart rhythm. Activity of xanthine oxidase (XO), which is among the major endogenous sources of ROS in the rat has been shown to increase during hypoxia promote oxidative stress. However, the mechanism of how XO inhibition affects neurogenic regulation of heart rhythm is still unclear. AIM: The study aimed to evaluate effects of allopurinol-driven inhibition of XO on autonomic heart regulation in rats exposed to hypoxia followed by hyperoxia, using heart rate variability (HRV) analysis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 16 conscious male Wistar rats (350 g): control-untreated (N = 8) and pretreated with Allopurinol-XO inhibitor (5 mg/kg, followed by 50 mg/kg), administered intraperitoneally (N = 8), were exposed to controlled hypobaric hypoxia (1h) in order to activate chemoreflex. The treatment was followed by 1h hyperoxia (chemoreflex suppression). Time-series of 1024 RR-intervals were extracted from 4kHz ECG recording for heart rate variability (HRV) analysis in order to calculate the following time-domain parameters: mean RR interval (RRi), SDNN (standard deviation of all normal NN intervals), rMSSD (square root of the mean of the squares of differences between adjacent NN intervals), frequency-domain parameters (FFT method): TSP (total spectral power) as well as low and high frequency band powers (LF and HF). At the end of experiment we used rat plasma to evaluate enzymatic activity of XO and markers of oxidative stress: protein carbonyl group and 8-isoprostane concentrations. Enzymatic activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) were measures in erythrocyte lysates. RESULTS: Allopurinol reduced oxidative stress which was the result of hypoxia/hyperoxia, as shown by decreased 8-isoprostane plasma concentration. XO inhibition did not markedly influence HRV parameters in standard normoxia. However, during hypoxia, as well as hyperoxia, allopurinol administration resulted in a significant increase of autonomic control upon the heart as shown by increased SDNN and TSP, with an increased vagal contribution (increased rMSSD and HF), whereas sympathovagal indexes (LF/HF, SDNN/rMSSD) remained unchanged. CONCLUSIONS: Observed regulatory effects of XO inhibition did not confirm preliminary hypothesis which suggested that an antioxidant such as allopurinol might activate chemoreflex resulting in augmented sympathetic discharge to the heart. The HRV regulatory profile of XO inhibition observed during hypoxia as well as post-hypoxic hyperoxia corresponds to reported reduced risk of sudden cardiovascular events. Therefore our data provide a new argument for therapeutical use of allopurinol in hypoxic conditions.

N2  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Electrocardiogram (ECG) is an important diagnostic tool  for the diagnosis of heart disorders. Useful features and well-designed classification method are crucial for automatic diagnosis. However, most of the contributions were in single lead or two-lead ECG signal and only features from single lead were used to classify the ECG beats. In this paper, a cascaded classification system is proposed to extract features and classify heartbeats in order to improve the performance of ECG beat classification via multi-lead ECG. METHODS: In contrast with most of the literatures, ten signal features were chosen and run on each of the 12 leads separately. Based on these features, we developed a novel feature fusion method combining information from all available leads, and then implemented a cascaded classifier utilizing random forest (RF) and multilayer perceptron (MLP). Besides, in order to reduce the feature space dimension, principal component analysis (PCA) was applied in the method. MATERIALS: Four open source databases including MIT-BIH Arrythmia Database, QT Database, MIT-BIH Supraventricular Arrhythmia Database and St. Petersburg Institute of Cardiological Technics 12-lead Arrhythmia Database (INCART Database) were used in this work. These four databases are different in classes of beats, volume of dataset, number of individual volunteers. Except INCART database, in which the recording format is 12-lead, the other three databases consist of 2-lead recordings. Above all, they all have annotations for every single beat including the type of each beat. CONCLUSIONS: Extensive experimental results shown that the average accuracy achieved 99.3%, 99.8%, 97.6% and 99.6% on four databases respectively. Compared with most state-of-the-art methods, our work has better performance and strong generalization capability.

N2  - In this work, we analyze brain-heart interactions during different mental states  computing mutual information (MI) between the dynamic activity of different physiological systems. In 18 healthy subjects monitored in a relaxed resting state and during a mental arithmetic and a serious game task, multichannel EEG, one lead ECG, respiration and blood volume pulse were collected via wireless non-invasive biosensors. From these signals, synchronous 300-second time series were extracted measuring brain activity via the δ, θ, α, and β EEG power, and activity of the body district via the ECG R-R interval η, the respiratory amplitude ρ and the pulse arrival time π. MI was computed using a linear estimator: (i) between {η,ρ,π} and {δ,θ,α,β}, to measure overall brain-body interactions; (ii) between each time series and the others of the same district, to measure information shared within a district; and (iii) between each time series of a district and all series of the other district, to evaluate individual contributions to the information shared between brain and body. Results document the existence of statistically significant brain-body interactions, with high MI values involving mainly the η body dynamics and the δ and β brain dynamics. State-dependent variations were mostly relevant to the MI of the brain system involving δ, θ, α during mental arithmetic, and α and β during serious game. Thus, MI can be useful to detect correlated activity within and between brain and body systems monitored simultaneously during different mental states.

N2  - The aim of this paper was to study interactions between R-R intervals and  respiratory phases in healthy children during night-time sleep using a novel technique based on joint symbolic dynamics. We investigated overnight polysomnography data of 40 healthy children. The R-R time series were extracted from electrocardiograms (ECG) and respiratory phases were obtained from abdominal sensors using the Hilbert transform. Both the series were transformed into ternary symbol vectors based on the changes between two successive R-R intervals or respiratory phases, respectively. Subsequently, words of length '2' were formed and the correspondence between words of the two series for each sleep stage was determined to quantify cardio-respiratory interaction. We found a significantly higher percentage of similarity in the joint symbolic dynamics of R-R intervals and respiratory phases during slow-wave (SW) sleep compared to any other sleep stage. There was, however, no significant effect of age, gender or BMI on cardio-respiratory interaction. In conclusion, joint symbolic dynamics provides a novel efficient technique for the analysis of cardio-respiratory interaction.

N2  - Heart disease classification based on electrocardiogram(ECG) signal has become a  priority topic in the diagnosis of heart diseases because it can be obtained with a simple diagnostic tool of low cost. Since early detection of heart disease can enable us to ease the treatment as well as save people's lives, accurate detection of heart disease using ECG is very important. In this paper, we propose a classification method of heart diseases based on ECG by adopting a machine learning method, called Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), which is a state-of-the-art technique analyzing time series sequences in deep learning. As suitable data preprocessing, we also utilize symbolic aggregate approximation (SAX) to improve the accuracy. Our experiment results show that our approach not only achieves significantly better accuracy but also classifies heart diseases correctly in smaller response time than baseline techniques.

N2  - Rapid ventricular pacing rates induces two types of beats following pacing  cessation: recovery cycle length (RCL) prolongation (overdrive suppression) and RCL shortening (overdrive excitation). The goals of this study were to compare common experimental protocols for studying triggered activity in whole-heart preparations and differentiate between recovery beats using a new methodology. Post-pacing recovery beat cycle length (RCL) and QRS were normalized to pre-paced R-R and QRS intervals and analyzed using a K-means clustering algorithm. Control hearts only produced suppressed beats: RCL ratio increased with rapid pacing (25 ± 4.0%, n = 10) without changing QRS duration. Rapid pacing during hypercalcemia + hypothermia (5.5 mM and 34°C) produced significantly earlier excited beats (53 ± 14%, n = 5) with wider QRS durations (58 ± 6.3%, n = 5) than suppressed beats. Digoxin + hypothermia (0.75 μM) produced the most excited beats with significantly earlier RCL (44 ± 3.2%, n = 6) and wider QRS (60 ± 3.1%, n = 6) ratios relative to suppressed beats. Increasing pacing further shortened RCL (30 ± 7.8%, n = 6). In a prospective study, TTX (100 nM) increased RCL ratio (15 ± 6.0%, n = 10) without changing the QRS duration of excited beats. The algorithm was compared to a cross-correlation analysis with 93% sensitivity and 94% specificity. This ECG based algorithm distinguishes between triggered and automatic activity.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: In this paper, the contribution of distance-based features to automatic  sleep stage classification is investigated. The potency of these features is analyzed individually and in combination with 48 conventionally used features. METHODS: The distance-based set consists of 32 features extracted by calculating Itakura, Itakura-Saito and COSH distances of autoregressive and spectral coefficients of Electrocardiography (EEG) (C(3)-A(2)), Left EOG, Chin EMG and ECG signals. All the evaluations are performed on three feature sets: distance-based, conventional and total (combined distance based and conventional). Six ranking methods were used to find the top features with the highest discrimination ability in each set. The ranked feature lists were evaluated using k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Decision-tree-based multi-SVM (DSVM) classifiers for five sleep stages including Wake, REM, N1, N2 and N3. Furthermore, the ability of distance-based and conventional features to discriminate between each pair of sleep stages was evaluated using t-test, a hypothesis testing method. RESULTS: Distance-based features occupied 25% of top-ranked features. Simulation results showed that using distance-based features together with conventional features can lead to an enhancement of accuracy. The best classification accuracy (85.5%) was achieved by DSVM classifier and 13 features selected by mRMR-MID and normalized with Min-Max method for total feature set, where two of them were from the distance-based feature set. The t-test results show that distance-based features outperform conventional features in discriminating between N1 and REM stages that is usually a challenge for classification systems. CONCLUSION: Distance-based features have a positive contribution to sleep stage classification, including enhancement of accuracy and better REM-N1 discrimination ability. SIGNIFICANCE: The main motivation for this work was to evaluate new features to characterize each sleep stage in such a way that extracted features were more powerful than conventional features, to distinguish sleep stages from each other, and to improve classifiers accuracy.

N2  - The heart rate variability (HRV) signal derived from the ECG is a beat-to-beat  record of RR intervals and is, as a time series, irregularly sampled. It is common engineering practice to resample this record, typically at 4 Hz, onto a regular time axis for analysis in advance of time domain filtering and spectral analysis based on the DFT. However, it is recognised that resampling introduces noise and frequency bias. The present work describes the implementation of a time-varying filter using a smoothing priors approach based on a Gaussian process model, which does not require data to be regular in time. Its output is directly compatible with the Lomb-Scargle algorithm for power density estimation. A web-based demonstration is available over the Internet for exemplar data. The MATLAB (MathWorks Inc.) code can be downloaded as open source.

N2  - BACKGROUND: There is scarcity of data on atrial fibrillation (AF) prevalence and  outcomes in critically ill patients admitted to the non-cardiac Intensive Care Unit (ICU). AIM: The purpose of our study was to prospectively assess the incidence, risk factors and prognosis of new onset atrial fibrillation in a medical non-cardiac ICU population. METHODS: A prospective single center observational study was conducted in an 8-bed adult Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU). The patients at the MICU were continuously monitored throughout their stay, once an irregularly irregular rhythm was recorded, a confirmative 12-leads ECG was performed and the incidence, duration of the atrial fibrillation and clinical signs of the patient were logged into the computerized patient file. RESULTS: A total of 209 patients were included in the study; 23 of these patients developed AF during the hospital stay. Out of the 209 patients, 26% died during the period of hospitalization. There were a few significant differences between the AF group and the non-AF group including age (67 vs. 49, p < 0.001), proportion of Arab Bedouins (4% vs. 28%, p = 0.01), prevalence of coronary heart disease (39% vs. 10%, p < 0.001), paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (52% vs. 3%, p < 0.001), hypertension (70% vs. 31%, p < 0.001 and dyslipidemia 166% vs. 24%, p < 0.001). The APACHE II scores were similar in both groups. In the AF group, there were more patients with sepsis at admission compared with the non-AF group. Age, length of stay, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) and dyslipidemia were independent factors for the AF development. AF occurrence adjusted for APACHE-II score was not a significant predictor of death during hospitalization (OR = 1.55, p = 0.38). CONCLUSIONS: The development of AF is more prevalent in patients with PAF. Development of AF was not found to be an independent mortality risk factor.

N2  - Quantitative analysis of cardiac arrhythmias has been the subject of intensive  research during the last 10 years. Several systems have been designed to help in the processing of cardiac signals: single or multiple lead electrocardiograms (ECG), electrograms from intracardiac catheters, esophageal recordings, etc. The main objective of these developments was oriented toward positive identification of arrhythmias or rhythm-disturbance counts to imitate the cardiologist's interpretation in contexts such as routing ECG and ambulatory recordings. However, these systems were mainly measurement tools aimed at extracting auricular and ventricular depolarization timings plus gross morphology description. The domain of morphology analysis of beat-to-beat auricular depolarization on ECG has never been highly active due to poor signal conditions. For routine ECG, automatic interpretation was set as an objective to complement computer-assisted ECG interpretation of conduction problems (i.e., morphology analysis of a representative beat extracted or averaged from the dominant rhythm). The limitations of rhythm interpretation in this context are well known. In the ambulatory ECG context, the analysis procedures are relatively simple and are often summarized as trivial counts describing, most exclusively, the ventricular arrhythmic behavior of the heart over a relatively long duration. Waveform-detection and measurement have been the bottleneck of advancement in arrhythmia analysis since highly reliable detection of events on a beat-to-beat basis are necessary to perform a valid analysis. Rare approaches have proposed probabilistic definition of event detection. The present review puts emphasis on the potential of several methods which have been demonstrated as powerful in identifying short- or long-duration heartbeat patterns, mode of heartbeat initiation, mode of heartbeat coupling, etc. Globally, these methods are referred to as time series analysis, modeling of rhythm patterns, simulation, and pattern recognition. A delay in the advancement of the study of arrhythmogenesis and limiting the analysis of arrhythmias to textbook descriptions is not justified when put in perspective of the potential of implementing powerful techniques which have been more or less neglected or used in a narrow way.

N2  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Electrocardiogram (ECG) is one of the most important tools  for assessing cardiac function and detecting potential heart problems. However, most of the current ECG report records remain on the paper, which makes it difficult to preserve and analyze the data. Moreover, paper records could result in the loss significant data, which brings inconvenience to the subsequent clinical diagnosis or artificial intelligence-assisted heart health diagnosis. Taking digital pictures is an intuitive way of preserving these files and can be done simply using smartphones or any other devices with cameras. However, these real scene ECG images often have some image noise that hinders signal extraction. How to eliminate image noise and extract ECG binary image automatically from the noisy and low-quality real scene images of ECG reports is the first problem to be solved in this paper. Next, QRS recognition is implemented on the extracted binary images to determine key points of ECG signals. 1D digital ECG signal is also extracted for accessing the exact values of the extracted points. In light of these tasks, an automatic digital ECG signal extraction and normal QRS recognition from real scene ECG images is proposed in this paper. METHODS: The normal QRS recognition approach for real scene ECG images in this paper consists of two steps: ECG binary image extraction from ECG images using a new two-layer hierarchical method, and the subsequent QRS recognition based on a novel feature-fusing method. ECG binary image extraction is implemented using sub-channel filters followed by an adaptive filtering algorithm. According to the ratio between pixel and real value of ECG binary image, 1D digital ECG signal is obtained. The normal QRS recognition includes three main steps: establishment of candidate point sets, feature fusion extraction, and QRS recognition. Two datasets are introduced for evaluation including a real scene ECG images dataset and the public Non-Invasive Fetal Electrocardiogram Database (FECG). RESULTS: Through the experiment on real scene ECG image, the F(1) score for Q, R, S detection is 0.841, 0.992, and 0.891, respectively. The evaluation on the public FECG dataset also proves the robustness of our algorithm, where F(1) score for R is 0.992 (0.996 for thoracic lead) and 0.988 for thoracic S wave. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed method in this article is a promising tool for automatically extracting digital ECG signals and detecting QRS complex in real scene ECG images with normal QRS.

N2  - Analysis of biomedical signals can yield invaluable information for prognosis,  diagnosis, therapy evaluation, risk assessment, and disease prevention which is often recorded as short time series data that challenges existing complexity classification algorithms such as Shannon entropy (SE) and other techniques. The purpose of this study was to improve previously developed multiscale entropy (MSE) technique by incorporating nearest-neighbor moving-average kernel, which can be used for analysis of nonlinear and non-stationary short time series physiological data. The approach was tested for robustness with respect to noise analysis using simulated sinusoidal and ECG waveforms. Feasibility of MSE to discriminate between normal sinus rhythm (NSR) and atrial fibrillation (AF) was tested on a single-lead ECG. In addition, the MSE algorithm was applied to identify pivot points of rotors that were induced in ex vivo isolated rabbit hearts. The improved MSE technique robustly estimated the complexity of the signal compared to that of SE with various noises, discriminated NSR and AF on single-lead ECG, and precisely identified the pivot points of ex vivo rotors by providing better contrast between the rotor core and the peripheral region. The improved MSE technique can provide efficient complexity analysis of variety of nonlinear and nonstationary short-time biomedical signals.

N2  - The thin skin of preterm babies is easily damaged by adhesive electrodes, tapes,  chest drains and needle-marks. The scars caused could be disfiguring or disabling to 10% of preterm newborns. Capacitive sensors present an attractive option for pervasively monitoring neonatal ECG, and can be embedded in a support system or even a garment worn by the neonate. This could improve comfort and reduce pain aiding better recovery as well as avoiding the scars caused by adhesive electrodes. In this work, we investigate the use of an array of capacitive sensors unobtrusively embedded in a mattress and used in a clinical environment for 15 preterm neonates. We also describe the analysis framework including the fusion of information from all sensors to provide a more accurate ECG signal. We propose a channel selection strategy as well as a method using physiological information to obtain a reliable ECG signal. When sensor coverage is well attained, results for both instantaneous heart rate and ECG signal shape analysis are very encouraging. The study also provides several insights on important factors affecting the results. These include the effect of textile type, number of layers, interferences (e.g. people walking by), motion severity and interventions. Incorporating this knowledge in the design of a capacitive sensing system would be crucial in ensuring that these sensors provide a reliable ECG signal when embedded in a neonatal support system.

N2  - We propose a set of algorithms for sequentially removing artifacts related to MRI  gradient switching and cardiac pulsations from electroencephalography (EEG) data recorded during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Special emphasis is directed upon the use of statistical metrics and methods for the extraction and selection of features that characterize gradient and pulse artifacts. To remove gradient artifacts, we use channel-wise filtering based on singular value decomposition (SVD). To remove pulse artifacts, we first decompose data into temporally independent components and then select a compact cluster of components that possess sustained high mutual information with the electrocardiogram (ECG). After the removal of these components, the time courses of remaining components are filtered by SVD to remove the temporal patterns phase-locked to the cardiac timing markers derived from the ECG. The filtered component time courses are then inversely transformed into multi-channel EEG time series free of pulse artifacts. Evaluation based on a large set of simultaneous EEG-fMRI data obtained during a variety of behavioral tasks, sensory stimulations and resting conditions showed excellent data quality and robust performance attainable with the proposed methods. These algorithms have been implemented as a Matlab-based toolbox made freely available for public access and research use.

N2  - AIM: Aim of the study was to compare the diagnostic yield of implantable loop  recorders (ILR) of two successive generations for the assessment of syncope. METHODS: Data on patients who had undergone ILR implantation for unexplained syncope in four Italian public hospitals were retrospectively acquired from the Medtronic Clinical Service database. After implantation, routine follow-up examinations were performed every 90 days, while urgent examinations were carried out in the event of syncope recurrence. RESULTS: The following findings were regarded as diagnostic: ECG documentation of a syncope recurrence; documentation of any of the arrhythmias listed by the current guidelines as diagnostic findings even if asymptomatic. Between November 2002 and March 2010, 107 patients received an ILR (40 Medtronic Reveal® Plus; 67 Medtronic Reveal® DX/XT) and underwent at least one follow-up examination. Diagnoses were made in 7 (17.5%) and 24 (35.8%) (P=0.043) patients, with a median time of 228 and 65 days, respectively. Three (42.9%) and 21 (87.5%) (P=0.029) diagnoses were based on automatically detected events, while adverse outcomes occurred in 6 and in 1 (P=0.01) patients, respectively. CONCLUSION: Our results show that the new-generation device offer a higher diagnostic yield, mainly as a result of its improved automatic detection function, and is associated with fewer adverse outcomes.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a growing problem internationally and a  recognised cause of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The London borough of Hounslow has a lower than expected prevalence of AF, suggesting poor detection and associated undertreatment. To improve AF diagnosis and management, a quality improvement (QI) initiative was set up in 48 general practices in Hounslow. We aimed to study whether there was evidence of a change in AF diagnosis and management in Hounslow following implementation of interventions in this QI initiative. METHODS: Using the general practice information system (SystmOne), data were retrospectively collected for 415 626 patients, who were actively registered at a Hounslow practice between 1 January 2011 and 31 August 2018. Process, outcome and balancing measures were analysed using statistical process control and interrupted time series regression methods. The baseline period was from 1 January 2011 to 30 September 2014 and the intervention period was from 1 October 2014 to 31 August 2018. RESULTS: When comparing the baseline to the intervention period, (1) the rate of new AF diagnoses increased by 27% (relative risk 1.27; 95% CI 1.05 to 1.52; p<0.01); (2) ECG tests done for patients aged 60 and above increased; (3) CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc and HAS-BLED risk assessments within 30 days of AF diagnosis increased from 1.7% to 19% and 0.2% to 8.1%, respectively; (4) among those at higher risk of stroke, anticoagulation prescription within 30 days of AF diagnosis increased from 31% to 63% while prescription of antiplatelet monotherapy within the same time period decreased from 17% to 7.1%; and (5) average CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc and HAS-BLED risk scores did not change. CONCLUSION: Implementation of interventions in the Hounslow QI initiative coincided with improved AF diagnosis and management. Areas with perceived underdetection of AF should consider similar interventions and methodology.

N2  - The aim of this work was to evaluate the short-term fractal index (α(1) ) of heart  rate variability (HRV) in chronic renal failure (CRF) patients by identifying the effects of orthostatism and hemodialysis (HD), and by evaluating the correlation between α(1) and the mean RR interval from sinus beats (meanNN). HRV time series were derived from ECG data of 19 CRF patients and 20 age-matched healthy subjects obtained at supine and orthostatic positions (lasting 5 min each). Data from CRF patients were collected before and after HD. α(1) was calculated from each time series and compared by analysis of variance. Pearson's correlations between meanNN and α(1) were calculated using the data from both positions by considering three groups: healthy subjects, CRF before HD and CRF after HD. At supine position, α(1) of CRF patients after HD (1.17 ± 0.30) was larger (P < 0.05) than in healthy subjects (0.89 ± 0.28) but not before HD (1.10 ± 0.34). α(1) increased (P < 0.05) in response to orthostatism in healthy subjects (1.29 ± 0.26) and CRF patients after HD (1.34 ± 0.31), but not before HD (1.25 ± 0.37). Whereas α(1) was correlated (P < 0.05) with the meanNN of healthy subjects (r = -0.562) and CRF patients after HD (r = -0.388), no significance in CRF patients before HD was identified (r = 0.003). Multiple regression analysis confirmed that α(1) was mainly predicted by the orthostatic position (in all groups) and meanNN (healthy subjects and patients after HD), showing no association with the renal disease condition in itself. In conclusion, as in healthy subjects, α(1) of CRF patients correlates with meanNN after HD (indicating a more irregular-like HRV behavior at slower heart rates). This suggests that CRF patients with stable blood pressure preserve a regulatory adaptability despite a shifted setting point of the heart period (i.e., higher heart rate) in comparison with healthy subjects.

N2  - Circadian variation of sinus rate (SR) is well described in subjects with normal  sinus node (SN). On the other hand there are on data in literature concerning the SR daily variations in patients with SN disfunction. In order to clarify this problem we studied the SR circadian variation in normal subjects (12, and in patients with intermittent bradycardia (11), persistent bradycardia (9) and intermittent 2:1 seno-atrial block (7). SR was recorded utilizing ECG Holter monitoring. By histograms obtained every two hours, modal, maximum and minimum SR were evaluated. Time series were analyzed with a computer program for cosinor method. In the patients with normal SN, circadian periodicity in SR was confirmed with acrophase at 1626 (maximum SR), 1638 (minimum SR) and 1631 (SR mode), respectively. In patients with intermittent bradycardia a circadian rhythm was detected only in minimum SR (acrophase 1651) and in SR mode (acrophase: 1631). No statistically significant circadian variations of the 3 parameters of SR were observed in patients with both persistent bradycardia and sinoatrial block. These data suggest that: - the disappearance of circadian periodicity is proportional to the severity of SN dysfunction; - the patients with intermittent bradycardia show a more normal behavior at low rates than at high ones; - the disappearance of circadian rhythm in patients with marked SN disfunction can be related to SN intrinsic involvement and/or autonomic nervous system disfunction.

N2  - Around 5%-10% of newborn babies require some form of resuscitation at birth and  heart rate (HR) is the best guide of efficacy. We report the development and first trial of a device that continuously monitors neonatal HR, with a view to deployment in the delivery room to guide newborn resuscitation. The device uses forehead reflectance photoplethysmography (PPG) with modulated light and lock-in detection. Forehead fixation has numerous advantages including ease of sensor placement, whilst perfusion at the forehead is better maintained in comparison to the extremities. Green light (525 nm) was used, in preference to the more usual red or infrared wavelengths, to optimize the amplitude of the pulsatile signal. Experimental results are presented showing simultaneous PPG and electrocardiogram (ECG) HRs from babies (n = 77), gestational age 26-42 weeks, on a neonatal intensive care unit. In babies ⩾32 weeks gestation, the median reliability was 97.7% at ±10 bpm and the limits of agreement (LOA) between PPG and ECG were +8.39 bpm and -8.39 bpm. In babies <32 weeks gestation, the median reliability was 94.8% at ±10 bpm and the LOA were +11.53 bpm and -12.01 bpm. Clinical evaluation during newborn deliveries is now underway.

N2  - A significant proportion of patients with ventricular fibrillation (VF) can only be  defibrillated after a period of chest compressions and ventilation before the defibrillation attempt. In these patients, unsuccessful defibrillations increase the duration of heart arrest and reduce the possibility of a successful resuscitation, which could be avoided if a reliable prediction for the success of defibrillation could be made. A new method is presented for estimating the irregularity in very short electrocardiographic (ECG) recordings that enables the prediction of a successful defibrillation in patients with VF. This method is based on a recently developed determinism test for very short time series. A slight modification shows that the method can be used to determine relative differences in irregularity of the studied signals. In particular, ECG recordings of VF from patients who could be successfully defibrillated are characterized by a higher level of irregularity, indicating a chaotic nature of the dynamics of the heart, which is in agreement with previous studies on long ECG recordings showing that cardiac chaos was prevalent in healthy heart, whereas in severe congestive heart failure, a decrease in the chaotic behavior was observed.

N2  - The methods of identification and spectral estimate are applied to the tachogram,  i.e. the time series constituted by the cycle-by-cycle R-R interval durations measured on the ECG signal from cardiological patients in ambulatory rehabilitation training after episodes of myocardial infarction or ischemic disease. The Batch Least Squares Method is applied to identify the series as an AR process of 5th order. The whiteness test and Rissanen's optimization criterion are also fulfilled. The clinical information is in this way highly compressed in the pole diagram and in the Maximum Entropy Spectrum (MES) estimated on the basis of the AR coefficients. The experimental results in a restricted set of patients confirm the feasibility of new instrumentation design criteria for non-conventional R-R intervals parametrisation, successive diagnostic classification and beat prediction. Finally, some preliminary considerations about the capabilities of the introduced methods put into evidence the role of computerized techniques in recognizing the fundamental patterns of physiopathological heart rate variability, which the usual conventional methods of ECG analysis are not able to detect in a reliable way.

N2  - How to extract information intensively from ECGs for the diagnosis of cardiovascular  diseases and assessment of heart function is a topical subject. Using a method based on the wavelet transform to calculate the irregularity of the QRS complex, which may relate to inotropy, the QRS complex irregularity time series is successfully extracted from original ECG signals. This provides a new approach to studies of ECG dynamics. With the help of non-linear dynamics theory, the QRS complex irregularity time series of eight subjects from the MIT/BIH arrhythmia database are studied qualitatively and quantitatively, and the characteristics of ECG dynamics are analysed extensively. The power spectrum, phase portrait, correlation dimension, largest Lyapunov exponent, time-dependent divergence exponent and complexity measure all verify the fact that ECG dynamics are dominated by an underlying 5-6-dimensional non-linear chaotic system, whose complexity measure is about 0.7. The QRS complex irregularity time series contains abundant information about all parts of the heart and the regulation of the autonomic nervous system, and so further analyses are of great potential theoretical and clinical significance to patho-physiology studies and ambulatory monitoring.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Noninvasive fetal electrocardiography is emerging as a low-cost and  high-accuracy technology for fetal cardiac monitoring. Signal processing techniques have been used over the past fifty years in this domain. The current major challenges of this domain, addressed in this study are (1) fetal electrocardiogram (fECG) extraction from few numbers of maternal abdominal channels in low signal-to-noise ratios; (2) online fECG extraction; (3) automatic and online signal quality assessment and channel selection; and (4) accurate and robust fetal R-peak detection and ECG parameter extraction. APPROACH: Based on the theory of cyclostationarity, auxiliary maternal ECG channel(s) are synthetically constructed and augmented with the input channels. The augmented data are used to develop a robust multichannel source separation algorithm for online/offline fECG extraction, from as few as a single channel, and an accurate fetal R-peak detector using a two-pass matched filter. Several robust signal quality indexes (SQI) and a voting strategy are also proposed for automatic fetal signal quality assessment. MAIN RESULTS: It is shown that the fECG and the fetal R-peaks can be accurately extracted from standard online available datasets, for which classical source separation methods (requiring many channels) had previously failed. The signal quality indexes fully automate the extraction and channel selection procedure. Finally, the proposed R-peak detector is highly robust to background noise and residual maternal R-peak components. SIGNIFICANCE: The proposed methods for fECG extraction, R-peak detection and automatic channel selection are evaluated (visually and numerically), on two online available datasets and compared with recently developed algorithms. The proposed algorithm is statistically shown to outperform the benchmarks in terms of average and standard deviation.

N2  - This paper describes feature extraction methods using higher order statistics (HOS)  of wavelet packet decomposition (WPD) coefficients for the purpose of automatic heartbeat recognition. The method consists of three stages. First, the wavelet package coefficients (WPC) are calculated for each different type of ECG beat. Then, higher order statistics of WPC are derived. Finally, the obtained feature set is used as input to a classifier, which is based on k-NN algorithm. The MIT-BIH arrhythmia database is used to obtain the ECG records used in this study. All heartbeats in the arrhythmia database are grouped into five main heartbeat classes. The classification accuracy of the proposed system is measured by average sensitivity of 90%, average selectivity of 92% and average specificity of 98%. The results show that HOS of WPC as features are highly discriminative for the classification of different arrhythmic ECG beats.

N2  - We investigated the effects of high-frequency jet ventilation (HFJV) on heart rate  variability in nine patients during fentanyl (10μg·kg(-1)) anesthesia using power spectral density analysis. ECG and arterial pressure were recorded during intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV) (tidal volume 8 ml·kg(-1), respiratory rate 0.25 Hz) and during HFJV [5 Hz, 2.5 kg·(cm(2))(-1)]. The R-R interval time series obtained were analyzed by the autoregressive method, and low-frequency (LF) (0.05-0.15 Hz) power and high-frequency (HF) (0.20-0.50 Hz) power from R-R interval spectra were used for statistical comparison. LF power did not change during IPPV and HFJV (108.8±41.6 ms(2) vs 105.8±22.4 ms(2), mean±SE). HF power was detected during IPPV (65.1±14.3 ms(2)); however, it was not detected during HFJV. Plasma levels of norepinephrine and epinephrine were significantly higher during HFJV than during IPPV. The mean R-R interval, arterial pressure, and arterial blood gas data did not differ between IPPV and HFJV. These data indicate that, during fentanyl anesthesia, HFJV influences mainly the respiratory frequency fluctuation of heart rate variability, and they suggest that alteration of breathing patterns caused by HFJV might be involved, as well as elevated sympathetic neural outflow to the heart.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to survey current practices in European epilepsy  monitoring units (EMUs) with emphasis on safety issues. METHODS: A 37-item questionnaire investigating characteristics and organization of EMUs, including measures for prevention and management of seizure-related serious adverse events (SAEs), was distributed to all identified European EMUs plus one located in Israel (N=150). RESULTS: Forty-eight (32%) EMUs, located in 18 countries, completed the questionnaire. Epilepsy monitoring unit beds are 1-2 in 43%, 3-4 in 34%, and 5-6 in 19% of EMUs; staff physicians are 1-2 in 32%, 3-4 in 34%, and 5-6 in 19% of EMUs. Personnel operating in EMUs include epileptologists (in 69% of EMUs), clinical neurophysiologists trained in epilepsy (in 46% of EMUs), child neurologists (in 35% of EMUs), neurology and clinical neurophysiology residents (in 46% and in 8% of EMUs, respectively), and neurologists not trained in epilepsy (in 27% of EMUs). In 20% of EMUs, patients' observation is only intermittent or during the daytime and primarily carried out by neurophysiology technicians and/or nurses (in 71% of EMUs) or by patients' relatives (in 40% of EMUs). Automatic detection systems for seizures are used in 15%, for body movements in 8%, for oxygen desaturation in 33%, and for ECG abnormalities in 17% of EMUs. Protocols for management of acute seizures are lacking in 27%, of status epilepticus in 21%, and of postictal psychoses in 87% of EMUs. Injury prevention consists of bed protections in 96% of EMUs, whereas antisuffocation pillows are employed in 21%, and environmental protections in monitoring rooms and in bathrooms are implemented in 38% and in 25% of EMUs, respectively. The most common SAEs were status epilepticus reported by 79%, injuries by 73%, and postictal psychoses by 67% of EMUs. CONCLUSIONS: All EMUs have faced different types of SAEs. Wide variation in practice patterns and lack of protocols and of precautions to ensure patients' safety might promote the occurrence and severity of SAEs. Our findings highlight the need for standardized and shared protocols for an effective and safe management of patients in EMUs.

N2  - Large lipid pools in vulnerable plaques, in principle, can be detected using US  based thermal strain imaging (US-TSI). One practical challenge for in vivo cardiovascular application of US-TSI is that the thermal strain is masked by the mechanical strain caused by cardiac pulsation. ECG gating is a widely adopted method for cardiac motion compensation, but it is often susceptible to electrical and physiological noise. In this paper, we present an alternative time series analysis approach to separate thermal strain from the mechanical strain without using ECG. The performance and feasibility of the time-series analysis technique was tested via numerical simulation as well as in vitro water tank experiments using a vessel mimicking phantom and an excised human atherosclerotic artery where the cardiac pulsation is simulated by a pulsatile pump.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Mostly, it is impossible to establish the type of arrhythmias, based  on signs and symptoms only. An ECG device is not always within reach. We presumed the heartscan, a handheld wireless device, to be of value to a GP in emergency situations. We therefore studied inter- and intra-observer variability and the accuracy of the screen readings. METHODS: All consecutive patients visiting the emergency department (ED) of the Gasthuisberg University Hospital in Leuven, Belgium, as well as patients hospitalised in three hospital wards on one day, were included. Immediately after the heartscan recording, a standard 12-lead ECG was recorded and read by an experienced hospital-based cardiologist. The recordings were read on the device screen by two general practitioners. All readers were blinded to the 12-lead ECG readings and vice versa, and for each other's ones. We compared both the heartscan reading of the first reader and the automatic reading of the device with the readings of the second GP and to the 12-lead ECG results, used as the gold standard. Intra- and inter-observer agreement was studied using total accuracy and kappa values with their 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: Full data of 177 (73%) patients, 80 men (45%) and 97 women (55%), with a mean age of 55 years (range 18-94 y) were recorded. The specificity of the heartscan reading by a clinician was 88%, the sensitivity between 60 and 69%, PPV < 50% and NPV > 95%. Comparing codes of the heartscan with the ECG readings was difficult but sensitivity for atrial fibrillation was 92.3%. Inter- and intra-observer accuracy were high (> 0.86 and > or = 0.95, respectively), with low kappa values. CONCLUSION: The detection of rhythm disorders by the device is incomplete. However, the heartscan can be a help for the GP. The performance of the heartscan could probably be improved by increasing screen resolution, but, in the future, more sophisticated heart monitors should become available. They should be small, light and affordable.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The postprocedural trajectory of patients undergoing transcatheter  aortic valve replacement (TAVR) involves in-hospital monitoring of potential cardiac rhythm or conduction disorders and other complications. Recent advances in telemonitoring technologies create opportunities to monitor electrocardiogram (ECG) and vital signs remotely, facilitating redesign of follow-up trajectories. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to outline a potential set-up of telemonitoring after TAVR. METHODS: A multidisciplinary team systematically framed the envisioned telemonitoring scenario according to the intentions, People, Activities, Context, Technology (iPACT) and Functionality, Interaction, Content, Services (FICS) methods and identified corresponding technical requirements. RESULTS: In this scenario, a wearable sensor system is used to continuously transmit ECG and contextual data to a central monitoring unit, allowing remote follow-up of ECG abnormalities and physical deteriorations. Telemonitoring is suggested as an alternative or supplement to current in-hospital monitoring after TAVR, enabling early hospital dismissal in eligible patients and accessible follow-up prolongation. Together, this approach aims to improve rehabilitation, enhance patient comfort, optimize hospital capacity usage, and reduce overall costs. Required technical components include continuous data acquisition, real-time data transfer, privacy-ensured storage, automatic event detection, and user-friendly interfaces. CONCLUSIONS: The suggested telemonitoring set-up involves a new approach to patient follow-up that could bring durable solutions for the growing scarcities in health care and for improving health care quality. To further explore the potential and feasibility of post-TAVR telemonitoring, we recommend evaluation of the overall impact on patient outcomes and of the safety, social, ethical, legal, organizational, and financial factors.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Multiple methods have been developed to assess what happens between and  within time series. In a particular type of these series, the previous values of the currently observed series are contingent on the lagged values of another series. These cases can commonly be addressed by regression. However, a model selection criteria should be employed to evaluate the compromise between the amount of information provided and the model complexity. This is the basis for the development of the Matrix of Lags (MoL), a tool to study dependent time series. METHODS: For each input, multiple regressions were applied to produce a model for each lag and a model selection criterion identifies the lags that will populate an auxiliary matrix. Afterwards, the energy of the lags (that are in the auxiliary matrix) was used to define a row of the MoL. Therefore, each input corresponds to a row of the MoL. To test the proposed tool, the heart rate variability and the electrocardiogram derived respiration were employed to perform the indirect estimation of the electroencephalography cyclic alternating pattern (CAP) cycles. Therefore, a support vector machine was fed with the MoL to perform the CAP cycle classification for each input signal. Multiple tests were carried out to further examine the proposed tool, including the effect of balancing the datasets, application of other regression methods and employment of two feature section models. The first was based on sequential backward selection while the second examined characteristics of a return map. RESULTS: The best performance of the subject independent model was attained by feeding the lags, selected by sequential backward selection, to a support vector machine, achieving an average accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of, respectively, 77%, 71%, 82% and 0.77. CONCLUSIONS: The developed model allows to perform a measurement of a characteristic marker of sleep instability (the CAP cycle) and the results are in the upper bound of the specialist agreement range with visual analysis. Thus, the developed method could possibly be used for clinical diagnosis.

N2  - Automatic classification of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals is important for  diagnosing heart arrhythmias. A big challenge in automatic ECG classification is the variation in the waveforms and characteristics of ECG signals among different patients. To address this issue, this paper proposes adapting a patient-independent deep neural network (DNN) using the information in the patient-dependent identity vectors (i-vectors). The adapted networks, namely i-vector adapted patient-specific DNNs (iAP-DNNs), are tuned toward the ECG characteristics of individual patients. For each patient, his/her ECG waveforms are compressed into an i-vector using a factor analysis model. Then, this i-vector is injected into the middle hidden layer of the patient-independent DNN. Stochastic gradient descent is then applied to fine-tune the whole network to form a patient-specific classifier. As a result, the adaptation makes use of not only the raw ECG waveforms from the specific patient but also the compact representation of his/her ECG characteristics through the i-vector. Analysis on the hidden-layer activations shows that by leveraging the information in the i-vectors, the iAP-DNNs are more capable of discriminating normal heartbeats against arrhythmic heartbeats than the networks that use the patient-specific ECG only for the adaptation. Experimental results based on the MIT-BIH database suggest that the iAP-DNNs perform better than existing patient-specific classifiers in terms of various performance measures. In particular, the sensitivity and specificity of the existing methods are all under the receiver operating characteristic curves of the iAP-DNNs.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Realistic modeling of cardiac inter-beat (RR) intervals is highly  desirable for basic research in cardiac electrophysiology, clinical management of heart diseases, and developing signal processing tools for ECG analysis. METHODS: We present an open source computer model that is capable to generate realistic time series of RR intervals in both physiologic and pathologic conditions. Detailed model structure and the software implementation are described. RESULTS: Examples are provided on how to use this model to generate RR intervals in atrial fibrillation with ventricular pacing, normal sinus rhythm with heart rate variability, and typical atrial flutter with atrioventricular block. The extensibility of the model is also discussed. CONCLUSION: The present computer model provides a unified platform wherein various types of ventricular rhythm can be simulated. The availability of this open source model promises to support and stimulate future studies.

N2  - Sepsis is a systemic deleterious host response to infection. It is a major  healthcare problem that affects millions of patients every year in the intensive care units (ICUs) worldwide. Despite the fact that ICU patients are heavily instrumented with physiological sensors, early sepsis detection remains challenging, perhaps because clinicians identify sepsis by using static scores derived from bed-side measurements individually, i.e., without systematically accounting for potential interactions between these signals and their dynamics. In this study, we apply network-based data analysis to take into account interactions between bed-side physiological time series (PTS) data collected in ICU patients, and we investigate features to distinguish between sepsis and non-sepsis conditions. We treated each PTS source as a node on a graph and we retrieved the graph connectivity matrix over time by tracking the correlation between each pair of sources' signals over consecutive time windows. Then, for each connectivity matrix, we computed the eigenvalue decomposition. We found that, even though raw PTS measurements may have indistinguishable distributions in non-sepsis and early sepsis states, the median /I of the eigenvalues computed from the same data is statistically different (p <; 0.001) in the two states and the evolution of /I may reflect the disease progression. Although preliminary, these findings suggest that network-based features computed from continuous PTS data may be useful for early sepsis detection.

N2  - Until recently, cardiovascular computed tomography angiography (CCTA) was associated  with considerable radiation doses. The introduction of tube current modulation and automatic tube potential selection as well as high-pitch prospective ECG-triggering and iterative reconstruction offer the ability to decrease dose with approximately one order of magnitude, often to sub-millisievert dose levels. In parallel, advancements in computational technology have enabled the measurement of fractional flow reserve (FFR) from CCTA data (FFRCT). This technique shows potential to replace invasively measured FFR to select patients in need of coronary intervention. Furthermore, developments in scanner hardware have led to the introduction of dual-energy and photon-counting CT, which offer the possibility of material decomposition imaging. Dual-energy CT reduces beam hardening, which enables CCTA in patients with a high calcium burden and more robust myocardial CT perfusion imaging. Future-generation CT systems will be capable of counting individual X-ray photons. Photon-counting CT is promising and may result in a substantial further radiation dose reduction, vastly increased spatial resolution, and the introduction of a whole new class of contrast agents.

N2  - The coupling of respiratory and cardiac rhythm is determined by interactions of  oscillating brain stem centers and external physical and psychical influences. Not well known are effects of sleep and wakefulness which will be investigated over the day. From the ECG and respirogram of 42 healthy children (11 female, 31 male, 12 to 14 years) during 24 h the time series of instantaneous heart rate (HR) and respiratory rhythm and from this by FFT the density spectra of power, the maximal power and related frequency in the respiratory range were ascertained. Differences between nonREM sleep and wakefulness and the strength of coupling were determined by coherence analysis. In all probands the maximal power of HR and of the coherence were higher during nonREM sleep than in wakefulness. Both values were stable during each state. The maximum related frequencies of HR and respiration shifted parallel between sleep and wakefulness. The results mean augmentation in nonREM sleep following to improved transfer of respiratory activity to the control of HR. The increased coherence hints at a stronger linear coupling which is stable during each state. The changes of cardiorespiratory coupling may be effected by stronger non-linear parts in the interactions during wakefulness.

N2  - BACKGROUND: T-wave alternans (TWA) is defined as a consistent variation in the  repolarization morphology that repeats on every other beat. This study aimed to evaluate beat-to-beat TWA detection using the Ensemble EMD (EEMD) method. METHOD: A total of 108 recordings of standard 12-lead ECGs of 69 healthy subjects (17 females, 42±18 years; 52 males, 40±13 years) and 39 cardiac-condition patients (ischemic cardiomyopathy; ICM and dilated cardiomyopathy; DCM) with left ventricular ejection fractions (LVEF) ≤40% were studied. We first determined the QT interval of ECG via a template matching algorithm. Then, beat-to-beat T-waves were extracted to quantify beat-to-beat TWA. The EEMD method was applied to the T-wave time series to decompose them into a set of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). The instantaneous frequency was measured by performing the Hilbert transform on the selected IMF for extracting the features. Four different classifiers were applied to the extracted features to assess and classify the existence of TWA in the ECG signal. RESULTS: In the simulation study, the global classifier worked better than the subject-based classifier for detecting alternans in the T-waves. In addition, the average accuracy and sensitivity for detecting TWA were greater than 80%. In the real Holter ECG data obtained from Toronto General Hospital, the Ensemble classifier had higher classification accuracy, 74%, than other classifiers and a positive predictive value of 100%. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the proposed Ensemble EMD method with Ensemble classifier can be utilized for detecting beat-to-beat TWA in the ECG signal.

N2  - In order to compare the heart rate variability (HRV) and stroke volume variability  (SVV), supine electrocardiographic (ECG) and the time series data of left ventricular (LV) volume recordings were taken in 12 healthy adult male volunteers. The low frequency (LF) and high frequency (HF) peaks of HRV and SVV were evaluated quantitatively by power spectral analysis. The fractal dimension (FD) of the time series data was analyzed by the box-counting method. A LF peak around 0.1 Hz and a HF peak around 0.3 Hz were as clearly observed in the SVV spectrum as in the HRV spectrum. The LF/HF ratio in SVV was significantly lower than that in HRV, while the FD was significantly higher in SVV than in HRV. No significant correlation of HF, LF or FD was observed between HRV and SVV. Our results indicate that SVV provides different information about the activity of the autonomic nervous system than HRV.

N2  - The assessment of signal quality has been a research topic since the late 1970s, as  it is mainly related to the problem of false alarms in bedside monitors in the intensive care unit (ICU), the incidence of which can be as high as 90 %, leading to alarm fatigue and a drop in the overall level of nurses and clinicians attention. The development of efficient algorithms for the quality control of long diagnostic electrocardiographic (ECG) recordings, both single- and multi-lead, and of the arterial blood pressure (ABP) signal is therefore essential for the enhancement of care quality. The ECG signal is often corrupted by noise, which can be within the frequency band of interest and can manifest similar morphologies as the ECG itself. Similarly to ECG, also the ABP signal is often corrupted by non-Gaussian, nonlinear and non-stationary noise and artifacts, especially in ICU recordings. Moreover, the reliability of several important parameters derived from ABP such as systolic blood pressure or pulse pressure is strongly affected by the quality of the ABP waveform. In this work, several up-to-date algorithms for the quality scoring of a single- or multi-lead ECG recording, based on time-domain approaches, frequency-domain approaches or a combination of the two will be reviewed, as well as methods for the quality assessment of ABP. Additionally, algorithms exploiting the relationship between ECG and pulsatile signals, such as ABP and photoplethysmographic recordings, for the reduction in the false alarm rate will be presented. Finally, some considerations will be drawn taking into account the large heterogeneity of clinical settings, applications and goals that the reviewed algorithms have to deal with.

N2  - Automatic heartbeat classification is an important technique to assist doctors to  identify ectopic heartbeats in long-term Holter recording. In this paper, we introduce a novel disease-specific feature selection method which consists of a one-versus-one (OvO) features ranking stage and a feature search stage wrapped in the same OvO-rule support vector machine (SVM) binary classifier. The proposed method differs from traditional approaches in that it focuses on the selection of effective feature subsets for distinguishing a class from others by making OvO comparison. The electrocardiograms (ECG) from the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database (MIT-BIH-AR) are used to evaluate the proposed feature selection method. The ECG features adopted include inter-beat and intra-beat intervals, amplitude morphology, area morphology and morphological distance. Following the recommendation of the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI), all the heartbeat samples of MIT-BIH-AR are grouped into four classes, namely, normal or bundle branch block (N), supraventricular ectopic (S), ventricular ectopic (V) and fusion of ventricular and normal (F). The division of training and testing data complies with the inter-patient schema. Experimental results show that the average classification accuracy of the proposed feature selection method is 86.66%, outperforming those methods without feature selection. The sensitivities for the classes N, S, V and F are 88.94%, 79.06%, 85.48% and 93.81% respectively, and the corresponding positive predictive values are 98.98%, 35.98%, 92.75% and 13.74% respectively. In terms of geometric means of sensitivity and positive predictivity, the proposed method also demonstrates better performance than other state-of-the-art feature selection methods.

N2  - PURPOSE: To assess the clinical significance of serial troponin I levels (measured  in the first 72 hours from admission) in 42 consecutive patients with moderate-to-severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Echocardiography and electrocardiogram testings were serially performed in the time window. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Troponin I was measured every 12 hours in the first 72 hours from intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Echocardiography and electrocardiogram testings were serially performed in the same time window to clinically interpret Tn I levels. RESULTS: Patients with admission positive Tn I (38.1%) showed higher values of systolic pulmonary hypertension (P = .013) associated with significantly lower values of tricuspid annular plane excursion (P = .011). Twenty-five patients (25/42, 59.5%) exhibited positive peak Tn I and at second echocardiographic assessment exhibited significant lower tricuspid annular plane excursion values (P = .005). At stepwise regression analysis the following variables were an independent predictor for in-ICU mortality: Pco2 (OR 1.08, 95% CI 1.011-1.161, P = .023), systolic pulmonary arterial hypertension (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.701-0.977, P = .002), log peak Tn I (OR 3.56, 95% CI 1.045-12.132, P = .042). CONCLUSIONS: In moderate-to-severe ARDS, serial troponin I assessment together with echocardiography evaluation helped to identify a subgroup at higher risk for in-ICU death. Moreover, troponin release can be related to right ventricular dysfunction, thus highlighting the clinical role of echocardiography in ARDS patients.

N2  - We encountered a 2-year-old female infant with congenital central hypoventilation  syndrome (CCHS) who underwent an abdominal operation for strangulated ileus. Prior to the surgery, at home, the infant had been receiving non-invasive positive-pressure ventilation (NPPV) support only during sleep. However, after postoperative extubation, the blood oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) decreased to approximately 90 % with NPPV during sleep alone, necessitating the use of biphasic cuirass ventilation (BCV) along with NPPV for 2 days. The infant was weaned from the BCV on hospital day 9, and was discharged from the intensive care unit (ICU) on hospital day 13. Although it has been said that CCHS is not under the control of the respiratory center, there are no reports of the true CO(2) response curves in these patients. Therefore, during respiratory management in the ICU post-surgery, we examined (with the consent of the mother) the relationship of the end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO(2)) to the tidal volume and respiratory rate, for a period of 6 min in the absence of sedation, using a respiratory profile monitor. Electrocardiographic and SpO(2) monitoring was also conducted at the same time, to ensure the patient's safety. In this patient, while the ETCO(2) increased, the tidal volume and respiratory rate remained unchanged. No relationship was found between the tidal volume and the respiratory rate. Various modalities have been used for the treatment of CCHS (tracheotomy, NPPV, and diaphragmatic pacing). Treatment of these patients in the ICU should be tailored to the needs of individual patients and their families.

N2  - Early detection of coronary heart disease (CHD) has the potential to prevent the  millions of deaths that this disease causes worldwide every year. However, there exist few automatic methods to detect CHD at an early stage. A challenge in the development of these methods is the absence of relevant datasets for their training and validation. Here, the ten Tusscher-Panfilov 2006 model and the O'Hara-Rudy model for human myocytes were used to create two populations of models that were in concordance with data obtained from healthy individuals (control populations) and included inter-subject variability. The effects of ischemia were subsequently included in the control populations to simulate the effects of mild and severe ischemic events on single cells, full ischemic cables of cells and cables of cells with various sizes of ischemic regions. Action potential and pseudo-ECG biomarkers were measured to assess how the evolution of ischemia could be quantified. Finally, two neural network classifiers were trained to identify the different degrees of ischemia using the pseudo-ECG biomarkers. The control populations showed action potential and pseudo-ECG biomarkers within the physiological ranges and the trends in the biomarkers commonly identified in ischemic patients were observed in the ischemic populations. On the one hand, inter-subject variability in the ischemic pseudo-ECGs precluded the detection and classification of early ischemic events using any single biomarker. On the other hand, the neural networks showed sensitivity and positive predictive value above 95%. Additionally, the neural networks revealed that the biomarkers that were relevant for the detection of ischemia were different from those relevant for its classification. This work showed that a computational approach could be used, when data is scarce, to validate proof-of-concept machine learning methods to detect ischemic events.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of the time interval from indication of hypoxia to  delivery on neonatal outcome in high-risk pregnancies monitored with cardiotocography (CTG) and ST-waveform analysis. DESIGN: Prospective observational study. SETTING: University hospital, Norway, 2004-08. POPULATION: Singleton high-risk births with a gestational age above 35(+6) weeks, monitored with CTG and ST-waveform analysis. METHODS: Logistic regression analysis and Kaplan-Meier survival plots. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Neonatal morbidity in relation to the rapidity of intervention. RESULTS: Of 6010 deliveries monitored with ST-waveform analysis, 1131 (19%) had an indication to intervene for fetal distress according to clinical guidelines. Those fetuses were at increased risk of an adverse neonatal outcome, and if delivered later than 20 min after the indication of hypoxia their risk increased further; i.e. transfer to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) from an odds ratio of 1.6 (95% confidence interval 1.2-2.2) to an odds ratio of 3.3 (95% confidence interval 2.5-4.3). The indication-to-delivery interval was longer for neonates with a 5-min Apgar score of <7, transfer to NICU and neonatal encephalopathy than for those without adverse outcome. CONCLUSION: In deliveries monitored with CTG and ST-waveform analysis, the risk of an adverse neonatal outcome was dependent on the time between indication of hypoxia and delivery. Nonadherence to the specific clinical guidelines increased the risk of neonatal morbidity.

N2  - Automatic classification of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals is vital for clinical  diagnosis of heart disease. This paper investigates the design of an efficient system for recognition of the premature ventricular contraction from the normal beats and other heart diseases. This system includes three main modules: denoising module, feature extraction module and classifier module. In the denoising module, it is proposed the stationary wavelet transform for noise reduction of the electrocardiogram signals. In the feature extraction module a proper combination of the morphological-based features and timing interval-based features are proposed. As the classifier, several supervised classifiers are investigated; they are: a number of multi-layer perceptron neural networks with different number of layers and training algorithms, support vector machines with different kernel types, radial basis function and probabilistic neural networks. Also, for comparison the proposed features, we have considered the wavelet-based features. It has done comprehensive simulations in order to achieve a high efficient system for ECG beat classification from 12 files obtained from the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database. Simulation results show that best results are achieved about 97.14% for classification of ECG beats.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To study the association of T-wave amplitude on electrocardiogram (ECG)  with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in children with dilated cardiomyopathy. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed for the clinical data of 44 children who were diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy from May 2009 to June 2018. According to LVEF, they were divided into two groups: LVEF ≥50% group (n=26) and LVEF <50% group (n=18). After treatment, 25 children were followed up for 3-42 months (mean 14±9 months). The Guangdong Zhongshan SR-1000A ECG Automatic Analyzer was used to obtain the 12-lead body surface ECG results in the supine position. T-wave amplitude on ECG was evaluated by software and manual measurement. RESULTS: Compared with the LVEF ≥50% group, the LVEF <50% group had a significant reduction in the T-wave amplitude in leads II, V4, V5 and V6 (P<0.05). The increased-LVEF group (an increase in LVEF > 5% after treatment) had a significant increase in the T-wave amplitude in leads aVR, V5, and V6 after treatment (P<0.05), while the unchanged-LVEF group (an increase in LVEF ≤ 5% after treatment) had a significant reduction in the T-wave amplitude in lead aVR after treatment (P<0.05). The receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that the T-wave amplitude in leads II, V4, V5 and V6 had a certain value in predicting LVEF <50% in children with dilated cardiomyopathy (P<0.05). A combination of T-wave amplitude of ≤0.20 mV in lead II, ≤0.40 mV in lead V4, and ≤0.30 mV in leads V5 and V6 had a sensitivity of 88.2% and specificity of 76.0% in the predication of LVEF <50% in children with dilated cardiomyopathy. CONCLUSIONS: T-wave amplitude on ECG can be used as the indexes for the evaluation of the left ventricular systolic function in children with dilated cardiomyopathy.

N2  - AIMS: Continuous rhythm monitoring is valuable for adequate atrial fibrillation (AF)  management in the clinical setting. Subcutaneous leadless implantable cardiac monitors (ICMs) yield an improved AF detection, overcoming the intrinsic limitations of the currently available external recording systems, thus resulting in a more accurate patient treatment. The study purpose was to assess the detection performance of a novel three-vector ICM device equipped with a dedicated AF algorithm. METHODS AND RESULTS: Sixty-six patients (86.4% males; mean age 60.4 ± 9.4 years) at risk to present AF episodes, having undergone the novel ICM implant (BioMonitor, Biotronik SE&Co. KG, Berlin, Germany), were enrolled. External 48-h ECG Holter was performed 4 weeks after the device implantation. The automatic ICM AF classification was compared with the manual Holter arrhythmia recordings. Of the overall study population, 63/66 (95.5%) had analysable Holter data, 39/63 (62%) showed at least one true AF episode. All these patients had at least one AF episode stored in the ICM. On Holter monitoring, 24/63 (38%) patients did not show AF episodes, in 16 of them (16/24, 67%), the ICM confirmed the absence of AF. The AF detection sensitivity and positive predictive value for episodes' analysis were 95.4 and 76.3%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Continuous monitoring using this novel device, equipped with a dedicated detection algorithm, yields an accurate and reliable detection of AF episodes. The ICM is a promising tool for tailoring individual AF patient management. Further long-term prospective studies are necessary to confirm these encouraging results.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Although modern defibrillators are nearly always successful in  terminating ventricular fibrillation (VF), multiple defibrillation attempts are usually required to achieve return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). This is potentially deleterious as cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) must be discontinued during each defibrillation attempt which causes deterioration in the heart muscle and reduces the chance of ROSC from later defibrillation attempts. In this work defibrillation outcomes are predicted prior to electrical shocks using a neural network model to analyse VF time series in an attempt to avoid defibrillation attempts that do not result in ROSC. METHODS: The 198 pre-shock VF ECG episodes from 83 cardiac arrest patients with defibrillation conversions to different outcomes were selected from the Oslo ambulance service database. A probabilistic neural network model was designed for training and testing with a cross validation method being used for the better generalisation performance. RESULTS: We achieved an accuracy of 75% in overall prediction with a sensitivity of 84% and a specificity of 65% using VF ECG time series of an order of 1 s in length. CONCLUSION: Pre-shock VF ECG time series can be classified according to the defibrillation conversion to a return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) or No-ROSC.

N2  - Correct detection and classification of ventricular fibrillation (VF) and rapid  ventricular tachycardia (VT) is of pivotal importance for an automatic external defibrillator and patient monitoring. In this paper, a VF/VT classification algorithm using a machine learning method, a support vector machine, is proposed. A total of 14 metrics were extracted from a specific window length of the electrocardiogram (ECG). A genetic algorithm was then used to select the optimal variable combinations. Three annotated public domain ECG databases (the American Heart Association Database, the Creighton University Ventricular Tachyarrhythmia Database, and the MIT-BIH Malignant Ventricular Arrhythmia Database) were used as training, test, and validation datasets. Different window sizes, varying from 1 to 10 s were tested. An accuracy (Ac) of 98.1%, sensitivity (Se) of 98.4%, and specificity (Sp) of 98.0% were obtained on the in-sample training data with 5 s-window size and two selected metrics. On the out-of-sample validation data, an Ac of 96.3% ± 3.4%, Se of 96.2% ± 2.7%, and Sp of 96.2% ± 4.6% were obtained by fivefold cross validation. The results surpass those of current reported methods.

N2  - Sleep/wake classification systems that rely on physiological signals suffer from  intersubject differences that make accurate classification with a single, subject-independent model difficult. To overcome the limitations of intersubject variability, we suggest a novel online adaptation technique that updates the sleep/wake classifier in real time. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the performance of a newly developed adaptive classification algorithm that was embedded on a wearable sleep/wake classification system called SleePic. The algorithm processed ECG and respiratory effort signals for the classification task and applied behavioral measurements (obtained from accelerometer and press-button data) for the automatic adaptation task. When trained as a subject-independent classifier algorithm, the SleePic device was only able to correctly classify 74.94 ± 6.76% of the human-rated sleep/wake data. By using the suggested automatic adaptation method, the mean classification accuracy could be significantly improved to 92.98 ± 3.19%. A subject-independent classifier based on activity data only showed a comparable accuracy of 90.44 ± 3.57%. We demonstrated that subject-independent models used for online sleep-wake classification can successfully be adapted to previously unseen subjects without the intervention of human experts or off-line calibration.

N2  - In this study, the effects of long-term physical training on autonomic function in  athletes and the response of the autonomic nervous system to dynamic exercise were investigated in nonathletes and athletes with power spectral analysis of heart rate variability (HRV). This study was performed on 13 healthy subjects (5 athletes and 8 non athletes). Electrocardiographic (ECG) signals were continuously recorded during (1) 15 min of rest in a sitting position on a bicycle ergometer, (2) the dynamic exercise test to the point of exhaustion, and (3) a 15 min postexercise period. After the recorded ECG signals were sampled at 500 samples/s, the instantaneous HRV signal was constructed from the detected R peaks and then resampled at 4 Hz in order to obtain an evenly spaced time series applicable to power spectral analysis. After linear trends were removed by the robust locally weighted regression algorithm, the power spectrum of HRV was estimated for contiguous records of 512 samples by Burg's maximum entrophy method. HRV was quantified by determining the spectral area (power) in two frequency bands, low-frequency power (LF power: 0.05-0.15 Hz) and high-frequency power (HF power: 0.15-0.8 Hz), and their ratio. The comparison between athletes and nonathlete was performed in terms of the above-mentioned parameters. Although both groups showed similar trends in heart rate (HR) at all stages of protocols, HR in athletes was significantly lower than that in nonathletes during rest and postexercise. In athletes and nonathletes, LF and HF powers gradually decreased with exercise. As recovery progressed, they continued to increase gradually, but remained below resting level. During rest and postexercise, HF power in athletes was significantly (p < 0.05) higher than than in nonathletes. Also, the recovery of HR and HF powers during early recovery (PO1) was more rapid in athletes than in nonathletes. Both groups showed an attenuation of LF and HF powers during dynamic exercise. It is likely that, in athletes, the lower HR during rest and the more rapid recovery of HR postexercise was due to a high level of HF power, indicating that vagal activity was enhanced by the adaptive changes in neural regulation produced by long-term physical training.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: The description and evaluation of algorithms using Independent Component  Analysis (ICA) for automatic removal of ECG, pulsation and respiration artifacts in neonatal EEG before automated seizure detection. METHODS: The developed algorithms decompose the EEG using ICA into its underlying sources. The artifact source was identified using the simultaneously recorded polygraphy signals after preprocessing. The EEG was reconstructed without the corrupting source, leading to a clean EEG. The impact of the artifact removal was measured by comparing the performance of a previously developed seizure detector before and after the artifact removal in 13 selected patients (9 having artifact-contaminated and 4 having artifact-free EEGs). RESULTS: A significant decrease in false alarms (p=0.01) was found while the Good Detection Rate (GDR) for seizures was not altered (p=0.50). CONCLUSIONS: The techniques reduced the number of false positive detections without lowering sensitivity and are beneficial in long term EEG seizure monitoring in the presence of disturbing biological artifacts. SIGNIFICANCE: The proposed algorithms improve neonatal seizure monitoring.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Rett Syndrome (RTT), caused by a loss-of-function in the epigenetic  modulator: X-linked methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2), is a pervasive neurological disorder characterized by compromised brain functions, anxiety, severe mental retardation, language and learning disabilities, repetitive stereotyped hand movements and developmental regression. An imbalance in the sympathetic and the parasympathetic nervous system (dysautonomia) and the resulting autonomic storms is a frequent occurrence in patients with RTT. The prototypical beta blocker propranolol has been used to manage sympathetic hyperactivity in patients with RTT. CASE PRESENTATION: A 13 year old girl with RTT was referred to the Centre for Interventional Paediatric Psychopharmacology and Rare Diseases (CIPPRD), South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust. Her clinical picture included disordered breathing with concomitant hyperventilation and apnoea, epilepsy, scoliosis, no QT prolongation (QT/QTc [372/467 ms on automated electrocardiogram [ECG], but manually calculated to be 440 ms]), no cardiac abnormalities (PR interval: 104 ms, QRS duration: 78 ms), and generalised anxiety disorder (ICD-10-CM Diagnosis Code F41.1). She was also constipated and was fed via percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). To manage the dysautonomia, propranolol was given (5 mg and 10 mg) and in parallel her physiological parameters, including heart rate, skin temperature and skin transpiration, were monitored continuously for 24 h as she went about her activities of daily living. Whilst her skin temperature increased and skin transpiration decreased, unexpectedly there was a significant paradoxical increase in the patient's average heart rate following propranolol treatment. CONCLUSION: Here, we present a unique case of a paradoxical increase in heart rate response following propranolol treatment for managing dysautonomia in a child with RTT. Further studies are warranted to better understand the underlying dysautonomia in patients with RTT and the impact this might have on treatment strategies in rare disorders such as RTT.

N2  - An algorithm to determine the quality of electrocardiograms (ECGs) can enable  inexperienced nurses and paramedics to record ECGs of sufficient diagnostic quality. Previously, we proposed an algorithm for determining if ECG recordings are of acceptable quality, which was entered in the PhysioNet Challenge 2011. In the present work, we propose an improved two-step algorithm, which first rejects ECGs with macroscopic errors (signal absent, large voltage shifts or saturation) and subsequently quantifies the noise (baseline, powerline or muscular noise) on a continuous scale. The performance of the improved algorithm was evaluated using the PhysioNet Challenge database (1500 ECGs rated by humans for signal quality). We achieved a classification accuracy of 92.3% on the training set and 90.0% on the test set. The improved algorithm is capable of detecting ECGs with macroscopic errors and giving the user a score of the overall quality. This allows the user to assess the degree of noise and decide if it is acceptable depending on the purpose of the recording.

N2  - The current state-of-the-art in automatic QRS detection methods show high robustness  and almost negligible error rates. In return, the methods are usually based on machine-learning approaches that require sufficient computational resources. However, simple-fast methods can also achieve high detection rates. There is a need to develop numerically efficient algorithms to accommodate the new trend towards battery-driven ECG devices and to analyze long-term recorded signals in a time-efficient manner. A typical QRS detection method has been reduced to a basic approach consisting of two moving averages that are calibrated by a knowledge base using only two parameters. In contrast to high-accuracy methods, the proposed method can be easily implemented in a digital filter design.

N2  - BACKGROUND: One of the biggest obstacles to reliable pulse rate variability (PRV)  analysis is the erroneous detection of photoplethysmographic (PPG) pulses. Among all the disturbances that may hinder pulse detection, the ripples appearing at the smooth segments of the PPG signal can become a serious problem when the amplitude of the signal decreases considerably. OBJECTIVE: To present a low-complexity PPG pulse detection method for reliable PRV estimation under conditions in which a sudden decrease in the amplitude of the PPG signal can be expected. APPROACH: 2-min ECG and PPG data (sampling rate at 500 Hz) were obtained from thirty healthy subjects, who were asked to take a deep inspiration to provoke a sudden amplitude decrease (SAD) of the PPG signal. After introducing a new parameter denoted as C, through which it is possible to jump over the ripples hindering the accurate detection of the systolic peaks, 500 Hz-sampled PPG recordings were down-sampled (400, 300, 200 and 100 Hz) to investigate the effect of the sampling rate on pulse detection. For ECG recordings, automatic R-peak detection was performed by the Pan and Tompkins (PT) algorithm, whereas PPG pulse detection was performed by the well-known maximum of the first derivative (M1D) and the proposed method, once the C-value for best detection results on 500 Hz-sampled PPG recordings was found. The agreement between heart rate variability (HRV) and PRVs estimated from each pulse detection method was assessed and the correlation between HRV and PRV-derived indexes was computed for comparison. MAIN RESULTS: The proposed method can perform well on PPG-SAD segments, provided that the proper value of the parameter C is used. Moreover, a good agreement between HRV and PRV series, as well as lower relative errors and higher correlation coefficients between HRV and PRV indexes, were achieved by the proposed pulse detection method during SADs. SIGNIFICANCE: Results show that the proposed method can dynamically adapt to circumstances in which a decrease in the amplitude of the PPG signal can be expected, providing continuous systolic peak detection and reliable PRV estimation under those conditions. However, more extensive testing under a wide range of conditions is needed to perform a more rigorous validation.

N2  - Electroencephalography (EEG) is an important clinical tool for monitoring  neurological health. However, the required equipment, expertise, and patient preparation inhibits its use outside of tertiary care. Non-experts struggle to obtain high-quality EEG due to its low amplitude and artefact susceptibility. Wet electrodes are currently used, which require abrasive/conductive gels to reduce skin-electrode impedance. Advances in dry electrodes, which do not require gels, have simplified this process. However, the assessment of dry electrodes on neonates is limited due to health and safety barriers. This study presents a simulation framework for assessing the quality of EEG systems using a neonatal EEG database, without the use of human participants. The framework is used to evaluate a low-cost EEG acquisition system and compare performance of wet and dry (Micro Transdermal Interface Platforms (MicroTIPs), g.tec-g.SAHARA) electrodes using accurately acquired impedance models. A separate experiment assessing the electrodes on adult participants was conducted to verify the simulation framework's efficacy. Dry electrodes have higher impedance than wet electrodes, causing a reduction in signal quality. However, MicroTIPs perform comparably to wet electrodes at the frontal region and g.tec-g.SAHARA performs well at the occipital region. Using the simulation framework, a 25dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) was obtained for the low-cost EEG system. The tests on adults closely matched the simulated results.

N2  - Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) must be interrupted for reliable rhythm analysis  in current automatic external defibrillators because of artifacts produced by chest compressions. However, interruptions in CPR adversely affect the restoration of spontaneous circulation and survival. Suppressing CPR artifacts by digital signal processing techniques is a promising method to enable rhythm analysis during chest compressions, which would eliminate CPR interruptions for rhythm analysis. Although numerous methods have been developed to suppress CPR artifacts, the accuracy of rhythm analysis is still inadequate due to the residual artifact components in the filtered signal. This study proposes an enhanced adaptive filtering method to suppress CPR artifacts. A total of 183 shockable and 453 nonshockable segments of ECG signal, together with CPR-related reference signal, were extracted from 233 out of hospital cardiac arrest patients. The method was optimized on a training set with 85 shockable and 211 nonshockable segments, and evaluated on a testing set with 98 shockable and 242 nonshockable segments. Compared with artifact corrupted ECG signals, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) increased from -9.8 ± 12.5 to 11.2 ± 11.8 dB, and the accuracy was improved from 74.1% to 92.0% after filtering with the proposed method. Compared with the traditional adaptive filter, the SNR was improved by 1.7 dB and the accuracy was improved by 5.6 points. These results indicated that the proposed method could effectively suppress the chest compression related artifacts and improve the accuracy of rhythm analysis during uninterrupted CPR.

N2  - Heart rate variability (HRV) has been recognised as a non-invasive method for  assessing cardiac autonomic regulation. Aiming to characterize HRV changes at labour in women, we studied 10 minute ECG recordings from young mothers (n=30) at the third trimester of pregnancy (P) or during augmentation of labour (L) (n=30). Data of the L group were collected when no-contractions (L-NC) or the contractile activity (L-C) was manifested. Accordingly, the inter-beat interval (IBI) time series were processed to estimate relevant parameters of HRV such as the mean IBI (IBI¯), the mean heart rate HR¯, the root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD) in IBIs, the natural logarithm of high-frequency component (LnHF), the short-term scaling parameters from detrended fluctuation and magnitude and sign analyses such as (α1, α1(MAG), α1(SIGN)), and the sample entropy (SampEn). We found statistical differences (p<0.05) for RMSSD among P and L-NC/L-C groups (25 ± 13 vs. 36 ± 14/34 ± 16 ms) and for LnHF between P and L-NC (5.37 ± 1.15 vs. 6.05 ± 0.86 ms(2)). Likewise, we identified statistical differences (p<0.05) for α1(SIGN) among P and L-NC/L-C groups (0.19 ± 0.20 vs. 0.32 ± 0.17/0.39 ± 0.13). By contrast, L-NC and L-C groups showed statistical differences (p<0.05) in α1(MAG) (0.67 ± 0.12 vs. 0.79 ± 0.12), and SampEn (1.62 ± 0.26 vs. 1.20 ± 0.44). These results suggest that during labour, despite preserving a concomitant non-linear influence, the maternal short-term cardiac autonomic regulation becomes weakly anticorrelated (as indicated by α1(SIGN)); furthermore, an increased vagally mediated activity is observed (as indicated by RMSSD and LnHF), which may reflect a cholinergic pathway activation owing to the use of oxytocin or the anti-inflammatory cholinergic response triggered during labour.

N2  - Heart Rate Variability (HRV) analysis can be of precious help in most of clinical  situations because it is able to quantify the Autonomic Nervous System (ANS) activity. The HRV high frequency (HF) content, related to the parasympathetic tone, reflects the ANS response to an external stimulus responsible of pain, stress or various emotions. We have previously developed the Analgesia Nociception Index (ANI), based on HRV high frequency content estimation, which quantifies continuously the vagal tone in order to guide analgesic drug administration during general anesthesia. This technology has been largely validated during the peri-operative period. Currently, ANI is obtained from a specific algorithm analyzing a time series representing successive heart periods measured on the electrocardiographic (ECG) signal. In the perspective of widening the application fields of this technology, in particular for homecare monitoring, it has become necessary to simplify signal acquisition by using e.g. a pulse plethysmographic (PPG) sensor. Even if Pulse Rate Variability (PRV) analysis issued from PPG sensors has been shown to be unreliable and a bad predictor of HRV analysis results, we have compared PRV and HRV both estimated by ANI as well as HF and HF/(HF+LF) spectral analysis on both signals.

N2  - Multifractal properties of electrocardiographic inter-beat (RR) time-series offer  insight into its long-term correlation structure, independently of RR variability. Here we quantify multifractal characteristics of RR data during 24-h diurnal-nocturnal activity in healthy participants. We tested the hypotheses that (1) age, gender and aerobic fitness influence RR multifractal properties, and that (2) these are influenced by circadian variation. Seventy adults (39 males) aged 19-58 years and of various fitness levels were monitored using 24-h ECG. Participants were dichotomized by median age and fitness for sub-group analysis. Gender and fitness were independent of age (p = 0.1, p > 0.5). Younger/older group ages were substantially different (p < 0.0005) and were independent of gender and fitness. Multifractality was quantified using the probability spectrum of Hölder exponents (h), from which modal h (h(*)) and the full-width and half-widths at half-maximum measures (FWHM, HWHM+, and HWHM-) were derived. FWHM decreased (p = 0.004) and h(*) increased (p = 0.011) in older people, indicating diminished long-range RR correlations and weaker anti-persistent behavior. Anti-persistent correlation (h(*)) was strongest in the youngest/fittest individuals and weakest in the oldest/least fit individuals (p = 0.015). Long-range correlation (HWHM+/FWHM) was strongest in the fittest males and weakest in the least fit females (p = 0.007-0.033). Multifractal RR characteristics in our healthy participants showed strong age-dependence, with diminished long-range anti-persistent correlation in older people. Circadian variation of these characteristics was influenced by fitness and gender: fitter males and females of all ages had the greatest degree of multifractality or long-range order. Multifractal characterization appears to be a useful method for exploring the physiological basis of long-term correlation structure in RR time-series as well as the benefits thereon of physical fitness training.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Phonocardiography, the digital recording of heart sounds, is becoming  increasingly popular as a primary detection system for diagnosing heart disorders and is relatively inexpensive. The electrocardiogram (ECG) is often used when recording the phonocardiogram in order to help identify the systolic and diastolic components. In this study, a heart sound segmentation algorithm has been developed which automatically separates the heart sound signal into these component parts. METHODS: 100 patients with normal and abnormal heart sounds were studied. The algorithm uses homomorphic filtering to produce time-domain intensity envelopes of the heart sounds and separates the sounds into four overlapping parts: the first heart sound, the systolic period, the second heart sound and the diastolic period. RESULTS: The performance of the algorithm was evaluated using 14,000 cardiac periods from 100 digital phonocardiographic recordings, including normal and abnormal heart sounds. In tests, the algorithm was over 93 percent correct in detecting the first and second heart sounds. CONCLUSION: The automatic segmentation algorithm presented uses wavelet decomposition and reconstruction to select a suitable frequency band for envelope calculations and has been found to be effective in segmenting phonocardiogram signals into four component parts without using an ECG reference.

N2  - Vital signs monitoring is ubiquitous in clinical environments and emerging in  home-based healthcare applications. Still, since current monitoring methods require uncomfortable sensors, respiration rate remains the least measured vital sign. In this paper, we propose a video-based respiration monitoring method that automatically detects a respiratory region of interest (RoI) and signal using a camera. Based on the observation that respiration induced chest/abdomen motion is an independent motion system in a video, our basic idea is to exploit the intrinsic properties of respiration to find the respiratory RoI and extract the respiratory signal via motion factorization. We created a benchmark dataset containing 148 video sequences obtained on adults under challenging conditions and also neonates in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). The measurements obtained by the proposed video respiration monitoring (VRM) method are not significantly different from the reference methods (guided breathing or contact-based ECG; p-value  =  0.6), and explain more than 99% of the variance of the reference values with low limits of agreement (-2.67 to 2.81 bpm). VRM seems to provide a valid solution to ECG in confined motion scenarios, though precision may be reduced for neonates. More studies are needed to validate VRM under challenging recording conditions, including upper-body motion types.

N2  - We developed an automatic slow-wave sleep (SWS) detection algorithm that can be  applied to groups of healthy subjects and patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). This algorithm detected SWS based on autonomic activations derived from the heart rate variations of a single sensor. An autonomic stability, which is an SWS characteristic, was evaluated and quantified using R-R intervals from an electrocardiogram (ECG). The thresholds and the heuristic rule to determine SWS were designed based on the physiological backgrounds for sleep process and distribution across the night. The automatic algorithm was evaluated based on a fivefold cross validation using data from 21 healthy subjects and 24 patients with OSA. An epoch-by-epoch (30 s) analysis showed that the overall Cohen's kappa, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of our method were 0.56, 89.97%, 68.71%, and 93.75%, respectively. SWS-related information, including SWS duration (min) and percentage (%), were also calculated. A significant correlation in these parameters was found between automatic and polysomnography scorings. Compared with similar methods, the proposed algorithm convincingly discriminated SWS from non-SWS. The simple method using only R-R intervals has the potential to be utilized in mobile and wearable devices that can easily measure this information. Moreover, when combined with other sleep staging methods, the proposed method is expected to be applicable to long-term sleep monitoring at home and ambulatory environments.

N2  - There was investigated the dynamics of the functional state of the cardiovascular  system of students after bicycle exercise load, followed by cold inhalation of lavender oil. Examinations were performed in the first half of the day at the same time, three times: 1) before exercise load (the state ofphysiological norm); 2) immediately after the load for 15minutes on the bike training apparatus «Proteus Pec 3320» in the third position, followed by aromatherapy; 3) at the 15 minute of the post-exercise load recovery period. Aromacorrection was executed by the method of cold inhalation. Registration and analysis of ECG by variation pulsometry was implemented by hardware-software complex, which combined the portable electrocardiograph of brand “Bio-Arm 001”, a personal computer and software for automatic recording and analysis of ECG with the method of variation pulsometry according to parameters of the cardiac rhythm. In the absence of correction factors (control group) the work on a stationary bike was established to be accompanied by significant deviations of all investigated parameters of the heart rhythm, the majority of which persisted at the 15 minute of the post-exercise load period also. Inhalation with the essential lavender oil (control group) under the bicycle load has a sedative effect on the activity of regulatory mechanisms of heart rhythm students. Releasing of the increased sympathetic influence on heart rate, initiated by the physical activity, it facilitates the rapid recovery of the functional state of the body in the post-exercise load period, thereby promoting its tolerance to effects of stress factors.

N2  - This paper introduces a methodology for the detection of sleep apnea based on  single-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) of the patient. In the proposed technique, each QRS complex of the ECG signal is approximated using a linear combination of the lower order Hermite basis functions. The coefficients of the Hermite expansion are then used to discriminate the apnea and normal segments along with three features based on R-R time series (mean of R-R intervals, the standard deviation of R-R intervals) and energy in the error of the QRS approximation. To perform classification between the apnea and normal segments, four different types of classifiers (K-nearest neighbor (KNN), multilayer perceptron neural network (MLPNN), support vector machine (SVM), and least-square support vector machine (LS-SVM)) are used in this work. In total, 70 ECG recordings from Apnea-ECG dataset are used in this study and the performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated based on the minute-by-minute (per-segment) classification, and per-recording (where the entire ECG recording of a subject is discriminated as the apnea or normal one) classification. By considering the events of apnea and hypopnea together, an accuracy of about 84% is achieved on the minute-by-minute basis classification using the LS-SVM classifier with the Gaussian radial basis function (RBF) kernel. On the other hand, an accuracy of about 97.14% is achieved for per-recording classification using the SVM, and LS-SVM classifiers. From the results, it is observed that the proposed methodology provides comparable accuracy with the methods existing in the literature at reduced computational cost due to the lesser number of features selected for the classification.

N2  - Low-power wearable recording of biopotentials requires acquisition front-ends with  high common-mode rejection for interference suppression and adjustable gain to provide an optimum signal range to a cascading analogue-to-digital stage. A microcontroller operated double-differential (DD) recording setup and automatic gain control circuit (AGC) are discussed which reject common-mode interference and provide tunable gain, thus compensating for imbalance and variation in electrode interface impedance. Custom-designed variable gain amplifiers (ASIC) are used as part of the recording setup. The circuit gain and balance is set by the timing of microcontroller generated clock signals. Measured results are presented which confirm that improved common-mode rejection is achieved compared to a single differential amplifier in the presence of input network imbalance. Practical measured examples further validate gain control suitable for biopotential recording and power-line rejection for wearable ECG and EMG recording. The prototype front-end consumes 318 μW including amplifiers and microcontroller.

N2  - Heart rate and respiration display fluctuations that are interlinked by central  regulatory mechanisms of the autonomic nervous system (ANS). Joint assessment of respiratory time series along with heart rate variability (HRV) may therefore provide information on ANS dysfunction. The aim of this study was to investigate cardio-respiratory interaction in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), a neurodegenerative disorder that is associated with progressive ANS dysfunction. Short-term ECG and respiration were recorded in 25 PD patients and 28 healthy controls during rest. To assess ANS dysfunction we analyzed joint symbolic dynamics of heart rate and respiration, cardio-respiratory synchrograms along with heart rate variability. Neither HRV nor cardio-respiratory synchrograms were significantly altered in PD patients. Symbolic analysis, however, identified a significant reduction in cardio-respiratory interactions in PD patients compared to healthy controls (16 ± 3.6 % vs. 20 ± 6.1 %; p= 0.02). In conclusion, joint symbolic analysis of cardio-respiratory dynamics provides a powerful tool to detect early signs of autonomic nervous system dysfunction in Parkinson's disease patients at an early stage of the disease.

N2  - This paper presents a novel maximum margin clustering method with immune evolution  (IEMMC) for automatic diagnosis of electrocardiogram (ECG) arrhythmias. This diagnostic system consists of signal processing, feature extraction, and the IEMMC algorithm for clustering of ECG arrhythmias. First, raw ECG signal is processed by an adaptive ECG filter based on wavelet transforms, and waveform of the ECG signal is detected; then, features are extracted from ECG signal to cluster different types of arrhythmias by the IEMMC algorithm. Three types of performance evaluation indicators are used to assess the effect of the IEMMC method for ECG arrhythmias, such as sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. Compared with K-means and iterSVR algorithms, the IEMMC algorithm reflects better performance not only in clustering result but also in terms of global search ability and convergence ability, which proves its effectiveness for the detection of ECG arrhythmias.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Detecting asymptomatic and undiagnosed atrial fibrillation (AF) is  increasingly important. Recently, we developed a wristwatch-based pulse wave monitor (PWM; Seiko Epson, Japan) capable of long-term recording, with an automatic diagnosis algorithm that uses frequency-based pulse wave analysis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the validity of continuous pulse wave monitoring for detection of AF. METHODS: During the electrophysiological study (EPS) in patients with AF, simultaneous pulse wave monitoring and Holter electrocardiograms (ECG) were recorded (n = 136, mean age 62.7 ± 10.9 years). The diagnostic accuracy of the PWM for AF was compared to the Holter ECG diagnosis. Standard performance metrics (sensitivity [Se], specificity [Sp], positive predictive value [PPV], and negative predictive value [NPV]) were calculated. The duration-based measurements were based on the diagnosis concordance ratios for the duration of time between diagnosis detected by the PWM and true diagnosis by the Holter ECG (AF or not AF). The episode-based performance metrics were based on the proportion of episodes appropriately detected with the PWM relative to episodes determined by the Holter ECG. RESULTS: The total recording time was 1,542,770 s (AF: 270,945 s). A high diagnostic Sp (patient average: 96.4%, cumulative: 97.7%) and NPV (patient average: 95.1%, cumulative: 96.8%) were obtained in the duration-based results. In the episode-based metrics, all indices significantly improved with longer AF episode durations. CONCLUSIONS: Continuous pulse wave monitoring can provide accurate and dependable information to aid in AF diagnosis. A high validity in confirming freedom from AF was shown by a high NPV.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Dynamic analysis techniques may quantify abnormalities in heart rate  variability (HRV) based on nonlinear and fractal analysis (chaos theory). The article emphasizes clinical and prognostic significance of dynamic changes in short-time series applied on patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) during the exercise electrocardiograph (ECG) test. METHODS: The subjects were included in the series after complete cardiovascular diagnostic data. Series of R-R and ST-T intervals were obtained from exercise ECG data after sampling digitally. The range rescaled analysis method determined the fractal dimension of the intervals. To quantify fractal long-range correlation's properties of heart rate variability, the detrended fluctuation analysis technique was used. Approximate entropy (ApEn) was applied to quantify the regularity and complexity of time series, as well as unpredictability of fluctuations in time series. RESULTS: It was found that the short-term fractal scaling exponent (alpha(1)) is significantly lower in patients with CHD (0.93 +/- 0.07 vs 1.09 +/- 0.04; P < 0.001). The patients with CHD had higher fractal dimension in each exercise test program separately, as well as in exercise program at all. ApEn was significant lower in CHD group in both RR and ST-T ECG intervals (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The nonlinear dynamic methods could have clinical and prognostic applicability also in short-time ECG series. Dynamic analysis based on chaos theory during the exercise ECG test point out the multifractal time series in CHD patients who loss normal fractal characteristics and regularity in HRV. Nonlinear analysis technique may complement traditional ECG analysis.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Postoperative atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with increased  morbidity, mortality, and resource utilization. Current prediction models for postoperative AF are based primarily on Western populations. In this study, we sought to develop a clinical prediction rule for postcardiac surgery AF for a multiethnic Asian population. METHODS: Two thousand one hundred sixty-eight patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft or valve surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass were prospectively enrolled in this observational study between August 2008 and July 2012 at Singapore's 2 national heart centers. Postoperative AF was defined as an irregularly irregular electrocardiogram rhythm without identifiable P wave after surgery and before hospital discharge that lasted more than an hour, or affected hemodynamics (ie, systolic blood pressure <90 mm Hg or mean arterial blood pressure <60 mm Hg), or required medical treatment. Patients had continuous telemetry monitoring for at least 72 hours while in the intensive care or high-dependency units postoperatively. Subsequently, patients had a 12-lead electrocardiogram daily and when symptomatic. Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine significant predictors of postcardiac surgery AF, and a scoring system was developed. The model was internally validated in an additional 500 patients. RESULTS: Postoperative AF occurred in 17.3% of patients, with a peak occurrence in the first 72 hours after surgery. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified age ≥65 years (odds ratio [OR], 1.44; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.11-1.85, P = 0.005), history of AF (OR, 3.65; 95% CI, 2.52-5.30, P < 0.001), inotrope use (OR, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.31-2.32, P < 0.001), cardiopulmonary bypass duration >120 minutes (OR, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.47-2.52, P < 0.001), and Chinese ethnicity (Chinese versus Indian OR, 2.09; 95% CI, 1.28-3.41, P = 0.003) or Malay (Malay versus Indian OR, 2.43; 95% CI, 1.36-4.05, P = 0.002) to be independently associated with postoperative AF. The area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve of the model was 0.704 (95% CI, 0.674-0.734). Internal validation produced an area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve of 0.756 (95% CI, 0.690-0.821). CONCLUSIONS: Clinical risk factors for AF after cardiac surgery in an Asian population are similar to that reported from primarily Western populations, but specific ethnicity influences susceptibility.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: Sleep is regulated by circadian and homeostatic processes and is highly  organized temporally. Our study was designed to determine whether this organization is preserved in patients receiving mechanical ventilation (MV) and intravenous sedation. DESIGN: Observational study. SETTING: Academic medical intensive care unit. PATIENTS: Critically ill patients receiving MV and intravenous sedation. METHODS: Continuous polysomnography (PSG) was initiated an average of 2.0 (1.0, 3.0) days after ICU admission and continued ≥ 36 h or until the patient was extubated. Sleep staging and power spectral analysis were performed using standard approaches. We also calculated the electroencephalography spectral edge frequency 95% SEF₉₅, a parameter that is normally higher during wakefulness than during sleep. Circadian rhythmicity was assessed in 16 subjects through the measurement of aMT6s in urine samples collected hourly for 24-48 hours. Light intensity at the head of the bed was measured continuously. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: We analyzed 819.7 h of PSG recordings from 21 subjects. REM sleep was identified in only 2/21 subjects. Slow wave activity lacked the normal diurnal and ultradian periodicity and homeostatic decline found in healthy adults. In nearly all patients, SEF₉₅ was consistently low without evidence of diurnal rhythmicity (median 6.3 [5.3, 7.8] Hz, n = 18). A circadian rhythm of aMT6s excretion was present in most (13/16, 81.3%) patients, but only 4 subjects had normal timing. Comparison of the SEF₉₅ during the melatonin-based biological night and day revealed no difference between the 2 periods (P = 0.64). CONCLUSIONS: The circadian rhythms and PSG of patients receiving mechanical ventilation and intravenous sedation exhibit pronounced temporal disorganization. The finding that most subjects exhibited preserved, but phase delayed, excretion of aMT6s suggests that the circadian pacemaker of such patients may be free-running.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Methadone represents today the gold standard of efficacy for the  pharmacological treatment of opioid dependence. Methadone, like many other medications, has been implicated in the prolongation of the rate-corrected QT (QTc) interval of the electrocardiogram (ECG), which is considered a marker for arrhythmias such as torsade de pointes (TdP). Indications on the association between methadone, even at therapeutic dosages, and TdP or sudden cardiac death have been reported. On these bases, consensus and recommendations involving QTc screening of patients receiving methadone treatment have been developed to identify patients with QTc above the thresholds considered at risk for cardiac arrhythmias, and they provide these individuals with alternative treatment (reduction of methadone dosage; provision of alternative opioid agonist treatment; treatment of associated risk factors). OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy and acceptability of QTc screening for preventing cardiac-related morbidity and mortality in methadone-treated opioid dependents. SEARCH METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL (to April 2013), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), The Cochrane Library Cochrane Drug and Alcohol Review Group Specialised Register (Issue 3, 2013), main electronic sources of ongoing trials, specific trial databases and reference lists of all relevant papers. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), controlled clinical trials (CCTs) and non-randomised studies (cohort studies, controlled before and after studies, interrupted time series studies, case control studies) examining the efficacy of QTc screening for the prevention of methadone-related mortality and morbidity in opioid addicts. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently screened and extracted data from studies. MAIN RESULTS: The search strategy led to the identification of 872 records. Upon full-text assessment, no study was found to meet the quality criteria used for this review. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: It is not possible to draw any conclusions about the effectiveness of QTc screening strategies for preventing cardiac morbidity/mortality in methadone-treated opioid addicts. Research efforts should focus on strengthening the evidence about the effectiveness of widespread implementation of such strategies and clarifying the associated benefits and harms.

N2  - The benefit of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) therapy depends upon  appropriate evaluation of a persisting risk of sudden death and estimation of the patient's overall survival. Assessment of a stable and unchangeable arrhythmogenic substrate is often difficult. Structural abnormality and ventricular dysfunction, the two major risk parameters, may recover, and heart failure symptoms can improve so that ICD therapy may not be indicated. Risk stratification can take time while the patient continues to be at high risk of arrhythmic death, and patients may need temporary bridging by a defibrillator in cases of interrupted ICD therapy. The wearable cardioverter-defibrillator (WCD) combines a long-term electrocardiogram (ECG)-monitoring system with an external automatic defibrillator. The LIfeVest® (ZOLL, Pittsburgh, PA, USA) is composed of a garment, containing two defibrillation patch electrodes on the back, and an elastic belt with a front-defibrillation patch electrode and four non-adhesive ECG electrodes, connected to a monitoring and defibrillation unit. The WCD is a safe and effective tool to terminate ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation events, unless a conscious patient withholds shock delivery. It may be used in patients in the early phase after acute myocardial infarction with poor left ventricular function, after acute coronary revascularization procedures (percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass grafting) and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (≤35%), in patients with acute heart failure in non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy of uncertain aetiology and prognosis. The WCD may be helpful in subjects with syncope of assumed tachyarrhythmia origin or in patients with inherited arrhythmia syndromes. The WCD may replace ICD implantation in patients waiting for heart transplantation or who need a ventricular-assist device. This review describes the technical details and characteristics of the WCD, discusses its various potential applications, and reports the currently available experience with the wearable defibrillator.

N2  - Early life stress in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) predisposes premature  infants to adverse health outcomes. Although those patients experience frequent apneas and sleep-wake disturbances during their hospital stay, clinicians still rely on clinical scales to assess pain and stress burden. This study addresses the relationship between stress and apneic spells in NICU patients to implement an automatic stress detector. EEG, ECG and SpO(2) were recorded from 40 patients for at least 3 hours and the stress burden was assessed using the Leuven Pain Scale. Different logistic regression models were designed to detect the presence or the absence of stress based on the signals reactivity to each apneic spell. The classification shows that stress can be detected with an area under the curve of 0.94 and a misclassification error of 19.23%. These results were obtained via SpO(2) dips and EEG regularity. These findings suggest that stress deepens the physiological reaction to apneas, which could ultimately impact the neurological and behavioral development.

N2  - The development of new technology such as wearables that record high-quality single  channel ECG, provides an opportunity for ECG screening in a larger population, especially for atrial fibrillation screening. The main goal of this study is to develop an automatic classification algorithm for normal sinus rhythm (NSR), atrial fibrillation (AF), other rhythms (O), and noise from a single channel short ECG segment (9-60 s). For this purpose, we combined a signal quality index (SQI) algorithm, to assess noisy instances, and trained densely connected convolutional neural networks to classify ECG recordings. Two convolutional neural network (CNN) models (a main model that accepts 15 s ECG segments and a secondary model that processes shorter 9 s segments) were trained using the training data set. If the recording is determined to be of low quality by SQI, it is immediately classified as noisy. Otherwise, it is transformed to a time-frequency representation and classified with the CNN as NSR, AF, O, or noise. The results achieved on the 2017 PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology challenge test dataset were an overall F(1) score of 0.82 (F(1) for NSR, AF, and O were 0.91, 0.83, and 0.72, respectively). Compared with 80 challenge entries, this was the third best overall score achieved on the evaluation dataset.

N2  - Recently, an electrically assisted bicycle has been widely used in daily life and  becomes very popular. The user selects the stepwise assist-mode to determine the assistive torque for pleasurable running. From the viewpoint of improvement of health by exercise, the electrically assisted bicycle can be an exercise machine like a treadmill. The heart rate (HR) is regarded as an indication of exercise load. This paper presents an automatic assist-mode selection system based on the HR of the bicycle user. The HR is obtained from the R-waves measured by the proposed wearable electrocardiograph on the user. The mode-selection system is simply implemented by a personal computer, USB-connected interface, and some electronic switching circuits. The running experiments confirm that the proposed assist-mode selection method has practicability.

N2  - Atrial fibrillation (AF) is usually detected by inspection of the electrocardiogram  waveform, a task made difficult when the signal is distorted by noise. The RR interval time series is more frequently available and accurate, yet linear and nonlinear time series analyses that detect highly varying and irregular AF are vulnerable to the common finding of frequent ectopy. We hypothesized that different nonlinear measures might capture characteristic features of AF, normal sinus rhythm (NSR), and sinus rhythm (SR) with frequent ectopy in ways that linear measures might not. To test this, we studied 2722 patients with 24 h ECG recordings in the University of Virginia Holter database. We found dynamical phenotypes for the three rhythm classifications. As expected, AF records had the highest variability and entropy, and NSR the lowest. SR with ectopy could be distinguished from AF, which had higher entropy, and from NSR, which had different fractal scaling, measured as higher detrended fluctuation analysis slope. With these dynamical phenotypes, we developed successful classification strategies, and the nonlinear measures improved on the use of mean and variability alone, even after adjusting for age. Final models using all variables had excellent performance, with positive predictive values for AF, NSR and SR with ectopy as high as 97, 98 and 90%, respectively. Since these classifiers can reliably detect rhythm changes utilizing segments as short as 10 min, we envision their application in noisy settings and in personal monitoring devices where only RR interval time series may be available.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To examine cardioprotective effects of Ρ-terminal fragment of adipokine  apelin-12 (A12), its novel structural analogue [MeArg(1), NLe(10)]-A12 (I), and [d-Ala(12)]-A12 (II), a putative antagonist of APJ receptor, employing in vivo model of ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Peptides were synthesized by the automatic solid phase method using Fmoc technology. Anesthetized open-chest male Wistar rats were subjected to left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery occlusion and coronary reperfusion. Hemodynamic variables and electrocardiogram (ECG) were monitored throughout the experiment. Myocardial injury was assessed by infarct size (IS), activity of necrosis markers in plasma, and metabolic state of the area at risk (AAR). RESULTS: Intravenous injection of A12, I, or II at the onset of reperfusion led to a transient reduction of the mean arterial pressure. A12 or I administration decreased the percent ratio of IS/AAR by 40% and 30%, respectively, compared with control animals which received saline. Both peptides improved preservation of high-energy phosphates, reduced lactate accumulation in the AAR, and lowered CK-MB and LDH activities in plasma at the end of reperfusion compared with these indices in control. Treatment with II did not significantly affect either the IS/AAR, % ratio, or activities of both markers of necrosis compared with control. The overall metabolic protection of the AAR in the treated groups increased in the following rank: II < A12 < I. CONCLUSIONS: The structural analogue of apelin-12 [MeArg(1), NLe(10)]-A12 may be a promising basis to create a new drug for the treatment of acute coronary syndrome.

N2  - AIM: The aim of study is a detection of ventricular and supraventricular wide QRS  arrhythmias using complex of morphological criteria and algorithms by method of automatic analysis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: For 100 patients (m/f - 61/39, Me (min; max) - 44.5 (10; 85) years) of researched group the analysis of 14306 single wide ectopic complexes (QRS 120-230 ms) has been done. Wide complexes include 11028 (77%) ventricular complexes and 3278 (23%) supraventricular complexes represented by 145 different forms of QRS. For verification of arrhythmias origin transesophageal ECG recording and endocardial electrophysiological study were done. The control group included 59 patients (m/f - 25/34, Me (min; max) - 49.5 (14,85) years) with 720 wide QRS, including 467 (65%) ventricular and 253 (35%) supraventricular complexes represented by 86 forms of QRS. The criteria Drew B.J., Scheinman M.M. (1995); Wellens H.J. (1978), RWPT II (Pava LF, 2010) and the algorithms of Brugada P. (1991); Bayesian (2000); Vereckei A. (2008) were used to evaluate sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic accuracy of wide QRS complexes recognition one by one and together, using the method of Wald sequential automatic analysis (KT Result3, CJSC INCART, Russia) and method of artificial neural networks. RESULTS: The best results for the detection of ventricular arrhythmias algorithms were demonstrated by the Brugada  P., Drew  B.J., Scheinman  M.M. algorithm (sensitivity 86.43%, specificity 66.73%, diagnostic accuracy 82.14% in the study group, sensitivity 81.80%, specificity 73.12%, diagnostic accuracy 78.75% in the control group), and the Bayesian algorithm (sensitivity 87.81%, specificity 73.62%, diagnostic accuracy 84.72% in the study group, sensitivity 83.30%, specificity 77.08%, diagnostic accuracy 81.11% in the control group). A complex analysis of the Wald method recognized ventricular arrhythmias in the research group with sensitivity 83.11%, specificity 83.65%, diagnostic accuracy 83.23% and in the control group with a sensitivity 83.51%, specificity of 84.58% and diagnostic accuracy 83.89%. Artificial neural networks recognized ventricular arrhythmias with sensitivity 91.43%, specificity 91.30% and diagnostic accuracy 91.39% in the control group and with sensitivity 97.06%, specificity 99.39% and diagnostic accuracy 97.6% in the research group. CONCLUSION: Automatic analysis allows obtaining simultaneously the results of each algorithms/criteria and in combination. It significantly reduces the doctor's work in assessing of amplitude-time characteristics of the complexes. Using artificial neural networks increases the accuracy of of ventricular and supraventricular arrhythmias recognition.

N2  - Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) syndrome is a common sleep disorder suffered by an  increasing number of people worldwide. As an alternative to polysomnography (PSG) for OSA diagnosis, the automatic OSA detection methods used in the current practice mainly concentrate on feature extraction and classifier selection based on collected physiological signals. However, one common limitation in these methods is that the temporal dependence of signals are usually ignored, which may result in critical information loss for OSA diagnosis. In this study, we propose a novel OSA detection approach based on ECG signals by considering temporal dependence within segmented signals. A discriminative hidden Markov model (HMM) and corresponding parameter estimation algorithms are provided. In addition, subject-specific transition probabilities within the model are employed to characterize the subject-to-subject differences of potential OSA patients. To validate our approach, 70 recordings obtained from the Physionet Apnea-ECG database were used. Accuracies of 97.1% for per-recording classification and 86.2% for per-segment OSA detection with satisfactory sensitivity and specificity were achieved. Compared with other existing methods that simply ignore the temporal dependence of signals, the proposed HMM-based detection approach delivers more satisfactory detection performance and could be extended to other disease diagnosis applications.

N2  - BACKGROUND: We have previously developed a novel digital tool capable of  automatically recognizing correct electrocardiography (ECG) diagnoses in an online exam and demonstrated a significant improvement in diagnostic accuracy when utilizing an inductive-deductive reasoning strategy over a pattern recognition strategy. In this study, we sought to validate these findings from participants at the International Winter Arrhythmia School meeting, one of the foremost electrophysiology events in Canada. METHODS: Preregistration to the event was sent by e-mail. The exam was administered on day 1 of the conference. Results and analysis were presented the following morning to participants. RESULTS: Twenty-five attendees completed the exam, providing a total of 500 responses to be marked. The online tool accurately identified 195 of a total of 395 (49%) correct responses (49%). In total, 305 responses required secondary manual review, of which 200 were added to the correct responses pool. The overall accuracy of correct ECG diagnosis for all participants was 69% and 84% when using pattern recognition or inductive-deductive strategies, respectively. CONCLUSION: Utilization of a novel digital tool to evaluate ECG competency can be set up as a workshop at international meetings or educational events. Results can be presented during the sessions to ensure immediate feedback.

N2  - Long-term ECG is widely used in diagnosis and assessment of many cardiac symptoms  which may be caused by dangerous arrhythmias that sometimes can be difficult to document. The PocketECG system is a new technological solution for a long-term, noninvasive, continuous and real-time ECG monitoring that provides automatic diagnosis of dysrhythmias. ECG data transmission occurs over a mobile network. The goal of this study was to assess the reliability of long-term ECG recordings acquired with the PocketECG system. One hundred and fifteen patients (43 girls and 72 boys) of an average age of 15.5 ± 2.5 years were examined at the Department of Cardiology at the Children's Memorial Health Institute. Two simultaneous 24-h ECG recordings were conducted: one with a Holter monitor and one with the PocketECG system. A linear correlation was demonstrated between the two methods with regard to the recorded QRS complexes [H = 1173.0 (-1946.40; 4838.50) + PocketECG*0.98 (0.94; 1.02)]. Mean diurnal heart rhythms were comparable (p > 0.05) despite the fact that the slowest and the fastest rates were different. The rate of detection for ventricular, supraventricular dysrhythmias and pauses in ventricular rhythm were comparable in both methods. The PocketECG system for continuous and real-time ECG recording is a reliable method for the assessment of heart rhythm and dysrhythmias in children and adolescents.

N2  - Electrocardiographic (ECG) T-wave endpoint (Tend) identification suffers lack of  reliability due to the presence of noise and variability among leads. Tend identification can be improved by using global repolarization waveforms obtained by combining several leads. The dominant T-wave (DTW) is a global repolarization waveform that proved to improve Tend identification when computed using the 15 (I to III, aVr, aVl, aVf, V1 to V6, X, Y, Z) leads usually available in clinics, of which only 8 (I, II, V1 to V6) are independent. The aim of the present study was to evaluate if the 8 independent leads are sufficient to obtain a DTW which allows a reliable Tend identification. To this aim Tend measures automatically identified from 15-dependent-lead DTWs of 46 control healthy subjects (CHS) and 103 acute myocardial infarction patients (AMIP) were compared with those obtained from 8-independent-lead DTWs. Results indicate that Tend distributions have not statistically different median values (CHS: 340 ms vs. 340 ms, respectively; AMIP: 325 ms vs. 320 ms, respectively), besides being strongly correlated (CHS: ρ=0.97, AMIP: 0.88; P<10(-27)). Thus, measuring Tend from the 15-dependent-lead DTWs is statistically equivalent to measuring Tend from the 8-independent-lead DTWs. In conclusion, for the clinical purpose of automatic Tend identification from DTW, the 8 independent leads can be used without a statistically significant loss of accuracy but with a significant decrement of computational effort. The lead dependence of 7 out of 15 leads does not introduce a significant bias in the Tend determination from 15 dependent lead DTWs.

N2  - Cardiac physiology is unique in neonates and infants; there are several physiologic  changes that occur in the first weeks of life. Important changes can be captured on the bedside monitor and provide vital data in a noninvasive way to providers. The importance of diligent observation cannot be overstated. Bedside monitoring has improved in the last decade, which has enhanced the ability to detect changes in heart rates and rhythms. The purpose here is to review cardiac physiology, describe those arrhythmias able to be observed on bedside monitors, and highlight heart rate changes that can be early signs of sepsis.

N2  - Vectorcardiogram (VCG) signals contain a wealth of dynamic information pertinent to  space-time cardiac electrical activities. However, few, if any, previous investigations have studied disease-altered nonlinear dynamics in the spatiotemporal VCG signals. Most previous nonlinear dynamic methods considered the time-delay reconstructed state space from a single ECG trace. This paper presents a novel multiscale recurrence approach to not only explore VCG recurrence dynamics but also resolve the issue of recurrence computation for the large-scale datasets. As opposed to the traditional single-scale recurrence analysis, we characterize and quantify the recurrence behaviours in multiple wavelet scales. In addition, wavelet dyadic subsampling enables the large-scale recurrence analysis, but it is used to be highly expensive for a long-term time series. The classification experiments show that multiscale recurrence analysis detects the myocardial infarctions from 3-lead VCG with an average sensitivity of 96.8% and specificity of 92.8%, which show superior performance (i.e., 5.6% improvements) to the single-scale recurrence analysis.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is an established treatment in  patients with heart failure and conduction abnormalities. However, a significant number of patients do not respond to CRT. Currently employed criteria for selection of patients for this therapy (QRS duration and morphology) have several shortcomings. QRS area was recently shown to provide superior association with CRT response. However, its assessment was not fully automated and required the presence of an expert. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to develop a fully automated method for the assessment of vector-cardiographic (VCG) QRS area from electrocardiographic (ECG) signals. METHODS: Pre-implantation ECG recordings (N = 864, 695 left-bundle-branch block, 589 men) in PDF files were converted to allow signal processing. QRS complexes were found and clustered into morphological groups. Signals were converted from 12‑lead ECG to 3‑lead VCG and an average QRS complex was built. QRS area was computed from individual areas in the X, Y and Z leads. Practical usability was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier plots and 5-year follow-up data. RESULTS: The automatically calculated QRS area values were 123 ± 48 μV.s (mean values and SD), while the manually determined QRS area values were 116 ± 51 ms; the correlation coefficient between the two was r = 0.97. The automated and manual methods showed the same ability to stratify the population (hazard ratios 2.09 vs 2.03, respectively). CONCLUSION: The presented approach allows the fully automatic and objective assessment of QRS area values. SIGNIFICANCE: Until this study, assessing QRS area values required an expert, which means both additional costs and a risk of subjectivity. The presented approach eliminates these disadvantages and is publicly available as part of free signal-processing software.

N2  - Recently, new patch type electrocardiogram (ECG) recorders have reached the market.  These new devices possess a number of advantages compared to the traditional Holter recorders. This forms the basis of questions related to benefits and drawbacks of different ambulatory ECG recording techniques. One of the important questions is the ability to obtain high clinical quality of the recordings during the entire monitoring period. It is thus desirable to be able to obtain an automatic estimate of the global quality of entire ECG recordings. The purpose of this pilot study is therefore to design an algorithm for automatic classification of entire ECG recordings into the groups "noisy" and "clean" recordings. This novel algorithm is based on three features and a simple Bayes classifier. The algorithm was tested on 40 ECG recordings in a five-fold cross validation scheme and it obtained an average accuracy of 90% on the test data.

N2  - An automatic method is presented for detecting myocardial ischemia, which can be  considered as the early symptom of acute coronary events. Myocardial ischemia commonly manifests as ST- and T-wave changes on ECG signals. The methods in this study are proposed to detect abnormal ECG beats using knowledge-based features and classification methods. A novel classification method, sparse representation-based classification (SRC), is involved to improve the performance of the existing algorithms. A comparison was made between two classification methods, SRC and support-vector machine (SVM), using rule-based vectors as input feature space. The two methods are proposed with quantitative evaluation to validate their performances. The results of SRC method encompassed with rule-based features demonstrate higher sensitivity than that of SVM. However, the specificity and precision are a trade-off. Moreover, SRC method is less dependent on the selection of rule-based features and can achieve high performance using fewer features. The overall performances of the two methods proposed in this study are better than the previous methods.

N2  - A variety of health and behavioral states can potentially be inferred from  physiological measurements that can now be collected in the natural free-living environment. The major challenge, however, is to develop computational models for automated detection of health events that can work reliably in the natural field environment. In this paper, we develop a physiologically-informed model to automatically detect drug (cocaine) use events in the free-living environment of participants from their electrocardiogram (ECG) measurements. The key to reliably detecting drug use events in the field is to incorporate the knowledge of autonomic nervous system (ANS) behavior in the model development so as to decompose the activation effect of cocaine from the natural recovery behavior of the parasympathetic nervous system (after an episode of physical activity). We collect 89 days of data from 9 active drug users in two residential lab environments and 922 days of data from 42 active drug users in the field environment, for a total of 11,283 hours. We develop a model that tracks the natural recovery by the parasympathetic nervous system and then estimates the dampening caused to the recovery by the activation of the sympathetic nervous system due to cocaine. We develop efficient methods to screen and clean the ECG time series data and extract candidate windows to assess for potential drug use. We then apply our model on the recovery segments from these windows. Our model achieves 100% true positive rate while keeping the false positive rate to 0.87/day over (9+ hours/day of) lab data and to 1.13/day over (11+ hours/day of) field data.

N2  - This paper describes a new method for automatic detection of obstructive sleep apnea  (OSA) based on artificial neural networks (ANN) using regular electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings. ECG signals were pre-processed and segmented to extract the P-waves; then three P-wave features were extracted: the P-wave duration (T ( p )), the P-wave dispersion (P ( d )), and the time interval from the peak of the P-wave to the R-wave (T ( pr )). Combinations of the three features were used as features for classification using ANN. For each feature combination studied, 70% of the input data was used for training the ANN, 15% for validating, and 15% for testing the results. Perfect agreement between expert's scores and the ANN scores was achieved when the ANN was applied on T ( p ), P ( d ), and T ( pr ) taken together, while substantial agreements were achieved when applying the ANN on the feature combinations T ( p ) and P ( d ), and T ( p ) and T ( pr ).

N2  - INTRODUCTION: False alarm reduction is an important challenge in self-care, whereas  one of the most important false alarm causes in the cardiology domain is electrodes misplacements in ECG recordings, the main investigations to perform for early and pervasive detection of cardiovascular diseases. In this context, we present and assess a new method for electrode reversals identification for Mason-Likar based 3D ECG recording systems which are especially convenient to use in self-care and allow to achieve, as previously reported, high computerized ischemia detection accuracy. METHODS: We mathematically simulate the effect of the six pairwise reversals of the LA, RA, LL, and C2 electrodes on the three ECG leads I, II, and V2. Our approach then consists in performing serial comparisons of the newly recorded 3D ECG and of the six derived ECGs simulating an electrode reversal with a standard, 12-lead reference ECG by means of the CAVIAR software. We further use a scoring method to compare these analysis results and then apply a decision tree model to extract the most relevant measurements in a learning set of 121 patients recorded in ICU. RESULTS: The comparison of the seven sets of serial analysis results from the learning set resulted in the determination of a composite criteria involving four measurements of spatial orientation changes of QRS and T and providing a reversal identification accuracy of 100%. Almost the same results, with 99.99% of sensitivity and 100% of specificity, were obtained in two test sets from 90 patients, composed of 2098 and 2036 representative ECG beats respectively recorded during PTCA balloon inflation, a procedure which mimics ischemia, and before PTCA for control. CONCLUSION: Personalized automatic detection of ECG electrode cable interchanges can reach almost the maximal accuracy of 100% in self-care, and can be performed in almost real time.

N2  - Digital electrocardiographs are now widely available and a large number of digital  electrocardiograms (ECGs) have been recorded and stored. The present study describes the development and clinical applications of a large database of such digital ECGs, namely the CODE (Clinical Outcomes in Digital Electrocardiology) study. ECGs obtained by the Telehealth Network of Minas Gerais, Brazil, from 2010 to 17, were organized in a structured database. A hierarchical free-text machine learning algorithm recognized specific ECG diagnoses from cardiologist reports. The Glasgow ECG Analysis Program provided Minnesota Codes and automatic diagnostic statements. The presence of a specific ECG abnormality was considered when both automatic and medical diagnosis were concordant; cases of discordance were decided using heuristisc rules and manual review. The ECG database was linked to the national mortality information system using probabilistic linkage methods. From 2,470,424 ECGs, 1,773,689 patients were identified. After excluding the ECGs with technical problems and patients <16 years-old, 1,558,415 patients were studied. High performance measures were obtained using an end-to-end deep neural network trained to detect 6 types of ECG abnormalities, with F1 scores >80% and specificity >99% in an independent test dataset. We also evaluated the risk of mortality associated with the presence of atrial fibrillation (AF), which showed that AF was a strong predictor of cardiovascular mortality and mortality for all causes, with increased risk in women. In conclusion, a large database that comprises all ECGs performed by a large telehealth network can be useful for further developments in the field of digital electrocardiography, clinical cardiology and cardiovascular epidemiology.

N2  - Central venous pressure (CVP) is an important clinical parameter for physicians but  only the absolute CVP value is typically monitored in the intensive care unit (ICU). In this study, we propose a novel mathematical method to present and analyze CVP signals. A total of 44 suitable samples were chosen from a total of 65 collected in an ICU. Pre-processing of the samples included rate reduction and digital filtering. The statistical features of time and frequency domain, wavelet, and empirical mode decomposition of these signals were extracted. We found no significant difference among the CVP signals regarding sex, smoking, coronary disease, and respiration mode of the samples.

N2  - The understanding of heart rate variability (HRV) has increased parallel with the  development of modern physiology. Discovered probably first in 1847 by Ludwig, clinical applications evolved in the second part of the twentieth century. Today HRV is mostly used in cardiology and research settings. In general, HRV can be measured over shorter (e.g., 5-10 min) or longer (12 or 24 h) periods. Since 1996, most measurements and calculations are made according to the standard of the Task Force of the European Society of Cardiology and the North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology. As the first step, the series of times between successive R-peaks in the ECG are in milliseconds. It is crucial, however, to identify and remove extrasystoles and artifacts according to standard protocols. The series of QRS distances between successive heartbeats can be analyzed with simple or more sophisticated algorithms, beginning with standard deviation (SDNN) or by the square root of the mean of the sum of squares of differences between adjacent normal RR (rMSSD). Short-term HRV is frequently analyzed with the help of a non-parametric fast Fourier transformation quantifying the different frequency bands during the measurement period. In the last decades, various non-linear algorithms have been presented, such as different entropy and fractal measures or wavelet analysis. Although most of them have a strong theoretical foundation, their clinical relevance is still debated.

N2  - Automatic electrocardiogram (ECG) signal enhancement has become a crucial  pre-processing step in most ECG signal analysis applications. In this Letter, the authors propose an automated noise-aware dictionary learning-based generalised ECG signal enhancement framework which can automatically learn the dictionaries based on the ECG noise type for effective representation of ECG signal and noises, and can reduce the computational load of sparse representation-based ECG enhancement system. The proposed framework consists of noise detection and identification, noise-aware dictionary learning, sparse signal decomposition and reconstruction. The noise detection and identification is performed based on the moving average filter, first-order difference, and temporal features such as number of turning points, maximum absolute amplitude, zerocrossings, and autocorrelation features. The representation dictionary is learned based on the type of noise identified in the previous stage. The proposed framework is evaluated using noise-free and noisy ECG signals. Results demonstrate that the proposed method can significantly reduce computational load as compared with conventional dictionary learning-based ECG denoising approaches. Further, comparative results show that the method outperforms existing methods in automatically removing noises such as baseline wanders, power-line interference, muscle artefacts and their combinations without distorting the morphological content of local waves of ECG signal.

N2  - This paper proposes a low power and efficient QRS processor for real-time and  continuous mobile ECG monitoring. The QRS detector contains the wavelet transform (WT), the modulus maxima pair identification (MMPI), and the R position modification (RPM). In order to reduce power consumption, we choose the Haar function as the mother wavelet of WT. It is implemented by an optimized FIR filter structure where none of the multiplier is used. The MMPI processes the wavelet coefficients at scale 2(4) and provides candidate R peak positions for the RPM. To improve the accuracy and robust performance, a number of modules have been designed in MMPI, including the preprocessing unit, the automatic threshold updating, and the decision state machine. The RPM is designed to eliminate digital time delay in wavelet transform and locate the R peak position precisely. Raw ECG signals and QRS detection results are output simultaneously. Fabricated in 0.18-μm N-well CMOS 1P6M technology, the power consumption of this chip is only about 410 nW in 1 V voltage supply. Validated by all 48 sets of data in the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database, the sensitive and the positive prediction are 99.60% and 99.77% respectively.

N2  - Detection of QRS complexes in ECG signals is required for various purposes such as  determination of heart rate, feature extraction and classification. The problem of automatic QRS detection in ECG signals is complicated by the presence of noise spectrally overlapping with the QRS frequency range. As a solution to this problem, we propose the use of least-squares-optimisation-based smoothing techniques that suppress the noise peaks in the ECG while preserving the QRS complexes. We also propose a novel nonlinear transformation technique that is applied after the smoothing operations, which equalises the QRS amplitudes without boosting the supressed noise peaks. After these preprocessing operations, the R-peaks can finally be detected with high accuracy. The proposed technique has a low computational load and, therefore, it can be used for real-time QRS detection in a wearable device such as a Holter monitor or for fast offline QRS detection. The offline and real-time versions of the proposed technique have been evaluated on the standard MIT-BIH database. The offline implementation is found to perform better than state-of-the-art techniques based on wavelet transforms, empirical mode decomposition, etc. and the real-time implementation also shows improved performance over existing real-time QRS detection techniques.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to develop a small 1.5-T MRI system for  neonatal imaging that can be installed in the neonatal ICU (NICU) and to evaluate its performance in 15 neonates. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A 1.5-T MR system designed for orthopedic use was adapted for neonatal imaging. Modifications included raising and leveling the magnet, construction of a patient table, and integration of imaging electronics from a high-performance adult-sized scanner. The system was used to perform MR examinations of the brain, abdomen, and chest in 15 medically stable neonates using standard clinical protocols. The scanning time was limited to 60 minutes. The MR examinations were performed without administering sedation to the patients. ECG, heart rate, oxygen saturation, and temperature were monitored continuously throughout the examination. The images were evaluated by two pediatric radiologists for overall study quality, motion artifact, spatial resolution, signal-to-noise ratio, and contrast. RESULTS: All 15 neonates were successfully imaged without sedation. No adverse MRI-related events were noted. In total, 19 brain and seven abdominal examinations were performed. Six chest and two cardiac examinations were also obtained. Gross (versus physiologic) subject motion proved to be the most influential factor in determining overall study and image quality. High-quality diagnostic images were obtained at each anatomic location. CONCLUSION: The customized neonatal MRI system provides state-of-the-art MRI capabilities in the NICU.

N2  - Transcutaneous cervical vagal nerve stimulation (tcVNS) devices are attractive  alternatives to surgical implants, and can be applied for a number of conditions in ambulatory settings, including stress-related neuropsychiatric disorders. Transferring tcVNS technologies to at-home settings brings challenges associated with the assessment of therapy response. The ability to accurately detect whether tcVNS has been effectively delivered in a remote setting such as the home has never been investigated. We designed and conducted a study in which 12 human subjects received active tcVNS and 14 received sham stimulation in tandem with traumatic stress, and measured continuous cardiopulmonary signals including the electrocardiogram (ECG), photoplethysmogram (PPG), seismocardiogram (SCG), and respiratory effort (RSP). We extracted physiological parameters related to autonomic nervous system activity, and created a feature set from these parameters to: 1) detect active (vs. sham) tcVNS stimulation presence with machine learning methods, and 2) determine which sensing modalities and features provide the most salient markers of tcVNS-based changes in physiological signals. Heart rate (ECG), vasomotor activity (PPG), and pulse arrival time (ECG+PPG) provided sufficient information to determine target engagement (compared to sham) in addition to other combinations of sensors. resulting in 96% accuracy, precision, and recall with a receiver operator characteristics area of 0.96. Two commonly utilized sensing modalities (ECG and PPG) that are suitable for home use can provide useful information on therapy response for tcVNS. The methods presented herein could be deployed in wearable devices to quantify adherence for at-home use of tcVNS technologies.

N2  - Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death around the world. As a  result, low-cost biomedical sensors have been gaining importance in business and research over the last few decades. Their main benefits include their small size, light weight, portability and low power consumption. Despite these advantages, they are not generally used for clinical monitoring mainly because of their low accuracy in data acquisition. In this emerging technological context, this paper contributes by discussing a methodology to help practitioners build a prototype framework based on a low-cost commercial sensor. The resulting application consists of four modules; namely, a digitalization module whose input is an electrocardiograph signal in portable document format (PDF) or joint photographic expert group format (JPEG), a module to further process and filter the digitalized signal, a selectable data calibration module and, finally, a module implementing a classification algorithm to distinguish between individuals with normal sinus rhythms and those with atrial fibrillation. This last module employs our recently published symbolic recurrence quantification analysis (SRQA) algorithm on a time series of RR intervals. Moreover, we show that the algorithm applies to any biomedical low-cost sensor, achieving good results without requiring.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Polysomnography (PSG) is used to define physiological sleep and  different physiological sleep stages, to assess sleep quality and diagnose many types of sleep disorders such as obstructive sleep apnea. However, PSG requires not only the connection of various sensors and electrodes to the subject but also spending the night in a bed that is different from the subject's own bed. This study is designed to investigate the feasibility of automatic classification of sleep stages and obstructive apneaic epochs using only the features derived from a single-lead electrocardiography (ECG) signal. METHODS: For this purpose, PSG recordings (ECG included) were obtained during the night's sleep (mean duration 7 hours) of 17 subjects (5 men) with ages between 26 and 67. Based on these recordings, sleep experts performed sleep scoring for each subject. This study consisted of the following steps: (1) Visual inspection of ECG data corresponding to each 30-second epoch, and selection of epochs with relatively clean signals, (2) beat-to-beat interval (RR interval) computation using an R-peak detection algorithm, (3) feature extraction from RR interval values, and (4) classification of sleep stages (or obstructive apneaic periods) using one-versus-rest approach. The features used in the study were the median value, the difference between the 75 and 25 percentile values, and mean absolute deviations of the RR intervals computed for each epoch. The k-nearest-neighbor (kNN), quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA), and support vector machines (SVM) methods were used as the classification tools. In the testing procedure 10-fold cross-validation was employed. RESULTS: QDA and SVM performed similarly well and significantly better than kNN for both sleep stage and apneaic epoch classification studies. The classification accuracy rates were between 80 and 90% for the stages other than non-rapid-eye-movement stage 2. The accuracies were 60 or 70% for that specific stage. In five obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients, the accurate apneaic epoch detection rates were over 89% for QDA and SVM. CONCLUSION: This study, in general, showed that RR-interval based classification, which requires only single-lead ECG, is feasible for sleep stage and apneaic epoch determination and can pave the road for a simple automatic classification system suitable for home-use.

N2  - PURPOSE: Previous studies have shown that heart rate complexity may be a useful  indicator of patient status in the critical care environment but will require continuous, accurate, and automated R-wave detection (RWD) in the electrocardiogram (ECG). Although numerous RWD algorithms exist, accurate detection remains a challenge. The purpose of this study was to develop and validate a novel fusion algorithm (Automated Electrocardiogram Selection of Peaks, or AESOP) that combines the strengths of several well-known algorithms to provide a more reliable real-time solution to the RWD problem. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study involved the ECGs of 108 prehospital patient records and 32 ECGs from a conscious sedated porcine model of hemorrhagic shock. The criterion standard for validation was manual verification of R waves. RESULTS: For 108 human ECG records, the AESOP algorithm overall outperformed each of its component algorithms. In addition, for 32 swine ECG records, AESOP achieved an R-wave sensitivity of 97.9% and a positive predictive value of 97.5%, again outperforming its component algorithms. CONCLUSION: By fusing several best algorithms, AESOP uses the strengths of each algorithm to perform more robustly and reliably in real time. The AESOP algorithm will be integrated into a real-time heart rate complexity software program for decision support and triage in critically ill patients.

N2  - As non-invasive continuous blood pressure monitoring (NCBPM) has gained wide  attraction in the recent decades, many pulse arrival time (PAT) or pulse transit time (PTT) based blood pressure (BP) estimation studies have been conducted. However, most of the studies have used small homogeneous subject pools to generate models of BP based on particular interventions for induced hemodynamic change. In this study, a large open biosignal database from a diverse group of 2309 surgical patients was analyzed to assess the efficacy of PAT, PTT, and confounding factors on the estimation of BP. After pre-processing the dataset, a total of 6,777,308 data pairs of BP and temporal features between electrocardiogram (ECG) and photoplethysmogram (PPG) were extracted and analyzed. Correlation analysis revealed that PAT or PTT extracted from the intersecting-tangent (IT) point of PPG showed the highest mean correlation to BP. The mean correlation between PAT and systolic blood pressure (SBP) was -0.37 and the mean correlation between PAT and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was -0.30, outperforming the correlation between BP and PTT at -0.12 for SBP and -0.11 for DBP. A linear model of BP with a simple calibration method using PAT as a predictor was developed which satisfied international standards for automatic oscillometric BP monitors in the case of DBP, however, SBP could not be predicted to a satisfactory level due to higher errors. Furthermore, multivariate regression analyses showed that many confounding factors considered in previous studies had inconsistent effects on the degree of correlation between PAT and BP.

N2  - In this study, heartbeat time series are classified using support vector machines  (SVMs). Statistical methods and signal analysis techniques are used to extract features from the signals. The SVM classifier is favorably compared to other neural network-based classification approaches by performing leave-one-out cross validation. The performance of the SVM with respect to other state-of-the-art classifiers is also confirmed by the classification of signals presenting very low signal-to-noise ratio. Finally, the influence of the number of features to the classification rate was also investigated for two real datasets. The first dataset consists of long-term ECG recordings of young and elderly healthy subjects. The second dataset consists of long-term ECG recordings of normal subjects and subjects suffering from coronary artery disease.

N2  - BACKGROUND: In simultaneous EEG-fMRI, identification of the period of  cardioballistic artifact (BCG) in EEG is required for the artifact removal. Recording the electrocardiogram (ECG) waveform during fMRI is difficult, often causing inaccurate period detection. NEW METHOD: Since the waveform of the BCG extracted by independent component analysis (ICA) is relatively invariable compared to the ECG waveform, we propose a multiple-scale peak-detection algorithm to determine the BCG cycle directly from the EEG data. The algorithm first extracts the high contrast BCG component from the EEG data by ICA. The BCG cycle is then estimated by band-pass filtering the component around the fundamental frequency identified from its energy spectral density, and the peak of BCG artifact occurrence is selected from each of the estimated cycle. RESULTS: The algorithm is shown to achieve a high accuracy on a large EEG-fMRI dataset. It is also adaptive to various heart rates without the needs of adjusting the threshold parameters. The cycle detection remains accurate with the scan duration reduced to half a minute. Additionally, the algorithm gives a figure of merit to evaluate the reliability of the detection accuracy. COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHOD: The algorithm is shown to give a higher detection accuracy than the commonly used cycle detection algorithm fmrib_qrsdetect implemented in EEGLAB. CONCLUSIONS: The achieved high cycle detection accuracy of our algorithm without using the ECG waveforms makes possible to create and automate pipelines for processing large EEG-fMRI datasets, and virtually eliminates the need for ECG recordings for BCG artifact removal.

N2  - BACKGROUND: In Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance (CMR), the synchronization of image  acquisition with heart motion is performed in clinical practice by processing the electrocardiogram (ECG). The ECG-based synchronization is well established for MR scanners with magnetic fields up to 3 T. However, this technique is prone to errors in ultra high field environments, e.g. in 7 T MR scanners as used in research applications. The high magnetic fields cause severe magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) effects which disturb the ECG signal. Image synchronization is thus less reliable and yields artefacts in CMR images. METHODS: A strategy based on Independent Component Analysis (ICA) was pursued in this work to enhance the ECG contribution and attenuate the MHD effect. ICA was applied to 12-lead ECG signals recorded inside a 7 T MR scanner. An automatic source identification procedure was proposed to identify an independent component (IC) dominated by the ECG signal. The identified IC was then used for detecting the R-peaks. The presented ICA-based method was compared to other R-peak detection methods using 1) the raw ECG signal, 2) the raw vectorcardiogram (VCG), 3) the state-of-the-art gating technique based on the VCG, 4) an updated version of the VCG-based approach and 5) the ICA of the VCG. RESULTS: ECG signals from eight volunteers were recorded inside the MR scanner. Recordings with an overall length of 87 min accounting for 5457 QRS complexes were available for the analysis. The records were divided into a training and a test dataset. In terms of R-peak detection within the test dataset, the proposed ICA-based algorithm achieved a detection performance with an average sensitivity (Se) of 99.2%, a positive predictive value (+P) of 99.1%, with an average trigger delay and jitter of 5.8 ms and 5.0 ms, respectively. Long term stability of the demixing matrix was shown based on two measurements of the same subject, each being separated by one year, whereas an averaged detection performance of Se = 99.4% and +P = 99.7% was achieved.Compared to the state-of-the-art VCG-based gating technique at 7 T, the proposed method increased the sensitivity and positive predictive value within the test dataset by 27.1% and 42.7%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The presented ICA-based method allows the estimation and identification of an IC dominated by the ECG signal. R-peak detection based on this IC outperforms the state-of-the-art VCG-based technique in a 7 T MR scanner environment.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Elevated transient ischemic ST segment episodes in the ambulatory  electrocardiographic (AECG) records appear generally in patients with transmural ischemia (e. g. Prinzmetal's angina) while depressed ischemic episodes appear in patients with subendocardial ischemia (e. g. unstable or stable angina). Huge amount of AECG data necessitates automatic methods for analysis. We present an algorithm which determines type of transient ischemic episodes in the leads of records (elevations/depressions) and classifies AECG records according to type of ischemic heart disease (Prinzmetal's angina; coronary artery diseases excluding patients with Prinzmetal's angina; other heart diseases). METHODS: The algorithm was developed using 24-hour AECG records of the Long Term ST Database (LTST DB). The algorithm robustly generates ST segment level function in each AECG lead of the records, and tracks time varying non-ischemic ST segment changes such as slow drifts and axis shifts to construct the ST segment reference function. The ST segment reference function is then subtracted from the ST segment level function to obtain the ST segment deviation function. Using the third statistical moment of the histogram of the ST segment deviation function, the algorithm determines deflections of leads according to type of ischemic episodes present (elevations, depressions), and then classifies records according to type of ischemic heart disease. RESULTS: Using 74 records of the LTST DB (containing elevated or depressed ischemic episodes, mixed ischemic episodes, or no episodes), the algorithm correctly determined deflections of the majority of the leads of the records and correctly classified majority of the records with Prinzmetal's angina into the Prinzmetal's angina category (7 out of 8); majority of the records with other coronary artery diseases into the coronary artery diseases excluding patients with Prinzmetal's angina category (47 out of 55); and correctly classified one out of 11 records with other heart diseases into the other heart diseases category. CONCLUSIONS: The developed algorithm is suitable for processing long AECG data, efficient, and correctly classified the majority of records of the LTST DB according to type of transient ischemic heart disease.

N2  - The human heartbeat interval is determined by complex nerve control and  environmental inputs. As a result, the heartbeat interval for a human is a complex time series, as shown by previous studies. Most of the analysis algorithms proposed for characterizing the profile of heartbeat time series, such as detrended fluctuation analysis and multi-scale entropy, are based on various characteristics of dynamics. In this study, we present an empirical mode decomposition-based intrinsic mode analysis, which uses the appearance energy index (AEI) to quantify the property of long-term correlation, and structure index (SI) to characterize the internal modulation of data. This presented algorithm was used to investigate the human heartbeat time series downloaded from PhysioBank. We found the profiles of human heartbeat time series of subjects with congestive heart failure (CHF) or atrial fibrillation (AF) are significantly different from those of healthy subjects in internal modulation as shown by SI. Moreover, AEI is the critical characteristics for verifying subjects with CHF from subjects with AF in a degree of long-term correlation. Both AEI and SI contribute to presenting the characteristic profiles of a human heartbeat time series.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease and sudden cardiac arrest are the leading causes  of death in the United States. Early defibrillation is key to successful resuscitation for patients who experience shockable rhythms during a cardiac arrest. It is therefore vital that the shock advisory of AEDs (automated external defibrillators) or defibrillators in AED mode be reliable and appropriate. The goal of this study was to better understand the performance of multiple lay-rescuer and hospital professional defibrillators in AED mode in their analysis of ventricular arrhythmias. The measurable objectives of this study sought to quantify: 1. No shock advisory for sinus rhythms at any rate. 2. Recognition and shock advisory for ventricular fibrillation (VF). 3. Recognition and shock advisory for monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT). 4. Recognition and shock advisory for Torsades de Pointes (TdP). METHODS: This is a prospective evaluation of two AEDs and four semi-automatic, hospital professional defibrillators. This study represents post-marketing evaluation of FDA approved devices. Each defibrillator was connected to multiple rhythm simulators and presented with simulated ECG waveforms 20 consecutive times at various rates when possible. RESULTS: All four defibrillators and both AEDs tested consistently recognized normal sinus rhythm (NSR) from all rhythm sources, and did not recommend a shock for NSR at any rate (from 80 to 220 bpm). All four defibrillators and both AEDs recognized VF from all rhythm sources tested and recommended a shock 100% of the time. Variations were found in the shock advisory rates among defibrillators when testing simulated VT heart rates at or below 150 bpm. One AED tested did not consistently advise a shock for monomorphic VT or TdP at any tested rate. CONCLUSION: Lay-rescuer AEDs and professional hospital defibrillators tested in AED mode did not reliably recommend a shock for sustained monomorphic VT or TdP at certain rates, despite the fact that it is a critical component of the currently recommended treatment. These findings require further examination of the risk benefit analysis of shocking or not shocking rhythms such as TdP or pulseless VT.

N2  - The sample entropy (SampEn) has been widely used to quantify the complexity of  RR-interval time series. It is a fact that higher complexity, and hence, entropy is associated with the RR-interval time series of healthy subjects. But, SampEn suffers from the disadvantage that it assigns higher entropy to the randomized surrogate time series as well as to certain pathological time series, which is a misleading observation. This wrong estimation of the complexity of a time series may be due to the fact that the existing SampEn technique updates the threshold value as a function of long-term standard deviation (SD) of a time series. However, time series of certain pathologies exhibits substantial variability in beat-to-beat fluctuations. So the SD of the first order difference (short term SD) of the time series should be considered while updating threshold value, to account for period-to-period variations inherited in a time series. In the present work, improved sample entropy (I-SampEn), a new methodology has been proposed in which threshold value is updated by considering the period-to-period variations of a time series. The I-SampEn technique results in assigning higher entropy value to age-matched healthy subjects than patients suffering atrial fibrillation (AF) and diabetes mellitus (DM). Our results are in agreement with the theory of reduction in complexity of RR-interval time series in patients suffering from chronic cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular diseases.

N2  - A non-uniform distribution of diagnostic information in the electrocardiogram (ECG)  has been commonly accepted and is the background to several compression, denoising and watermarking methods. Gaze tracking is a widely recognized method for identification of an observer's preferences and interest areas. The statistics of experts' scanpaths were found to be a convenient quantitative estimate of medical information density for each particular component (i.e., wave) of the ECG record. In this paper we propose the application of generalized perceptual features to control the adaptive sampling of a digital ECG. Firstly, based on temporal distribution of the information density, local ECG bandwidth is estimated and projected to the actual positions of components in heartbeat representation. Next, the local sampling frequency is calculated pointwise and the ECG is adaptively low-pass filtered in all simultaneous channels. Finally, sample values are interpolated at new time positions forming a non-uniform time series. In evaluation of perceptual sampling, an inverse transform was used for the reconstruction of regularly sampled ECG with a percent root-mean-square difference (PRD) error of 3-5% (for compression ratios 3.0-4.7, respectively). Nevertheless, tests performed with the use of the CSE Database show good reproducibility of ECG diagnostic features, within the IEC 60601-2-25:2015 requirements, thanks to the occurrence of distortions in less relevant parts of the cardiac cycle.

N2  - In electrocardiographic (ECG)-gated computed tomography (CT) for diagnosis of  cardiac diseases, radiation dose and image quality are optimized by limiting field of view (FOV) and centering on the heart. However, it is necessary to set wide FOV with large bowtie filter depending on patient positioning or various diagnoses such as aortic diseases. The purpose of this study is to clarify influence of bowtie filter and patient positioning on in-plane dose distribution, organ-absorbed dose, image quality in ECG-gated CT. In-plane dose distribution and organ-absorbed dose were evaluated with radio photoluminescence glass dosimeters, and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) were measured for evaluation of image quality. The bowtie filter was used small (S) and large (L). With automatic exposure control, volume computed tomography dose index was 55.3 mGy at S and 71.8 mGy at L. The phantom was positioned on the heart of phantom (Heart) and the center of phantom (Body). In Heart-L compared with Heart-S, organ-absorbed dose was 1.29 times at breasts. In Heart-S compared with Body-S, in-plane dose distribution was increased 25% at left anterior and decreased 20% at right posterior. In SNR, S and L were decreased from 50 mm off-center. To set appropriate bowtie filter and positioning was reduced radiation dose and improved image quality in ECG-gated CT.

N2  - BACKGROUND: This study investigates the variations of Heart Rate Variability (HRV)  due to a real-life stressor and proposes a classifier based on nonlinear features of HRV for automatic stress detection. METHODS: 42 students volunteered to participate to the study about HRV and stress. For each student, two recordings were performed: one during an on-going university examination, assumed as a real-life stressor, and one after holidays. Nonlinear analysis of HRV was performed by using Poincaré Plot, Approximate Entropy, Correlation dimension, Detrended Fluctuation Analysis, Recurrence Plot. For statistical comparison, we adopted the Wilcoxon Signed Rank test and for development of a classifier we adopted the Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). RESULTS: Almost all HRV features measuring heart rate complexity were significantly decreased in the stress session. LDA generated a simple classifier based on the two Poincaré Plot parameters and Approximate Entropy, which enables stress detection with a total classification accuracy, a sensitivity and a specificity rate of 90%, 86%, and 95% respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the current study suggest that nonlinear HRV analysis using short term ECG recording could be effective in automatically detecting real-life stress condition, such as a university examination.

N2  - ECG anomaly detection is a necessary approach to detect disease Electrocardiography(  ECG) signals before the detail diagnosis process in medical field to gauge the health of the human heart. Nowadays, there are many anomaly detection methods for ECG detection including supervised learning and unsupervised learning. For supervised learning, it requires the knowledge of expert and different types of Arrhythmia data for training. However, since the anomalies are less and unknown in many cases which are di cult to distinguish and be labeled, unsupervised methods are more suitable to detect the ECG anomalies. Furthermore, the existing unsupervised learning studies do not take ECG shape into account where different diseases have different shapes. In this paper, a novel simple trend aggregate approximation method is proposed, the relative binary trend representation are used to record the shape feature in original time series and to detect the anomaly heart signals by similarity comparison. We use the ECG dataset in UCR Time Series Classification Archive to obtain ECG time series data and the experiment results are assessed by means of sensitivity, specificity, false alarm rate measures which is robust and promising with high accuracy.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether correct adherence to clinical guidelines might have  led to prevention of cases with adverse neonatal outcome. DESIGN: Secondary analysis of cases with adverse outcome in a multicenter randomized clinical trial. SETTING: Nine Dutch hospitals. POPULATION: Pregnant women with a term singleton fetus in cephalic position. METHODS: Data were obtained from a randomized trial that compared monitoring by STAN® (index group) with cardiotocography (control group). In both trial arms, three observers independently assessed the fetal surveillance results in all cases with adverse neonatal outcome, to determine whether an indication for intervention was present, based on current clinical guidelines. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Adverse neonatal outcome cases fulfilled one or more of the following criteria: (i) metabolic acidosis in umbilical cord artery (pH < 7.05 and base deficit in extracellular fluid >12 mmol/L); (ii) umbilical cord artery pH < 7.00; (iii) perinatal death; and/or (iv) signs of moderate or severe hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy. RESULTS: We studied 5681 women, of whom 61 (1.1%) had an adverse outcome (26 index; 35 control). In these women, the number of performed operative deliveries for fetal distress was 18 (69.2%) and 16 (45.7%), respectively. Reassessment of all 61 cases showed that there was a fetal indication to intervene in 23 (88.5%) and 19 (57.6%) cases, respectively. In 13 (50.0%) vs. 11 (33.3%) cases, respectively, this indication occurred more than 20 min before the time of delivery, meaning that these adverse outcomes could possibly have been prevented. CONCLUSIONS: In our trial, more strict adherence to clinical guidelines could have led to additional identification and prevention of adverse outcome.

N2  - PURPOSE: Neuromodulation, such as vagal nerve stimulation and intestinal electrical  stimulation, has been introduced for the treatment of obesity and diabetes. Ideally, neuromodulation should be applied automatically after food intake. The purpose of this study was to develop a method of automatic food intake detection through dynamic analysis of heart rate variability (HRV). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two experiments were conducted: (1) a small sample series with a standard test meal and (2) a large sample series with varying meal size. Electrocardiograms (ECGs) were collected in the fasting and postprandial states. Each ECG was processed to compute the HRV. For each HRV segment, time- and frequency-domain features were derived and used as inputs to train and test an artificial neural network (ANN). The ANN was trained and tested with different cross-validation methods. RESULTS: The highest classification accuracy reached with leave-one-subject-out-leave-one-sample-out cross-validation was 0.93 in experiment 1 and 0.88 in experiment 2. Retraining the ANN on recordings of a subject drastically increased the achieved accuracy for that subject to values of 0.995 and 0.95 in experiments 1 and 2, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Automatic food intake detection by ANNs, using features from the HRV, is feasible and may have a great potential for neuromodulation-based treatments of meal-related disorders.

N2  - 1. Within the context of neural regulation of the activity of sinus node pacemaker  cells, the study of heart rate variability, as explored in the frequency domain by spectral analysis, was proposed about 15 years ago as a quantitative tool for the evaluation of short-term autonomic cardiovascular control. It has since been postulated that the two main oscillations observed, one at low and the other at high frequency, may respectively be markers of sympathetic vs. vagal efferent cardiac activity, and that the low- and high-frequency signals may reflect a reciprocal or 'push-pull' relationship between sympathetic and parasympathetic control. 2. In our power spectra assessment, ECG R-R intervals were submitted to fast Fourier transformation analysis in order to study the mechanisms underlying the control of heart beats in rats. Data were acquired in conditions of steady arterial blood pressure and cardiac and respiratory activity (spontaneous or artificially stimulated) in diethyl-ether-anaesthetized and pithed rats, as well as in a group of control rats, all in the presence and absence of l-hyoscyamine. 3. With increasing doses of the parasympathetic antagonist, the fractal dimension of the time-series structure remained stable in most cases. The low-frequency spectral component narrowed with increasing drug doses and the high-frequency band underwent either no, or only very slight, changes. 4. In these rodent assays, the low- and high-frequency signals cannot be interpreted as a push-pull relationship between sympathetic and parasympathetic control.

METHODS: Electrocardiograms were recorded as time series data with a 2 kHz frequency ECG amplifier in 13 patients with ATS1 (positive for KCNJ2 mutation, ATS1 group) and age-matched healthy individuals (control group). Conventional ECG parameters were measured, and principal component analysis (PCA) and independent component analysis (ICA) were applied to the TU wave complex. RESULTS: Time from T peak (Tp) to U peak (Up), time from bottom (B) to Up, and time from B to U end (BUe, U duration) (0.232 ± 0.018 vs. 0.165 ± 0.017, p < .0001), where B is the lowest point between T and U waves, were all longer in the ATS1 group than the control group. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that BUe could completely differentiate the two groups. PCA ratios in the ATS1 group were significantly larger than the control group (26.5 ± 12.3 vs. 10.4 ± 6.2, p = .0005). ICA revealed 1 or 2 U-wave-specific independent components (ICs) that exclusively comprise the U wave in ATS1, whereas U waves in the control group were composed of some ICs that also comprised T waves. CONCLUSIONS: U-wave-related temporal parameters, particularly BUe, and the existence of U-wave-specific ICs, extracted in the ICA, are useful for differentiation of U waves in ATS1 from those in healthy individuals.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Measuring local RV function in adult congenital heart disease (ACHD)  with echocardiography or MRI is challenging because of the complex geometry and existing pacing devices. Visual assessment of ventricular function via low-dose cardiac CT has been recently performed. This pilot study assessed whether low-dose 4D cine CT combined with automatic measurement of regional shortening could quantify right-ventricular function in ACHD patients. METHODS: Seven patients with Tetralogy of Fallot either contraindicated for MRI or assessed for coronary artery disease and seven non-congenital patients were imaged with ECG-gated cardiac CT utilizing a 320-detector row scanner. Right ventricular global function and regional shortening were quantified. RESULTS: Non-congenital patients were imaged with 2.9±2.1mSv and 395±359 HU blood-myocardium contrast. The ACHD patients were imaged with 2.1±1.3mSv and 726±296 HU contrast. Right ventricles of the ACHD patients had higher end-diastolic volume (297±107mL vs 123±34mL, p=0.001), lower ejection fraction (32.0±4.9% vs 45.0±6.0%, p=0.001), and higher dyskinetic fraction (10.9±3.7% vs 2.6±2.8%, p<0.001) relative to the non-congenital controls. CONCLUSIONS: In this initial pilot study, right ventricular global and regional systolic function were measured using low-dose cine CT with SQUEEZ quantification in non-congenital patients as well as ACHD patients with Tetralogy of Fallot. Unique regional features of RV dyskinesia were identified in the ACHD patients which could yield a more precise quantification of RV function.

N2  - Background: We recently introduced the concept of heart rate fragmentation along  with a set of metrics for its quantification. The term was coined to refer to an increase in the percentage of changes in heart rate acceleration sign, a dynamical marker of a type of anomalous variability. The effort was motivated by the observation that fragmentation, which is consistent with the breakdown of the neuroautonomic-electrophysiologic control system of the sino-atrial node, could confound traditional short-term analysis of heart rate variability. Objective: The objectives of this study were to: (1) introduce a symbolic dynamical approach to the problem of quantifying heart rate fragmentation; (2) evaluate how the distribution of the different dynamical patterns ("words") varied with the participants' age in a group of healthy subjects and patients with coronary artery disease (CAD); and (3) quantify the differences in the fragmentation patterns between the two sample populations. Methods: The symbolic dynamical method employed here was based on a ternary map of the increment NN interval time series and on the analysis of the relative frequency of symbolic sequences (words) with a pre-defined set of features. We analyzed annotated, open-access Holter databases of healthy subjects and patients with CAD, provided by the University of Rochester Telemetric and Holter ECG Warehouse (THEW). Results: The degree of fragmentation was significantly higher in older individuals than in their younger counterparts. However, the fragmentation patterns were different in the two sample populations. In healthy subjects, older age was significantly associated with a higher percentage of transitions from acceleration/deceleration to zero acceleration and vice versa (termed "soft" inflection points). In patients with CAD, older age was also significantly associated with higher percentages of frank reversals in heart rate acceleration (transitions from acceleration to deceleration and vice versa, termed "hard" inflection points). Compared to healthy subjects, patients with CAD had significantly higher percentages of soft and hard inflection points, an increased percentage of words with a high degree of fragmentation and a decreased percentage of words with a lower degree of fragmentation. Conclusion: The symbolic dynamical method employed here was useful to probe the newly recognized property of heart rate fragmentation. The findings from these cross-sectional studies confirm that CAD and older age are associated with higher levels of heart rate fragmentation. Furthermore, fragmentation with healthy aging appears to be phenotypically different from fragmentation in the context of CAD.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Automated detection of return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) is still  an unsolved problem during cardiac arrest. Current guidelines recommend the use of capnography, but most automatic methods are based on the analysis of the ECG and thoracic impedance (TI) signals. This study analysed the added value of EtCO(2) for discriminating pulsed (PR) and pulseless (PEA) rhythms and its potential to detect ROSC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 426 out-of-hospital cardiac arrest cases, 117 with ROSC and 309 without ROSC, were analysed. First, EtCO(2) values were compared for ROSC and no ROSC cases. Second, 5098 artefact free 3-s long segments were automatically extracted and labelled as PR (3639) or PEA (1459) using the instant of ROSC annotated by the clinician on scene as gold standard. Machine learning classifiers were designed using features obtained from the ECG, TI and the EtCO(2) value. Third, the cases were retrospectively analysed using the classifier to discriminate cases with and without ROSC. RESULTS: EtCO(2) values increased significantly from 41 mmHg 3-min before ROSC to 57 mmHg 1-min after ROSC, and EtCO(2) was significantly larger for PR than for PEA, 46 mmHg/20 mmHg (p < 0.05). Adding EtCO(2) to the machine learning models increased their area under the curve (AUC) by over 2 percentage points. The combination of ECG, TI and EtCO(2) had an AUC for the detection of pulse of 0.92. Finally, the retrospective analysis showed a sensitivity and specificity of 96.6% and 94.5% for the detection of ROSC and no-ROSC cases, respectively. CONCLUSION: Adding EtCO(2) improves the performance of automatic algorithms for pulse detection based on ECG and TI. These algorithms can be used to identify pulse on site, and to retrospectively identify cases with ROSC.

N2  - Objective Detecting paroxysmal atrial fibrillation in patients with ischemic stroke  presenting in sinus rhythm is difficult because such episodes are often short, and they are also frequently asymptomatic. It is possible that the ventricular repolarization dynamics may reflect atrial vulnerability and cardioembolic stroke. Hence, we compared the QT-RR relation between cardioembolic stroke and atherosclerotic stroke during sinus rhythm. Methods The subjects comprised 62 consecutive ischemic stroke patients including 31 with cardioembolic strokes (71.8±12.7 years, 17 men) and 31 with atherosclerotic strokes (74.8±10.8 years, 23 men). The QT and RR intervals were measured from ECG waves based on a 15-sec averaged ECG during 24-hour Holter recording using an automatic QT analyzing system. The QT interval dependence on the RR interval was analyzed using a linear regression line for each subject ([QT]=A[RR]+B; where A is the slope and B is the y-intercept). Results The mean slope of the QT-RR relation was significantly greater in cardioembolic stroke than in atherosclerotic stroke (0.187±0.044 vs. 0.142±0.045, p<0.001). The mean QT, RR, or QTc during 24-hour Holter recordings did not differ between them. An increased slope (≥0.14) of the QT-RR regression line could predict cardioembolic stroke with 97% sensitivity, 55% specificity and a positive predictive value of 64%. Conclusion The increased slope of the QT-RR linear regression line based on 24-hour Holter ECG in patients with ischemic stroke presenting in sinus rhythm may therefore be a simple and useful marker for cardioembolic stroke.

N2  - The left ventricular pressure (LVP) and ECG signals that appear during and after  ischaemia tend to be very irregular (fibrillation, arrhythmia). Computer based data acquisition system, that we developed to support experiments on isolated Langendorff's rat heart, enabled the usage of methods derived from non-linear dynamics. To classify the irregularity of heart action, ECG and LVP time series have been used to calculate correlation dimension (D2) and largest Lyapunov exponent. We compared the results of signals derived from isolated heart at standard conditions and hearts rendered ischaemic for 60 minutes. Our results show that the level of irregularity can be classified efficiently using the quoted approach.

N2  - This paper proposes the use of dynamic warping (DW) methods for improving automatic  sleep and wake classification using actigraphy and respiratory effort. DW is an algorithm that finds an optimal nonlinear alignment between two series allowing scaling and shifting. It is widely used to quantify (dis)similarity between two series. To compare the respiratory effort between sleep and wake states by means of (dis)similarity, we constructed two novel features based on DW. For a given epoch of a respiratory effort recording, the features search for the optimally aligned epoch within the same recording in time and frequency domain. This is expected to yield a high (or low) similarity score when this epoch is sleep (or wake). Since the comparison occurs throughout the entire-night recording of a subject, it may reduce the effects of within- and between-subject variations of the respiratory effort, and thus help discriminate between sleep and wake states. The DW-based features were evaluated using a linear discriminant classifier on a dataset of 15 healthy subjects. Results show that the DW-based features can provide a Cohen's Kappa coefficient of agreement κ = 0.59 which is significantly higher than the existing respiratory-based features and is comparable to actigraphy. After combining the actigraphy and the DW-based features, the classifier achieved a κ of 0.66 and an overall accuracy of 95.7%, outperforming an earlier actigraphy- and respiratory-based feature set ( κ = 0.62). The results are also comparable with those obtained using an actigraphy- and cardiorespiratory-based feature set but have the important advantage that they do not require an ECG signal to be recorded.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Electrocardiogram (ECG) telemonitoring is one of the most promising  applications of medical telemetry. However, previous approaches to ECG telemonitoring have largely relied on public databases of ECG results. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this article we propose a smart ECG system called Pit-a-Pat, which extracts features from ECG signals and detects arrhythmia. It is designed to run on an Android™ (Google, Mountain View, CA) device, without requiring modifications to other software. RESULTS: We implemented the Pit-a-Pat system using a commercial ECG device, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of Pit-a-Pat for monitoring the ECG signal and analyzing the cardiac activity of a mobile patient. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed system allows monitoring of cardiac activity with automatic analysis, thereby providing a convenient, inexpensive, and ubiquitous adjunct to personal healthcare.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: Birth asphyxia is a condition where a fetus suffers from lack of oxygen  during birth. Intervention by manual ventilation should start within one minute after birth. Bag-mask resuscitators are commonly used in situations where ventilation is provided by a single health care worker. Due to a high complexity of interactions between physiological conditions of the newborns and the clinical treatment, the recommendations for bag-mask ventilation of infants remains controversial. The purpose of this paper is to illustrate the processing and parameterization of ventilation signals recorded from the Laerdal newborn resuscitation monitor into meaningful data. METHODS: Basic signal processing approaches are applied on various signal channels (airway pressure, flow, CO (2), and ECG) to detect events related to ventilation activities. RESULTS: Different types of events are detected and parameterized to describe the characteristics of ventilation procedure. CONCLUSIONS: Efficient detection algorithms as well as parameterization of ventilation events could be useful for retrospective analysis of resuscitation data, for example, by finding the association between different ventilation parameters and positive responses of newborns. SIGNIFICANCE: Information about ventilation events and ventilation parameters could potentially be useful during a resuscitation situation by giving immediate feedback to the health care provider.

N2  - This paper reviews those inverse electrocardiographic solutions that compute the  electrical activity of the heart in terms of equivalent sources such as multipoles or multiple dipoles, as opposed to more realistic source formulations such as epicardial potentials. It treats, in succession, inverse solutions in terms of a single fixed-location dipole, a multipole series, moving dipoles, and, finally, multiple fixed-location dipoles. For each category of solution, simulation studies, animal experiments, and work involving human subjects are reviewed. Finally, more recent work that seeks to compute the cardiac activation isochrones, from the time integrals of the torso potentials during the QRS complex of the electrocardiogram, is described. The paper concludes with a discussion on the future of inverse electrocardiographic solutions in terms of equivalent sources.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Noninvasive fetal electrocardiography (fECG), obtained positioning  electrodes on the maternal abdomen, is important in safeguarding the life and the health of the unborn child. This study aims to provide a review of the state of the art of fECG, and includes a description of the parameters useful for fetus clinical evaluation; of the fECG recording procedures; and of the techniques to extract the fECG signal from the abdominal recordings. METHODS: The fetus clinical status is inferred by analyzing growth parameters, supraventricular arrhythmias, ST-segment variability, and fetal-movement parameters from the fECG signal. This can be extracted from an abdominal recording obtained using one of the following two electrode-types configurations: pure-abdominal and mixed. Differently from the former, the latter also provides pure maternal ECG tracings. From a mathematical point of view, the abdominal recording is a summation of three signal components: the fECG signal (i.e., the signal of interest to be extracted), the abdominal maternal ECG (amECG), and the noise. Automatic extraction of fECG includes noise removal by abdominal signal prefiltration (0.5-45 Hz bandpass filter) and amECG cancellation. CONCLUSIONS: Differences among methods rely on different techniques used to extract fECG. If pure abdominal electrode configurations are used, fECG is extracted directly from the abdominal recording using independent component analysis or template subtraction. Eventually, if mixed electrode configurations are used, the fECG can be extracted using the adaptive filtering fed with the maternal ECG recorded by the electrodes located in the woman thorax or shoulder.

N2  - PURPOSE: This study was conducted to test, in mountain running route conditions, the  accuracy of the Polar V800™ monitor as a suitable device for monitoring the heart rate variability (HRV) of runners. METHOD: Eighteen healthy subjects ran a route that included a range of running slopes such as those encountered in trail and ultra-trail races. The comparative study of a V800 and a Holter SEER 12 ECG Recorder™ included the analysis of RR time series and short-term HRV analysis. A correction algorithm was designed to obtain the corrected Polar RR intervals. Six 5-min segments related to different running slopes were considered for each subject. RESULTS: The correlation between corrected V800 RR intervals and Holter RR intervals was very high (r = 0.99, p < 0.001), and the bias was less than 1 ms. The limits of agreement (LoA) obtained for SDNN and RMSSD were (- 0.25 to 0.32 ms) and (- 0.90 to 1.08 ms), respectively. The effect size (ES) obtained in the time domain HRV parameters was considered small (ES < 0.2). Frequency domain HRV parameters did not differ (p > 0.05) and were well correlated (r ≥ 0.96, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Narrow limits of agreement, high correlations and small effect size suggest that the Polar V800 is a valid tool for the analysis of heart rate variability in athletes while running high endurance events such as marathon, trail, and ultra-trail races.

N2  - On the basis of Discrete Hilbert Transformation spectral parameters for dynamic EMG  analysis can be introduced. Within analysis intervals which are used in the same manner as in spectral analysis, the momentary power of EMG frequency bands can be computed as time series of the same interval duration. A close connection exists between momentary power and the current phenomenology of power spectral analysis because the momentary power of a defined frequency band can be seen as the exact dynamic equivalent of the corresponding mean power value deduced from the power spectrum. A multichannel EMG recording (greater than or equal to 16 channels) makes the representation of the topographical distribution of the spectral parameter by a coloured map possible. Additionally, the momentary power can be used to calculate map sequences. In this way, changes of EMG activity can be quantified by map sequences of an arbitrary time resolution. By calculation of momentary frequency via DHT an artefact detection scheme for ECG interference can be suggested. A completion of this methodology can be carried out by applications of adaptive filtration procedures. Using this concept of EMG processing, a new and common methodical basis of EMG power spectral analysis can be introduced.

N2  - PURPOSE: The aim of the study was to evaluate the feasibility of continuous heart  and respiratory rate variability (HRV and RRV, respectively) monitoring in critically ill patients derived from electrocardiogram (ECG) and end-tidal capnography (etCO(2)) waveforms. METHODS: Thirty-four patients (age, 56.5 ± 15.9 years; Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score, 22.8 ± 6.7) underwent continuous recording of ECG and etCO(2) waveforms from intensive care unit admission and intubation to discharge or maximum of 14 days. Overlapping 5-minute windows were analyzed with a wide range of variability measures (time, frequency, entropy, and scale-invariant and nonlinear domains). Waveform data quality, presence of disconnections and arrhythmias, quality of beat and breath detection, and subsequent variability computations were evaluated. RESULTS: Patients were enrolled for 11.0 ± 3.6 days. The proportion of missing waveform data among all patients was (median [interquartile range, maximum]) 2.9% (1.3%-9.7%, 36.4%) for ECG and 3.1% (1.1%-11.4%, 84.5%) for etCO(2). Heart rate variability data loss (ie, proportion of windows removed) was 1.3% (1.0%-2.1%, 5.9%) due to disconnection, 0.6% (0.1%-3.9%, 39.5%) due to atrial fibrillation, and 6.6% (1.4%-17.9%, 89.0%) due to data cleaning. Respiratory rate variability data loss was 7.3% (2.9%-11.6%, 47.7%) due to disconnection (or apnea) and 5.5% (2.9%-8.4%, 56.4%) due to cleaning. Continuous individualized multiorgan variability analysis processing resulted in HRV and RRV computations for 81.2% ± 25.0% and 87.5% ± 11.9% of available ECG and etCO(2) waveform data, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The quality of continuously recorded ECG and etCO(2) waveforms in critically ill patients is adequate for subsequent continuous variability monitoring in this pilot study. The clinical utility of continuous variability analysis merits further investigation.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Pre-procedural TAVI planning requires highly sophisticated and  time-consuming manual measurements performed by experienced readers. Semi-automatic software may assist with partial automation of assessment of multiple parameters. The aim of this study was to evaluate differences between manual and semi-automatic measurements in terms of agreement and time. METHODS: One hundred and twenty TAVI candidates referred for the retrospectively ECG-gated CTA (2nd and 3rd generation dual source CT) were evaluated. Fully manual and semi-automatic measurements of fourteen aortic root parameters were assessed in the 20% phase of the R-R interval. Reading time was compared using paired samples t-test. Inter-software agreement was calculated using the Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) in a 2-way mixed effects model. Differences between manual and semi-automatic measurements were evaluated using Bland-Altman analysis. RESULTS: The time needed for evaluation using semi-automatic assessment (3 min 24 s ± 1 min 7 s) was significantly lower (p<0.001) compared to a fully manual approach (6 min 31 sec ± 1 min 1 sec). Excellent inter-software agreement was found (ICC = 0.93 ± 0.0; range:0.90-0.95). The same prosthesis size from manual and semi-automatic measurements was selected in 92% of cases, when sizing was based on annular area. Prosthesis sizing based on annular short diameter and perimeter agreed in 99% and 96% cases, respectively. CONCLUSION: Use of semi-automatic software in pre-TAVI evaluation results in comparable results in respect of measurements and selected valve prosthesis size, while necessary reading time is significantly lower.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Road Traffic Accidents (RTA) are most probably the leading cause of post  traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in developed countries. The autonomic nervous system (ANS) disturbances, due to psychological trauma, are part of the pathophysiology of PTSD. The aim of the present study was to determine whether early heart rate variability (HRV) measurement, a biomarker of the ANS function, could act as a predictor of PTSD development after a RTA. METHODS: We prospectively investigated 35 survivors of RTA with both physical injury and psychological trauma. HRV data were obtained from 24-h Holter ECG monitoring, which was performed on the second day after the accident. Time domain analysis was applied to the inter-beat (RR) interval time series to calculate the various parameters of HRV. PTSD status was assessed 2 and 6 months after RTA. RESULTS: There was a global diminution of HRV measurements in the PTSD group at both 2 and 6 months. The variability index was the best predictor of PTSD with the area under the receiveroperating curve for discriminating PTSD at 6 months at 0.92 (95% CI: 0.785; 1.046). A cut-off at 2.19% yielded a sensitivity of 85.7% and a specificity of 81.8% for PTSD. Positive and negative predictive values were respectively 75% and 90%. However, initial heart rate (HR) data were relevant at 2 months but not at 6 months. CONCLUSION: RTA survivors exhibiting lower parasympathetic modulation of HR, indexed by temporal analysis of HRV, are more susceptible to developing PTSD as a short and long-term outcome.

N2  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Automatic electrocardiogram (ECG) heartbeat  classification is substantial for diagnosing heart failure. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the effect of machine learning methods in creating the model which classifies normal and congestive heart failure (CHF) on the long-term ECG time series. METHODS: The study was performed in two phases: feature extraction and classification phase. In feature extraction phase, autoregressive (AR) Burg method is applied for extracting features. In classification phase, five different classifiers are examined namely, C4.5 decision tree, k-nearest neighbor, support vector machine, artificial neural networks and random forest classifier. The ECG signals were acquired from BIDMC Congestive Heart Failure and PTB Diagnostic ECG databases and classified by applying various experiments. RESULTS: The experimental results are evaluated in several statistical measures (sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, F-measure and ROC curve) and showed that the random forest method gives 100% classification accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: Impressive performance of random forest method proves that it plays significant role in detecting congestive heart failure (CHF) and can be valuable in expressing knowledge useful in medicine.

N2  - Automatic detection and classification of life-threatening arrhythmia plays an  important part in dealing with various cardiac conditions. In this paper, a novel method for classification of various types of arrhythmia using morphological and dynamic features is presented. Discrete wavelet transform (DWT) is applied on each heart beat to obtain the morphological features. It provides better time and frequency resolution of the electrocardiogram (ECG) signal, which helps in decoding important information of a quasiperiodic ECG using variable window sizes. RR interval information is used as a dynamic feature. The nonlinear dynamics of RR interval are captured using Teager energy operator, which improves the arrhythmia classification. Moreover, to remove redundancy, DWT subbands are subjected to dimensionality reduction using independent component analysis, and a total of twelve coefficients are selected as morphological features. These hybrid features are combined and fed to a neural network to classify arrhythmia. The proposed algorithm has been tested over MIT-BIH arrhythmia database using 13724 beats and MIT-BIH supraventricular arrhythmia database using 22151 beats. The proposed methodology resulted in an improved average accuracy of 99.75% and 99.84% for class- and subject-oriented scheme, respectively, using three-fold cross validation.

N2  - Malignant arrhythmia can lead to sudden cardiac death (SCD). Shockable arrhythmia  can be terminated with device electrical shock therapies. Ventricular-tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation (VF) are responsive to electrical anti-tachycardia pacing therapy and defibrillation which help to restore normal electrical and mechanical function of the heart. In contrast, non-shockable arrhythmia like asystole and bradycardia are not responsive to electric shock therapy. Distinguishing between shockable and non-shockable arrhythmia is an important diagnostic challenge that has practical clinical relevance. It is difficult to accurately differentiate between these two types of arrhythmia by manual inspection of electrocardiogram (ECG) segments within the short time duration before triggering the device for electrical therapy. Automated defibrillators are equipped with automatic shockable arrhythmia detection algorithms based on ECG morphological features, which may possess variable diagnostic performance depending on machine models. In our work, we have designed a robust system using wavelet decomposition filter banks for extraction of features from the ECG signal and then classifying the features. We believe this method will improve the accuracy of discriminating between shockable and non-shockable arrhythmia compared with existing conventional algorithms. We used a novel three channel orthogonal wavelet filter bank, which extracted features from ECG epochs of duration 2 s to distinguish between shockable and non-shockable arrhythmia. The fuzzy, Renyi and sample entropies are extracted from the various wavelet coefficients and fed to support vector machine (SVM) classifier for automated classification. We have obtained an accuracy of 98.9%, sensitivity and specificity of 99.08% and 97.11.9%, respectively, using 10-fold cross validation. The area under the receiver operating characteristic has been found to be 0.99 with F1-score of 0.994. The system developed is more accurate than the existing algorithms. Hence, the proposed system can be employed in automated defibrillators inside and outside hospitals for emergency revival of patients suffering from SCD. These automated defibrillators can also be implanted inside the human body for automatic detection of potentially fatal shockable arrhythmia and to deliver an appropriate electric shock to the heart.

N2  - PURPOSE: To investigate the dose reduction potential of low kV triple-rule-out  dual-source CT angiography (TRO-CTA) in non-obese (BMI ≤ 25 kg/m(2)) patients with acute chest pain. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty consecutive patients were randomly assigned to two different retrospectively ECG-gated TRO-CTA protocols in this prospective trial: Thirty patients were examined with a 120-kV standard protocol (320 reference mAs with automatic tube current modulation, automatically adapted pitch and ECG-pulsing) and served as the control group (group 1), an otherwise identical 100 kV protocol was used in the other thirty patients (group 2) for a radiation dose reduction. Subjective image quality was assessed on a 5 point scale (1: excellent, 5: non-diagnostic) by two blinded observers. Quantitative image analysis assessed vascular attenuation, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) in different vascular segments. The effective dose was calculated from the dose length product (DLP) using a conversion coefficient of 0.017 mSvmGy(-1)cm(-1). RESULTS: There was no significant difference of age, BMI, heart rate, pitch or scan length between both patient groups. Subjective image quality was rated similar in both groups (group 1: 1.2 ± 0.4, group 2: average score=1.3 ± 0.5). Vessel attenuation was significantly higher in group 2 than in group 1 (ascending aorta: 456 ± 83 HU vs. 370 ± 78 HU, p<0.001; pulmonary artery: 468 ± 118 HU vs. 411 ± 91 HU, p=0.03; left coronary artery: 437 ± 110 HU vs. 348 ± 89 HU, p<0.001), however, there was no significant difference in SNR (13.2 ± 7.6 vs. 14.5 ± 7.5, p=0.49) or CNR (13.8 ± 6.6 vs. 15.9 ± 7.7, p=0.25). The effective radiation dose of the 100 kV protocol was significantly lower (9.6 ± 3.2 mSv vs. 18.1 ± 9.4 mSv, p<0.0001). CONCLUSION: TRO-CTA with 100 kV is feasible in non-obese patients and results in diagnostic image quality and significantly reduced radiation dose.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To test the potential value of more frequent QT interval measurement in  hospitalized patients. DESIGN: We performed a prospective, observational study. SETTING: All adult intensive care unit and progressive care unit beds of a university medical center. PATIENTS: All patients admitted to one of six critical care units over a 2-month period were included in analyses. INTERVENTIONS: All critical care beds (n = 154) were upgraded to a continuous QT monitoring system (Philips Healthcare). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: QT data were extracted from the bedside monitors for offline analysis. A corrected QT interval >500 msecs was considered prolonged. Episodes of QT prolongation were manually over-read. Electrocardiogram data (67,648 hrs, mean 65 hrs/patient) were obtained. QT prolongation was present in 24%. There were 16 cardiac arrests, with one resulting from Torsade de Pointes (6%). Predictors of QT prolongation were female sex, QT-prolonging drugs, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, hyperglycemia, high creatinine, history of stroke, and hypothyroidism. Patients with QT prolongation had longer hospitalization (276 hrs vs. 132 hrs, p < .0005) and had three times the odds for all-cause in-hospital mortality compared to patients without QT prolongation (odds ratio 2.99 95% confidence interval 1.1-8.1). CONCLUSIONS: We find QT prolongation to be common (24%), with Torsade de Pointes representing 6% of in-hospital cardiac arrests. Predictors of QT prolongation in the acutely ill population are similar to those previously identified in ambulatory populations. Acutely ill patients with QT prolongation have longer lengths of hospitalization and nearly three times the odds for mortality then those without QT prolongation.

N2  - In this study, we defined a new parameter, referred to as the cardiac stress index  (CSI), using a nonlinear detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) of heart rate (HR). Our study aimed to incorporate the CSI into a cycling based fatigue monitoring system developed in our previous work so the muscle fatigue and cardiac stress can be both continuously and quantitatively assessed for subjects undergoing the cycling exercise. By collecting electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, the DFA scaling exponent α was evaluated on the RR time series extracted from a windowed ECG segment. We then obtained the running estimate of α by shifting a one-minute window by a step of 20 seconds so the CSI, defined as the percentage of all the less-than-one α values, can be synchronously updated every 20 seconds. Since the rating of perceived exertion (RPE) scale is considered as a convenient index which is commonly used to monitor subjective perceived exercise intensity, we then related the Borg RPE scale value to the CSI in order to investigate and quantitatively characterize the relationship between exercise-induced fatigue and cardiac stress. Twenty-two young healthy participants were recruited in our study. Each participant was asked to maintain a fixed pedaling speed at a constant load during the cycling exercise. Experimental results showed that a decrease in DFA scaling exponent α or an increase in CSI was observed during the exercise. In addition, the Borg RPE scale and CSI were positively correlated, suggesting that the factors due to cardiac stress might also contribute to fatigue state during physical exercise. Since the CSI can effectively quantify the cardiac stress status during physical exercise, our system may be used in sports medicine, or used by cardiologists who carried out stress tests for monitoring heart condition in patients with heart diseases.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: The prevalence of atrial fibrillation (AF) in the general population is  0.5%-1%. As AF is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia that is associated with an increased morbidity and mortality, its timely diagnosis is clinically desirable. The main aim of this study as our contribution to the PhysioNet/CinC Challenge 2017 was to develop an automatic algorithm for classification of normal sinus rhythm (NSR), AF, other rhythm (O), and noise using a short single-channel ECG. Furthermore, the impact of changing labels/annotations on performance of the proposed algorithm was studied in this article. APPROACH: The challenge training dataset (8528 ECG recordings) and a complementary dataset (6312 ECG recordings) from other sources were used for algorithm development. Version 3 (v3), which is an updated version of the annotations at the official phase of the challenge (v2), was used in this study. In the proposed algorithm, densely connected convolutional networks were combined with feature-based post-processing after initial signal quality analysis for the classification of ECG recordings. MAIN RESULTS: The F1 scores for classification of NSR, AF, and O were 0.91, 0.83, and 0.72, respectively, which led to a F1 of 0.82. There was a small or no performance difference between the top entries in the official phase of the challenge and our proposed method. An increase of 2.5% in F1 score was observed when the same annotations for training and test was used (using v3 annotations) compared to using different annotations (v2 annotations for training and v3 annotations for the test). SIGNIFICANCE: Our promising results suggest that the availability of more data with improved labeling along with improvement in signal quality analysis make our algorithm suitable for practical clinical applications.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of circadian  behavior of blood pressure, left ventricular hypertrophy, and autonomic function on QTc interval duration in untreated hypertensive patients. DESIGN: Hypertensive patients underwent simultaneous blood pressure and ECG 24-h ambulatory monitoring. Patients were classified into two groups on the basis of a lack of nocturnal fall in blood pressure, as dippers and nondippers. A group of normotensive healthy subjects was studied as controls. METHODS: QT and QTc intervals were automatically computed and spectral analysis was applied to RR interval time series from the same electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings. Left ventricular mass index (LVMI) was computed by echocardiogram. RESULTS: No difference among the three groups was found concerning mean values and circadian pattern of heart rate; by contrast, QTc was significantly longer in nondippers compared to dippers or to normotensive subjects, particularly at night-time, whereas all groups exhibited similar circadian variations in heart rate. Compared to dippers, nondippers showed significantly higher LVMI, which positively correlated with QTc, and parasympathetic withdrawal, which negatively correlated with QTc. CONCLUSIONS: Nondippers show a prolonged ventricular repolarization throughout the 24-h period, absent either in dippers or normotensives. The association of left ventricular hypertrophy and vagal deactivation may lead to prolongation of QTc, potentially facilitating ventricular arrhythmias in nondipper hypertensive patients.

N2  - Automatic diagnosis of cardiac events is a current problem of interest in which deep  learning has shown promising success. We have earlier reported the use of Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks-trained on normal ECG patterns-to the detection of anomalies from the prediction errors for real-time diagnostic applications. In this work, we extend our anomaly detection algorithm by introducing a second stage predictor that can identify the actual anomaly class from the error outputs of the first stage model. Results from seven types of anomalies have been presented including Atrial Premature Contraction (APC), Paced Beat (PB), Premature Ventricular Contraction (PVC), Right Bundle Branch Block (RBBB), Ventricular Bigeminy (VB), Ventricular Couplets (VCs) and Ventricular Tachycardia (VT). To optimize anomaly class prediction performance, multiple choices of second stage models such as multilayer perceptron (MLP), support vector machine (SVM) and logistic regression have been employed. A featurization scheme for LSTM prediction errors in the form of overall summaries has been proposed and a successful predictor for the same was developed with good performance. Our results indicate that the error vectors represented by their summary features carry useful predictive information about actual ECG anomaly type. We discuss how the accuracy scores without attention to inherent class imbalances and paucity of data instances may produce misleading performance estimates and hence accurate background models are needed to estimate true predictive performance of multi-class predictors such as those presented in this work. The training data sets and related resources for this study are provided at http://ecg.sciwhylab.org.

N2  - AIMS: High quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) plays an important role in  survival of out-of-hospital cardiac arrests (OHCAs). We have developed an algorithm to automatically identify the quality of chest compressions from data retrieved from automatic external defibrillators (AEDs). METHODS: Electrocardiographic (ECG) signals retrieved from AEDs were analyzed by a newly developed algorithm to identify fluctuations in CPR. The algorithm contained three steps. First, it decomposed the AED signals into several intrinsic mode fluctuations (IMFs) by empirical mode decomposition (EMD). Second, it identified the dominant IMFs that carried the chest compression signals and weighted the IMFs to both enhance the chest compression oscillations and filter the noise. Third, it calculated the autocorrelation function (ACF) of the reconstructed signals and tested their periodicity. Using this algorithm, several CPR quality indicators were automatically calculated minute-by-minute and compared with those derived by audio and visual review of AED data by experienced physicians. RESULTS: A total of 77 (29 women, 48 men) OHCA patients were enrolled, and 351 one-min segments were analyzed. The results showed that the CPR quality parameters calculated from the algorithm were highly correlated with those from the manual review (all P<0.001). The limits of agreement by Bland-Altman analysis were acceptable for chest compression number, total flow time, and no flow time, but not for CPR rate. We also demonstrated that only 41.8±29.8% of time was spent in chest compressions and only 7.5±16.8% was spent in adequate chest compressions. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated that several indicators of CPR quality can be precisely and automatically determined by analyzing the ECG signals from AEDs using EMD and autocorrelograms.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: The goal of this study was to evaluate the impact of the STAT-MI  (ST-Segment Analysis Using Wireless Technology in Acute Myocardial Infarction) network on outcomes in the treatment of patients presenting with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). BACKGROUND: Shortening door-to-balloon (D2B) time remains a national priority for the treatment of STEMI. We previously reported a fully automated wireless network (STAT-MI) for transmission of electrocardiograms (ECGs) for suspected STEMI from the field to offsite cardiologists, allowing early triage with shortening of subsequent D2B times. We now report the impact of the STAT-MI wireless network on infarct size, length of hospital stay (LOS), and mortality. METHODS: A fully automated wireless network (STAT-MI) was developed to enable automatic 12-lead ECG transmission and direct communication between emergency medical services personnel and offsite cardiologists that facilitated direct triage of patients to the cardiac catheterization laboratory. Demographic, laboratory, and time interval data of STAT-MI network patients were prospectively collected over a 33-month period and compared with concurrent control patients who presented with STEMI through non-STAT-MI pathways. RESULTS: From June 2006 through February 2009, 92 patients presented via the STAT-MI network, and 50 patients presented through non-STAT-MI pathways (control group). Baseline clinical and demographic variables were similar in both groups. Overall, compared with control subjects, STAT-MI patients had significantly shorter D2B times (63 [42 to 87] min vs. 119 [96 to 178] min, U = 779.5, p < 0.00004), significantly lower peak troponin I (39.5 [11 to 120.5] ng/ml vs. 87.6 [38.4 to 227] ng/ml, U = 889.5, p = 0.005) and creatine phosphokinase-MB (126.1 [37.2 to 280.5] ng/ml vs. 290.3 [102.4 to 484] ng/ml, U = 883, p = 0.001), higher left ventricular ejection fractions (50% [35 to 55] vs. 35% [25 to 52], U = 1,075, p = 0.004), and shorter LOS (3 [2 to 4] days vs. 5.5 [3.5 to 10.5] days, U = 378, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: A fully automated, field-based, wireless network that transmits ECGs automatically to offsite cardiologists for the early evaluation and triage of patients with STEMI shortens D2B times, reduces infarct size, limits ejection fraction reduction, and shortens LOS.

N2  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the utility of using continuous  heart rate variability (HRV) and respiratory rate variability (RRV) monitoring for (a) tracking daily organ dysfunction in critically ill patients and (b) identifying patterns of variability changes during onset of shock and resolution of respiratory failure. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-three critically ill patients experiencing respiratory and/or cardiac failure underwent continuous recording of their electrocardiogram and capnogram (CO2) waveforms from admission or intubation until discharge (maximum 14 days). HRV and RRV were computed in 5-minute overlapping windows, using Continuous Individualized Multi-organ Variability Analysis software. Multiple organ dysfunction scores were recorded daily. HRV and RRV trajectories were characterized during onset of shock and resolution of respiratory failure. RESULTS: Both HRV and RRV decreased with increasing severity of multiple organ dysfunction scores for a variety of variability metrics. A decline in several measures of HRV and no decline in RRV were observed before onset of shock (n=6). In contrast, during resolution of respiratory failure, an increase in RRV was observed in patients who successfully passed extubation (n=12), with no change in RRV in those who subsequently failed extubation (n=2). CONCLUSIONS: There is an association between reduced HRV and RRV and increasing organ dysfunction in critically ill patients. The significance of observing trends of decreasing HRV (with onset of shock) and increasing RRV (with resolution of respiratory failure) merits further investigation.

N2  - Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a prevalent sleep disorder and highly affects the  quality of human life. Currently, gold standard for OSA detection is polysomnogram. Since this method is time consuming and cost inefficient, practical systems focus on the usage of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals for OSA detection. In this paper, a novel automatic OSA detection method using a single-lead ECG signal has been proposed. A nonlinear feature extraction using wavelet transform (WT) coefficients obtained by an ECG signal decomposition is employed. In addition, different classification methods are investigated. ECG signals are decomposed into eight levels using a Symlet function as a mother Wavelet function with third order. Then, the entropy-based features including fuzzy/approximate/sample/correct conditional entropy as well as other nonlinear features including interquartile range, mean absolute deviation, variance, Poincare plot, and recurrence plot are extracted from WT coefficients. The best features are chosen using the automatic sequential forward feature selection algorithm. In order to assess the introduced method, 95 single-lead ECG recordings are used. The support vector machine classifier having a radial basis function kernel leads to an accuracy of 94.63% (sensitivity: 94.43% and specificity: 94.77%) and 95.71% (sensitivity: 95.83% and specificity: 95.66%) for minute-by-minute and subject-by-subject classifications, respectively. The results show that applying entropy-based features for extracting hidden information of the ECG signals outperforms other available automatic OSA detection methods. The results indicate that a highly accurate OSA detection is attained by just exploiting the single-lead ECG signals. Furthermore, due to the low computational load in the proposed method, it can easily be applied to the home monitoring systems.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the specificity of the electrocardiographic diagnosis of  ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction in the critical care unit setting. DESIGN: Retrospective observational cohort analysis. SETTING: An 880-bed tertiary care teaching hospital with 120 intensive care unit beds. PATIENTS: The population included medical, surgical, trauma, and neurosurgical intensive care unit patients. INTERVENTIONS: Electrocardiograms were systematically collected to include all consecutive recordings over a 15-month period in which the interpretation software indicated ***ACUTE MI***. Patient demographics, markers of intensive care unit complexity, and hospital mortality were ascertained. The electrocardiograms were then further evaluated by a blinded, board-certified cardiologist for agreement or disagreement with the interpretation software. Serum troponin measurements obtained within 96 hrs of electrocardiogram acquisition were used to determine the likelihood of myocardial infarction. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Over the 15-month study period, the interpretation software diagnosed ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction in 67 of 2243 intensive care unit patients (2.99%) who had an electrocardiogram performed. In the final study population of 46 cases with electrocardiographic ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, 85% had peak troponin elevation<5 ng/mL, a strong suggestion against clinical ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. The cardiologist agreed with the computer interpretation in 39% (18 of 46) of cases, but of those 18 patients, only six showed a significant rise in the troponin level. The cardiologist disagreed with the computer interpretation in 60.9% (28 of 46) of cases and of those, one patient had a marked elevation of the cardiac troponin. CONCLUSIONS: ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction in the intensive care unit is a relatively common electrocardiographic reading both by standard interpretation software and by expert evaluation. In contrast to nonintensive care unit patients who present with chest pain, the electrocardiographic ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction diagnosis seems to be a nonspecific finding in the intensive care unit that is frequently the result of a variety of nonischemic processes. The vast majority of such patients do not have frank ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction.

N2  - The EarlySense Monitoring System has been developed to provide continuous monitoring  of heart rate (HR), respiration rate (RR), and bed motion for patients in medical/surgical, oncology, orthopedics, isolation, post-partum, skilled nursing facilities, long term acute care, and rehabilitation settings. The VA Office of the Deputy Under Secretary for Health for Policy and Services (10P) requested an independent evaluation from the VA Evidence-based Synthesis Program (ESP) to help guide the field as to EarlySense's monitoring capabilities, benefits and harms, impact on nurse staffing, and the overall effectiveness of the system. The USH seeks to better understand how this technology is being used in similar hospital settings in the US, what kinds of VA patients would be best served by it, and whether there are particular types of units or distribution of beds within those units for which this technology would be best suited. The ESP review team searched for and critically appraised relevant studies and systematic reviews and interviewed key informants, including VA nurses who have experience with the EarlySense system. In addition, we requested a Product Brief from the ECRI Institute, which is intended to serve as a companion to our report. WHAT IS EARLYSENSE? EarlySense is a low-acuity continuous monitor. As shown in the figure below, EarlySense consists of (1) a sensor that is placed under the patient's mattress, (2) a bedside monitor, (3) a central display station, and (4) proprietary analytic software that runs on a PC (not shown). The system is based on a piezoelectric sensor, sensitive to applied mechanical strains. The system differs from other patient monitoring systems in that it is a contactless device which eliminates the use of telemetry leads. While the patient is lying flat in bed, the system continuously records heart rate (HR), respiration rate (RR), and bed motion. Low-acuity systems do not provide cardiac waveforms (rhythm strips). They can display oxygen saturation if that is monitored using a separate system. EarlySense does not interface with the electronic medical record. Every 0.5 seconds, an updated HR reading is established based on analysis of the heart pulse pattern for the last 8 seconds, and an updated RR reading based on analysis of the last 1 minute of the respiration pattern. The system provides alerts if any of the parameters exceed predefined thresholds, which can be customized. Alerts can also be sent directly to nurses' mobile phones or pagers. EarlySense also provides bed exit alerts for patients at risk of falls, and includes a timer to remind nurses to turn patients (to help prevent the development of pressure ulcers). EarlySense can monitor up to 40 beds at one time. EarlySense received FDA 510(K) clearance as a Class II device based on demonstration that it was equivalent to devices that are used to monitor vital signs in patients undergoing sleep studies and in ambulatory patients. FDA clearance permits marketing in the US but does not mean that the FDA has found the device to have clinical efficacy. Rather, clearance means that EarlySense is equivalent to older devices in its ability to measure respiration rate and heart rate. PREDICTING CLINICAL DETERIORATION: Research conducted in the 1990s suggested that, among patients on general hospital wards, delays in treatment can lead to clinical deterioration and changes in vital signs and mental function that precede deterioration are often missed.. These observations led to the development of “rapid response teams” (RRTs) that are activated when a patient fulfills predefined criteria. The criteria are based on vital signs checks and assessment of mental status. Some systems also include decreased urinary output, oxygen saturation, difficulty breathing, increase in supplemental oxygen dose, and subjective concern detected by the nurse at the bedside. The Early Warning Scoring Systems (EWS), Modified EWS (MEWS), and the National EWS (NEWS) are commonly used sets of criteria. These systems are widely used in VA. In addition to indicating when to call the RRT, the systems also incorporate recommendations for the frequency of bedside assessment. In 2014, a systematic review from the VA Evidence-based Synthesis Program found that EWS/NEWS have strong predictive value for cardiac arrest and patient death and their use increases RRT calls, but the impact of EWS/NEWS on preventing patient mortality, transfers to the ICU, or length of hospital stay is uncertain. The ability to predict which patients are most likely to deteriorate has not been established. DeVita et al (2010) argue that while analyses of cardiac arrests and deaths indicate that most are preceded by vital signs lying outside normal ranges, most studies are retrospective, and because the total number of clinical deteriorations has not been determined, the ability of physiological abnormalities to predict risk of a serious event is unknown. Thus, in many circumstances, clinicians cannot predict which patients are most likely to deteriorate. In addition, lack of data prevents any estimate of how often severe deterioration leads to clinically adverse outcomes. In a study examining the association of delays in transfer to ICU, morbidity, and mortality, 11 physiological and laboratory markers of clinical instability were observed as having high sensitivity (88%) in identifying patients who were transferred to the ICU. These markers, however, lacked specificity (13%) and had very low positive predictive value (8%). This study suggests hospital staff cannot rely on markers alone to identify patients most at risk of deterioration without using considerable resources and incurring a high cost-benefit ratio. Because of the limitations in predicting patients at highest risk of a serious event, the ability of intermittent or continuous monitoring systems to detect severe physiological abnormalities in order to provide a true estimate of risk or to determine optimum response triggering values has not been fully established.,,,, Qualitative research suggests that nurses' worry or concern often precedes deterioration in vital signs, suggesting that better characterization of “concern” might lead to detection of deterioration at an early stage when intervention to prevent adverse events may be more effective. RATIONALE FOR CONTINUOUS VIAL SIGN MONITORING: The rationale for continuous vital sign monitoring is that suboptimal vital sign monitoring prior to an RRT referral may contribute to suboptimal patient outcomes. A more specific rationale for the EarlySense monitoring system is that alerts based on vital sign trends rather than just threshold parameters may add predictive ability to that of MEWS criteria and lead to earlier, more effective RRT calls. On busy wards, the frequency and accuracy of vital sign checks may be insufficient to detect deterioration, especially at night. Factors that may contribute to suboptimal patient monitoring include adverse working conditions, heavy workloads, lack of education and training, lack of experience and failure to recognize clinical urgency, errors in calculating EWS, communication deficits between doctors and nurses, cultural influences and intra-professional hierarchies, and lack of compliance. WHAT ARE THE ALTERNATIVES TO EARLYSENSE? Standard nurse-led monitoring in conjunction with EWS or MEWS is the most commonly used alternative to continuous vital sign monitoring. Other low-acuity systems are also alternatives to EarlySense. They are similar to EarlySense but require leads attached to the patient, and some require cables to connect with the display. All of these systems capture respiratory rate and heart rate, and some capture blood pressure, oxygen saturation, temperature, and ECG. Most contribute vital sign data directly to the electronic medical record. The market for low-acuity monitoring systems is growing rapidly, leading to intense technological development. Bedside monitors have sensors that are attached to the patient and connected via cables or leads to a display panel near the patient's bed and on remote displays. Manufacturers include Covidien, Masimo, Welch Allyn, and Zoe Medical. A major assumption underlying EarlySense is that these systems may be less safe than a contact-free low-acuity monitoring system because of cable management issues. Wearable monitors have sensors that attach to a small, lightweight display unit that enables monitoring even when the patient is out of bed. It is not known to what extent the need for contacts is a disadvantage for nursing staff or for patients. Few if any data are available about the use of these systems on general medical-surgical wards. For example, a search by ECRI found no clinical trials of GE Carescape or Nihon Kohden BSM-6000 bedside monitors. Philips and Sotera also manufacture wearable monitor systems. Medium-acuity telemetry systems are widely employed in the general medical and surgical wards. They are more expensive than EarlySense. An example is Intellivue (Phillips). This system uses ECG leads (wires) attached to the patient and to a small mobile device that fits into the patient's pocket. It records cardiac waveforms so that heart rate and rhythm are easily visualized. More expensive (and bulkier) models also monitor respiratory rate via the telemetry leads. Like EarlySense, these systems provide alerts if any of the parameters exceed predefined thresholds, which can be customized. Unlike EarlySense, the wearable sensors can monitor the patient in or out of bed, enabling continuous distant ECG monitoring. Continuous output can be viewed at the bedside and from a central monitoring system and text alerts are provided to nurses on mobile devices. The systems can analyze the ECG output to diagnose many cardiac arrhythmias. They are often used in conjunction with pulse oximetry (oxygen saturation monitoring) and, especially in post-operative patients, capnography.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Currently available implantable loop recorders (ILRs) are hampered by  limited memory, sensing artifacts, and need for manual memory download. Remote monitoring techniques that automatically transfer stored recordings for review may enhance ILR utility. However, automatic electrocardiograph (ECG) detection and transmission of an excessive number of tracings directly to physicians may be burdensome. This pilot study assessed the utility of direct ILR transmission to a central ECG monitoring center on the burden of data to be reviewed by the physician. METHODS: Patients with unexplained syncope were implanted with a novel ILR with automatic (i.e., independent of patient intervention) wireless telemetry download. Transmitted recordings underwent a two-step review process: initial algorithmic filtering followed by human overread at a monitoring center using predefined criteria. RESULTS: Forty patients were enrolled and followed for 8.5 ± 5.1 months. A total of 223,226 ECG recordings were transmitted to the monitoring center (on average 660 per patient per month). Algorithmic filtering eliminated 191,305 ECGs as artifact (89%), with monitoring center overread of 31,921 strips. Ultimately, 117 relevant ECGs were selected for further evaluation by the physician (0.0053%). One or more relevant ECGs were identified for 20 patients (50%). CONCLUSIONS: Automatic ILR recording and wireless technique is feasible for remote ECG monitoring by ILRs. However, sensitive criteria for recording and transmission may result in an excessive ECG burden. The two-step screening process in this pilot study minimized physician overread time while providing clinically relevant recordings in a substantial proportion of patients.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Team-based learning (TBL) can be one way of improving professional and  practical skills for nurses. This study explored the effectiveness of an electrocardiography training program using TBL for early-stage nurses in intensive care units. METHOD: This study used a pretest-posttest nonequivalent control group. A total of 65 participants were enrolled in the study (36 in the experimental group and 29 in the control group). Participants in the experimental group were trained with TBL, and participants in the control group had lecture-based learning on electrocardiography education. RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference between the team-based and lecture-based learning groups after the training in participants' knowledge of electrocardiography and reading ability of bedside (lead II rhythm) electrocardiography monitoring (p > .05). However, there was a statistically significant difference between the two groups in the reading ability of the 12-lead electrocardiography (p < .001). CONCLUSION: TBL was more effective in improving nurses' reading ability of the 12-lead electrocardiography. [J Contin Educ Nurs. 2020;51(4):174-180.].

N2  - BACKGROUND: Since the first well-known electrocardiogram (ECG) delineator based on  Wavelet Transform (WT) presented by Li et al. in 1995, a significant research effort has been devoted to the exploitation of this promising method. Its ability to reliably delineate the major waveform components (mono- or bi-phasic P wave, QRS, and mono- or bi-phasic T wave) would make it a suitable candidate for efficient online processing of ambulatory ECG signals. Unfortunately, previous implementations of this method adopt non-linear operators such as root mean square (RMS) or floating point algebra, which are computationally demanding. METHODS: This paper presents a 32-bit integer, linear algebra advanced approach to online QRS detection and P-QRS-T waves delineation of a single lead ECG signal, based on WT. RESULTS: The QRS detector performance was validated on the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database (sensitivity Se = 99.77%, positive predictive value P+ = 99.86%, on 109010 annotated beats) and on the European ST-T Database (Se = 99.81%, P+ = 99.56%, on 788050 annotated beats). The ECG delineator was validated on the QT Database, showing a mean error between manual and automatic annotation below 1.5 samples for all fiducial points: P-onset, P-peak, P-offset, QRS-onset, QRS-offset, T-peak, T-offset, and a mean standard deviation comparable to other established methods. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed algorithm exhibits reliable QRS detection as well as accurate ECG delineation, in spite of a simple structure built on integer linear algebra.

N2  - In recent years evidence has accumulated that ECG signals are of a nonlinear nature.  It has been recognized that strictly periodic cardiac rhythms are not accompanied by healthy conditions but, on the contrary, by pathological states. Therefore, the application of methods from nonlinear system theory for the analysis of ECG signals has gained increasing interest. Crucial for the application of nonlinear methods is the reconstruction (embedding) of the time series in a phase space with appropriate dimension. In this study continuous ECG signals of 12 healthy subjects recorded during different sleep stages were analysed. Proper embedding dimension was determined by application of two techniques the false nearest neighbours method and the saturation of the correlation dimension. Results for the ECG signals were compared with findings for simulated data (quasiperiodic dynamics, Lorenz data, white noise) and for phase randomized surrogates. Findings obtained with the two approaches suggest that embedding dimensions from 6 to 8 may be regarded as suitable for the topologically proper reconstruction of ECG signals.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Ventricular contractions in healthy individuals normally follow the  contractions of atria to facilitate more efficient pump action and cardiac output. With a ventricular ectopic beat (VEB), volume within the ventricles are pumped to the body's vessels before receiving blood from atria, thus causing inefficient blood circulation. VEBs tend to cause perturbations in the instantaneous heart rate time series, making the analysis of heart rate variability inappropriate around such events, or requiring special treatment (such as signal averaging). Moreover, VEB frequency can be indicative of life-threatening problems. However, VEBs can often mimic artifacts both in morphology and timing. Identification of VEBs is therefore an important unsolved problem. The aim of this study is to introduce a method of wavelet transform in combination with deep learning network for the classification of VEBs. APPROACH: We proposed a method to automatically discriminate VEB beats from other beats and artifacts with the use of wavelet transform of the electrocardiogram (ECG) and a convolutional neural network (CNN). Three types of wavelets (Morlet wavelet, Paul wavelet and Gaussian derivative) were used to transform segments of single-channel (1D) ECG waveforms to two-dimensional (2D) time-frequency 'images'. The 2D time-frequency images were then passed into a CNN to optimize the convolutional filters and classification. Ten-fold cross validation was used to evaluate the approach on the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database (MIT-BIH). The American Heart Association (AHA) database was then used as an independent dataset to evaluate the trained network. MAIN RESULTS: Ten-fold cross validation results on MIT-BIH showed that the proposed algorithm with Paul wavelet achieved an overall F1 score of 84.94% and accuracy of 97.96% on out of sample validation. Independent test on AHA resulted in an F1 score of 84.96% and accuracy of 97.36%. SIGNIFICANCE: The trained network possessed exceptional transferability across databases and generalization to unseen data.

N2  - Three-dimensional reconstruction of cardiac vasculature from angiographic C-arm CT  (rotational angiography) data is a major challenge. Motion artefacts corrupt image quality, reducing usability for diagnosis and guidance. Many state-of-the-art approaches depend on retrospective ECG-gating of projection data for image reconstruction. A trade-off has to be made regarding the size of the ECG-gating window. A large temporal window is desirable to avoid undersampling. However, residual motion will occur in a large window, causing motion artefacts. We present an algorithm to correct for residual motion. Our approach is based on a deformable 2D-2D registration between the forward projection of an initial, ECG-gated reconstruction, and the original projection data. The approach is fully automatic and does not require any complex segmentation of vasculature, or landmarks. The estimated motion is compensated for during the backprojection step of a subsequent reconstruction. We evaluated the method using the publicly available CAVAREV platform and on six human clinical datasets. We found a better visibility of structure, reduced motion artefacts, and increased sharpness of the vessels in the compensated reconstructions compared to the initial reconstructions. At the time of writing, our algorithm outperforms the leading result of the CAVAREV ranking list. For the clinical datasets, we found an average reduction of motion artefacts by 13 ± 6%. Vessel sharpness was improved by 25 ± 12% on average.

N2  - The purpose of this study was to define criteria suited to automated detection of  end QRS notching and slurring and to evaluate their accuracy. One hundred resting 12 lead ECGs from young adult men, split randomly into equal training and test sets, were examined independently by two reviewers for the presence of such notching or slurring. Consensus was reached by re-examination. Logic was added to the Glasgow resting ECG program to automate the detection of the phenomenon. After training, the automated detection had a sensitivity (SE) of 92.1% and a specificity (SP) of 96.6%. For the test set, SE was 90.5%, SP 96.5%. Two populations of healthy subjects--one Caucasian, one Nigerian--were analysed using the automated method. The prevalence of notching/slurring with peak/onset amplitude respectively ≥ 0.1 mV in two contiguous inferolateral leads was 23% and 29% respectively. In conclusion, the detection of end QRS notching or slurring can be automated with a high degree of accuracy.

N2  - Cardiovascular disease is the first cause of death around the world. In  accomplishing quick and accurate diagnosis, automatic electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis algorithm plays an important role, whose first step is QRS detection. The threshold algorithm of QRS complex detection is known for its high-speed computation and minimized memory storage. In this mobile era, threshold algorithm can be easily transported into portable, wearable, and wireless ECG systems. However, the detection rate of the threshold algorithm still calls for improvement. An improved adaptive threshold algorithm for QRS detection is reported in this paper. The main steps of this algorithm are preprocessing, peak finding, and adaptive threshold QRS detecting. The detection rate is 99.41%, the sensitivity (Se) is 99.72%, and the specificity (Sp) is 99.69% on the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia database. A comparison is also made with two other algorithms, to prove our superiority. The suspicious abnormal area is shown at the end of the algorithm and RR-Lorenz plot drawn for doctors and cardiologists to use as aid for diagnosis.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: The interval from J-point to T-wave peak (JTp) in ECG is a new  biomarker able to identify drugs that prolong the QT interval but have different ion channel effects. If JTp is not prolonged, the prolonged QT may be associated with multi ion channel block that may have low torsade de pointes risk. From the automatic ECG measurement perspective, accurate and repeatable measurement of JTp involves different challenges than QT. We evaluated algorithm performance and JTp challenges using the Philips DXL diagnostic 12/16/18-lead algorithm. Measurement of JTp represents a different use model. Standard use of corrected QT interval is clinical risk assessment on patients with cardiac disease or suspicion of heart disease. Drug safety trials involve a very different population - young healthy subjects - who commonly have J-waves, notches and slurs. Drug effects include difficult and unusual morphology such as flat T-waves, gentle notches, and multiple T-wave peaks. METHODS: The JTp initiative study provided ECGs collected from 22 young subjects (11 males and females) in randomized testing of dofetilide, quinidine, ranolazine, verapamil and placebo. We compare the JTp intervals between DXL algorithm and the FDA published measurements. The lead wise, vector-magnitude (VM), root-mean-square (RMS) and principal-component-analysis (PCA) representative beats were used to measure JTp and QT intervals. We also implemented four different methods for T peak detection for comparison. RESULTS: We found that JTp measurements were closer to the reference for combined leads RMS and PCA than individual leads. Differences in J-point location led to part of the JTp measurement difference because of the high prevalence of J-waves, notches and slurs. Larger differences were noted for drug effect causing multiple distinct T-wave peaks (Tp). The automated algorithm chooses the later peak while the reference was the earlier peak. Choosing among different algorithmic strategies in T peak measurement results in the tradeoff between stability and the accurate detection of calcium or sodium channel block. CONCLUSION: Measurement of JTp has different challenges than QT measurement. JTp measurement accuracy improved with combined leads RMS and PCA over lead II or V5.

N2  - Salvianolic acid A (SAA), one of the major active water-soluble salvianolic acids of  traditional Chinese medicine Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge, has been reported to be effective on anti-myocardial ischemia, anti-oxidation and anti-thrombus. This study aimed to investigate appropriate administration route on dogs with acute myocardial ischemia(AMI). Twenty-four dogs were randomized into four groups (n=6), model, oral administration of SAA (8 mg•kg⁻¹), intravenous administration of SAA (4 mg•kg⁻¹), intravenous administration of Herbesser(0.5 mg•kg⁻¹) as positive drug group. AMI model was established by ligating left anterior descending coronary arteries(LAD) of dogs. Changes of ST segment were determined by epicardial electrocardiogram(ECG), coronary blood flow (CBF) and myocardial oxygen consumption were measured by ultrasonic Doppler flow meter, serum creatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were observed by fully automatic biochemical analyser. Myocardial infarct size was assessed by nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT) staining. Both oral and intravenous administration of SAA reduced the myocardial infarct area/left ventricle area significantly [(16.73±6.52)% and (13.19±2.38)%, compared with (24.35±4.89)% in model group, P<0.01). Oral administration of SAA improved the ECG performance of Σ-ST from 30-190 min after ischemia (P<0.05-0.01), while intravenous SAA had a rapid onset (10-190 min after ischemia, P<0.05-0.01). Compared with model group, oral and intravenous SAA both decreased serum CK and LDH significantly (P<0.05-0.01), while the difference of intravenous administration is more significant. SAA protects myocardium in canine experimental myocardial infarction models. Intravenous administration of SAA alleviates myocardial infarction with greater significance than oral route.

N2  - Our long-term goal is the development of an automatic identifier of attentional  states. In order to accomplish it, we should first be able to identify different states based on physiological signals. So, the first aim of this paper is to identify the most appropriate features to detect a subject's high performance state. For that, a database of electrocardiographic (ECG) and photoplethysmographic (PPG) signals is recorded in two unequivocally defined states (rest and attention task) from up to 50 subjects as a sample of the population. Time and frequency parameters of heart/pulse rate variability have been computed from the ECG/PPG signals, respectively. Additionally, the respiratory rate has been estimated from both signals and also six morphological parameters from PPG. In total, 26 features are obtained for each subject. They provide information about the autonomic nervous system and the physiological response of the subject to an attention demand task. Results show an increase of sympathetic activation when the subjects perform the attention test. The amplitude and width of the PPG pulse were more sensitive than the classical sympathetic markers ([Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text]) for identifying this attentional state. State classification accuracy reaches a mean of [Formula: see text], a maximum of [Formula: see text], and a minimum of 85%, in the 100 classifications made by only selecting four parameters extracted from the PPG signal (pulse amplitude, pulsewidth, pulse downward slope, and mean pulse rate). These results suggest that attentional states could be identified by PPG.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of electroacupuncture (EA) preconditioning of  "Neiguan" (PC 6) on myocardial enzyme levels in acute recurrent myocardial ischemia rabbits so as to study its mechanisms underlying protection of ischemic myocardium. METHODS: A total of 40 healthy rabbits were randomized into normal control, myocardial ischemia (MI) model, EA preconditioning (EA-P), recurrent MI (RMI), EA-P+ RMI groups. MI model was duplicated by auricular intravenous administration of Posterior Pituitary Injection (PPI, 0.3 mL/kg). EA (2 Hz/70 Hz, 2-4 mA) was applied to bilateral PC 6 for 30 min, once daily for 7 d before MI. The contents of serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST), isoenzymes of creatine kinase (CK-MB), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatine kinase (CK), alpha-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (alpha-HBD) were detected by automatic biochemistry analyzer. RESULTS: Following administration of PPI, ECG-ST(II), serum AST, CK-MB, LDH, CK and alpha-HBD levels were increased significantly in the MI and RMI groups (P<0.01). Compared with the MI model group, ECG-ST(II), serum AST, CK-MB, LDH, CK and alpha-HBD levels were down-regulated considerably in the EA-P group (P<0.01), and ECG-ST(II), serum AST, CK-MB, LDH, CK and alpha-HBD levels were obviously lower in the EA-P+ RMI group than in the RMI group (P<0.01). No significant differences were found between the MI and RMI groups, and between EA-P and EA-P + RMI groups in the above-mentioned 6 indexes (P>0.05). CONCLUSION: Electroacupuncture preconditioning has a remarkable effect in the prevention of ischemic myocardial injury of both acute and recurrent myocardial ischemia in the rabbit, which is closely associated with its functions in lowering serum AST, CK-MB, LDH, CK and alpha-HBD contents.

N2  - Electrocardiogram (ECG) is the P-QRS-T wave which indicates the electrical activity  of the heart. The subtle changes in the amplitude and duration of the ECG signal depict the cardiac abnormality. It is very difficult to decipher these minute changes by the naked eye. Hence, a computer-aided diagnosis system will help the physicians to monitor the cardiac health. The ECG is a nonlinear and non-stationary signal. Hence, the hidden information in the ECG signal can be extracted using nonlinear method. In this paper, we have automatically classified normal and abnormal beats using higher order spectra (HOS) cumulants of wavelet packet decomposition (WPD). The abnormal beats are ventricular premature contractions (VPC) and Atrial premature contractions (APC). These HOS cumulant features of the WPD are subjected to principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce the number of features to five. Finally these features were fed to the support vector machine (SVM) with kernel functions for automatic classification. In our work, we have obtained the highest accuracy of 98.4% sensitivity and specificity of 98.9% and 98.0% respectively with radial basis function (RBF) kernel function and Meyer's wavelet (dmey) function. Our system is ready clinically to run on large amount of data sets.

N2  - Because of technical and practical difficulties in relation to increased body size,  haemodynamic monitoring of morbidly obese critically ill patients (i.e. body mass index &#8805;40 kg÷m2) may be challenging. Obese and non-obese patients are not so different with respect to haemodynamic monitoring and goals. The critical care physician, however, should be aware of the basic principles of the monitoring tools used. The theoretical assumptions and calculations of these tools could be invalid because of the high body weight and fat distribution. Although the method of assessing haemodynamic data may be more complex in morbidly obese patients, its interpretation should not be different from that in non-obese patients. Indeed, when indexed for body surface area or (predicted) lean body mass, reliable haemodynamic data are comparable etween obese and non-obese individuals.

N2  - Ventricular fibrillation (VF) is known to be the most dangerous cardiac arrhythmia,  frequently leading to sudden cardiac death (SCD). During VF, cardiac output drops to nil and, unless the fibrillation is promptly halted, death usually ensues within minutes. While delivering life saving electrical shocks is a method of preventing SCD, it has been recognized that some, though not many, VF episodes are self-terminating, and understanding the mechanism of spontaneous defibrillation might provide newer therapeutic options for treatment of this otherwise fatal arrhythmia. Using the phase statistics approach, recently developed to study financial and physiological time series, here, we reveal the timing characteristics of transient features of ventricular tachyarrhythmia (mostly VF) electrocardiogram (ECG) and find that there are three distinct types of probability density function (PDF) of phase distributions: uniform (UF), concave (CC), and convex (CV). Our data show that VF patients with UF or CC types of PDF have approximately the same probability of survival and nonsurvival, while VF patients with CV type PDF have zero probability of survival, implying that their VF episodes are never self-terminating. Our results suggest that detailed phase statistics of human ECG data may be a key to understanding the mechanism of spontaneous defibrillation of fatal VF.

N2  - The aim of this study was to investigate the image quality and radiation dose of  different scanning protocols in dual-source CT cardiothoracic angiography for children with tetralogy of Fallot (TOF). Seventy-five consecutive children with known or suspected TOF were enrolled to undergo prospective ECG-triggering sequential dual-source CT (DSCT) cardiothoracic angiography. According to the scanning protocols, these patients were randomly divided into 3 groups: fixed delay time (FDT, n = 25, group A), automatic bolus-tracking (ABT, n = 25, group B) and manual bolus-tracking (MBT, n = 25, group C). Subjective and objective image quality were evaluated. The radiation doses were recorded. The image quality scores of group C were significantly higher than those of group A and B. The absolute value of difference (D-value) on CT attenuation between left (CT(LV)) and right ventricle (CT(RV)) in group C was significantly lower than that in group A and B. The total effective dose of groups A, B and C were 0.39 ± 0.06 mSv, 0.40 ± 0.07 mSv and 0.40 ± 0.08 mSv, respectively. There was no significant difference among 3 groups (P = 0.722). Scanning protocol has significantly impacts on the image quality of cardiovascular structures for TOF patients. Compared with the conventional scanning protocols FDT and ABT, the MBT technique provides high image quality and achieves more homogenous attenuation among different patients with TOF.

N2  - While cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are commonly diagnosed by cardiologists via  inspecting electrocardiogram (ECG) waveforms, these decisions can be supported by a data-driven approach, which may automate this process. An automatic diagnostic approach often employs hand-crafted features extracted from ECG waveforms. These features, however, do not generalise well, challenged by variation in acquisition settings such as sampling rate and mounting points. Existing deep learning (DL) approaches, on the other hand, extract features from ECG automatically but require construction of dedicated networks that require huge data and computational resource if trained from scratch. Here we propose an end-to-end trainable cross-domain transfer learning for CVD classification from ECG waveforms, by utilising existing vision-based CNN frameworks as feature extractors, followed by ECG feature learning layers. Because these frameworks are designed for image inputs, we employ a stacked spectrogram representation of multi-lead ECG waveforms as a preprocessing step. We also proposed a fusion of multiple ECG leads, using plausible stacking arrangements of the spectrograms, to encode their spatial relations. The proposed approach is validated on multiple ECG datasets and competitive performance is achieved.

N2  - AIM: Accurate chest compression detection is key to evaluate cardiopulmonary  resuscitation (CPR) quality. Two automatic compression detectors were developed, for the compression depth (CD), and for the thoracic impedance (TI). The objective was to evaluate their accuracy for compression detection and for CPR quality assessment. METHODS: Compressions were manually annotated using the force and ECG in 38 out-of-hospital resuscitation episodes, comprising 869 min and 67,402 compressions. Compressions were detected using a negative peak detector for the CD. For the TI, an adaptive peak detector based on the amplitude and duration of TI fluctuations was used. Chest compression rate (CC-rate) and chest compression fraction (CCF) were calculated for the episodes and for every minute within each episode. CC-rate for rescuer feedback was calculated every 8 consecutive compressions. RESULTS: The sensitivity and positive predictive value were 98.4% and 99.8% using CD, and 94.2% and 97.4% using TI. The mean CCF and CC-rate obtained from both detectors showed no significant differences with those obtained from the annotations (P>0.6). The Bland-Altman analysis showed acceptable 95% limits of agreement between the annotations and the detectors for the per-minute CCF, per-minute CC-rate, and CC-rate for feedback. For the detector based on TI, only 3.7% of CC-rate feedbacks had an error larger than 5%. CONCLUSION: Automatic compression detectors based on the CD and TI signals are very accurate. In most cases, episode review could safely rely on these detectors without resorting to manual review. Automatic feedback on rate can be accurately done using the impedance channel.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine and compare HRV parameters in poorly and well  controlled type 2 diabetes. 54 normotensive type 2 diabetes patients without clinical signs of CAN were enrolled; 29 poorly controlled (HbA1c ≥ 7%) and 25 controls matched for age, sex and BMI. HRV analysis was performed using 24-h ambulatory ECG, with automatic estimation of the time and frequency domain ranges. Comparisons were performed using Mann-Whitney test. RESULTS: We included 54 participants (26 males) aged 56 years [43-62], with known duration of diabetes 3 years [1-7]. HbA1c was 10.1% [9.1-11.9] vs 5.3% [5.1-6.3] (p < 0.001). Blood pressure was 126 mmHg [121-130] vs 124 mmHg [113-133] in the poorly controlled group and the well-controlled group respectively (p = 0.5). 24-h mean heart rate was significantly higher in poorly controlled vs well controlled patients (79 bpm [77-83] vs 75 bpm [69-79], p = 0.006). In the time domain analysis, markers of the overall variability were lower and thus altered in the poorly controlled group (SDNN: 102 ms [90.5-111.1] vs 112.3 ms [104.4-131.2], p = 0.01 and SDANN 88 ms [72.9-99.7] vs 97.8 ms [91.8-114.5], p = 0.01). The frequency domain analysis showed trends towards lower values of sympathovagal balance markers in the poorly controlled group. Reduced HRV is associated with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus and may be an early marker in clinical practice.

N2  - Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common heart arrhythmia, and 12-lead  electrocardiogram (ECG) is regarded as the gold standard for AF diagnosis. Highly accurate diagnosis of AF based on 12-lead ECG is valuable and remains challenging. In this paper, we proposed a novel method with high accuracy for AF detection based on deep learning. The proposed method constructed a novel one-dimensional deep densely connected neural network (DDNN) to detect AF in ECG waveforms with a length of 10s. A large set of 16,557 12-lead ECG recordings collected from multiple hospitals and wearable ECG devices were used to evaluate the performance of the DDNN. In the test dataset (3312 12-lead ECG recordings), the DDNN obtained high performance with an accuracy of 99.35 ± 0.26%, a sensitivity of 99.19 ± 0.31%, and a specificity of 99.44 ± 0.17%. Its high performance and automatic nature both demonstrate that the proposed network has a great potential to be applied to clinical computer-aided diagnosis of AF or future screening of AF in wearable devices.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to develop an automated detection method, for prescreening  purposes, of early repolarization (ER) pattern with slur/notch configuration in electrocardiogram (ECG) signals using a waveform prototype-based feature vector for supervised classification. APPROACH: The feature vectors consist of fragments of the ECG signal where the ER pattern is located, instead of abstract descriptive variables of ECG waveforms. The tested classifiers included linear discriminant analysis, k-nearest neighbor algorithm, and support vector machine (SVM). MAIN RESULTS: SVM showed the best performance in Friedman tests in our test data including 5676 subjects representing 45 408 leads. Accuracies of the different classifiers showed results well over 90%, indicating that the waveform prototype-based feature vector is an effective representation of the differences between ECG signals with and without the ER pattern. The accuracy of inferior ER was 92.74% and 92.21% for lateral ER. The sensitivity achieved was 91.80% and specificity was 92.73%. SIGNIFICANCE: The algorithm presented here showed good performance results, indicating that it could be used as a prescreening tool of ER, and it provides an additional identification of critical cases based on the distances to the classifier decision boundary, which are close to the 0.1 mV threshold and are difficult to label.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Seizure-related modulation of heart rate (HR) was examined extensively in  previous studies. However, the overall effect on HR attributable to epileptic seizures is difficult to determine, given the considerable fluctuations of HR before and during seizures. Here, we developed a semi-automatic procedure allowing quantification of the total impact of seizures on HR and determination of temporal relationships between seizure onset assessed by intracranial EEG (iEEG) and ECG. METHODS: ECG and iEEG data of epilepsy patients undergoing video-EEG telemetry for epilepsy surgery with bilateral hippocampal depth electrodes were analysed retrospectively. Consecutive RR intervals and HR profiles were determined using R detection algorithms. Novel features including the normalized ictal area under the curve (niAUC), as well as the time point of ECG onset (HR breakpoint) were calculated. Selected HR features were compared to widely-used manually acquired measures. Data are given as median ± SD. RESULTS: Fifteen patients had a total of 34 seizures with left-hippocampal and 37 seizures with right-hippocampal onset. HR increased by 9 ± 19% during seizures. Latency between iEEG seizure-onset to the HR breakpoint was 23 ± 22 s. No significant difference between left- and right-hippocampal seizures was observed with respect to HR increases, latencies and niAUC. A comparison between results of the semi-automatic and manual approach revealed that ictal HR changes showed a higher correlation (r = 0.6) than niAUC (r = 0.4). CONCLUSIONS: The proposed semi-automatic approach to analyze continuous HR data provides useful tools for estimating the overall effect of seizures on HR in greater detail. Our results suggest that the side of hippocampal seizure onset has no significant effect on the latency and extent of ictal HR changes. The algorithms may be of further use in clinical research and the development of seizure detection devices.

N2  - T wave alternans is defined as changes in the T wave amplitude in an ABABAB-pattern.  It can be found in ECG signals of patients with heart diseases and is a possible indicator to predict the risk on sudden cardiac death. Due to its low amplitude, robust automatic T wave alternans detection is a difficult task. We present a new method to detect T wave alternans in multichannel ECG signals. The use of tensors (multidimensional matrices) permits the combination of the information present in different channels, making detection more reliable. The possibility of decomposition of incomplete tensors is exploited to deal with noisy ECG segments. Using a sliding window of 128 heartbeats, a tensor is constructed of the T waves of all channels. Canonical Polyadic Decomposition is applied to this tensor and the resulting loading vectors are examined for information about the T wave behavior in three dimensions. T wave alternans is detected using a sign change counting method that is able to extract both the T wave alternans length and magnitude. When applying this novel method to a database of patients with multiple positive T wave alternans tests using the clinically available spectral method tests, both the length and the magnitude of the detected T wave alternans is larger for these subjects than for subjects in a control group.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Prehospital electrocardiography (PH ECG) is becoming the standard of  care for patients activating Emergency Medical Services for symptoms of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Little is known about the prognostic value of ischemia found on PH ECG. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine whether manifestations of acute myocardial ischemia on PH ECG are predictive of adverse hospital outcomes. METHODS: This study was a retrospective analysis of all PH ECGs recorded in 630 patients who called 911 for symptoms of ACS and were enrolled in a prospective clinical trial. ST-segment monitoring software was added to the PH ECG device with automatic storage and transmission of ECGs to the destination Emergency Department. Patient medical records were reviewed for adverse hospital outcomes. RESULTS: In 630 patients who called 911 for ACS symptoms, 270 (42.9%) had PH ECG evidence of ischemia. Overall, 37% of patients with PH ECG ischemia had adverse hospital outcomes compared with 27% of patients without PH ECG ischemia (p < 0.05). Those with PH ECG ischemia were 1.55 times more likely to have adverse hospital outcomes than those without PH ECG ischemia (95% CI 1.09-2.21; p < 0.05), after controlling for other predictors of adverse hospital outcomes (i.e., age, sex, and medical history). CONCLUSIONS: Evidence of ischemia on PH ECG is an independent predictor of adverse hospital outcomes. ST-segment monitoring in the prehospital setting can identify high-risk patients with symptoms of ACS and provide important prognostic information at presentation to the Emergency Department.

N2  - In this paper we present the first steps in developing SmartHypnos, an easy to use  and user friendly graphical user interface, which aims to provide polysomngographic data visualization and the detection and classification of sleep related events. Currently SmartHypnos supports the visualization of EEG, ECG, EOG and EMG signals, and respiratory signals such as nasal pressure, thermistor, oxygen saturation, thoracic and abdominal belt recordings. All these are incorporated into an interface that provides quick and effortless access to the signals mentioned above. The interface displays automatic sleep staging capabilities as well as the detection of apnea events with accuracy rates surpassing 80%. It is expected that SmartHypnos will reduce the time required to analyze sleep data and also reduce possible human errors.

N2  - Heartbeat classification is a crucial step for arrhythmia diagnosis during  electrocardiographic (ECG) analysis. The new scenario of wireless body sensor network- (WBSN-) enabled ECG monitoring puts forward a higher-level demand for this traditional ECG analysis task. Previously reported methods mainly addressed this requirement with the applications of a shallow structured classifier and expert-designed features. In this study, modified frequency slice wavelet transform (MFSWT) was firstly employed to produce the time-frequency image for heartbeat signal. Then the deep learning (DL) method was performed for the heartbeat classification. Here, we proposed a novel model incorporating automatic feature abstraction and a deep neural network (DNN) classifier. Features were automatically abstracted by the stacked denoising auto-encoder (SDA) from the transferred time-frequency image. DNN classifier was constructed by an encoder layer of SDA and a softmax layer. In addition, a deterministic patient-specific heartbeat classifier was achieved by fine-tuning on heartbeat samples, which included a small subset of individual samples. The performance of the proposed model was evaluated on the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database. Results showed that an overall accuracy of 97.5% was achieved using the proposed model, confirming that the proposed DNN model is a powerful tool for heartbeat pattern recognition.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: This study investigated sensitivity and false detection rate of a  multimodal automatic seizure detection algorithm and the applicability to reduced electrode montages for long-term seizure documentation in epilepsy patients. METHODS: An automatic seizure detection algorithm based on EEG, EMG, and ECG signals was developed. EEG/ECG recordings of 92 patients from two epilepsy monitoring units including 494 seizures were used to assess detection performance. EMG data were extracted by bandpass filtering of EEG signals. Sensitivity and false detection rate were evaluated for each signal modality and for reduced electrode montages. RESULTS: All focal seizures evolving to bilateral tonic-clonic (BTCS, n=50) and 89% of focal seizures (FS, n=139) were detected. Average sensitivity in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) patients was 94% and 74% in extratemporal lobe epilepsy (XTLE) patients. Overall detection sensitivity was 86%. Average false detection rate was 12.8 false detections in 24h (FD/24h) for TLE and 22 FD/24h in XTLE patients. Utilization of 8 frontal and temporal electrodes reduced average sensitivity from 86% to 81%. CONCLUSION: Our automatic multimodal seizure detection algorithm shows high sensitivity with full and reduced electrode montages. SIGNIFICANCE: Evaluation of different signal modalities and electrode montages paces the way for semi-automatic seizure documentation systems.

N2  - CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: URL: http://clinicaltrials.gov. Unique Identifier:  NCT00697359. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate rhythm control up to two years after atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation and its relation to reported symptoms. BACKGROUND: The implantable loop recorder (ILR) continuously records the electrocardiogram (ECG), has an automatic AF detection algorithm, and has a possibility for patients to activate an ECG recording during symptoms. METHODS: Fifty-seven patients (mean age 57 ± 9 years, 60% male, 88% paroxysmal AF) underwent AF ablation following ILR implantation. Device data were downloaded at the ablation and three, six, 12, 18, and 24 months after ablation. RESULTS: Fifty-four patients completed the two-year follow-up. Thirteen (24%) patients had no AF episodes detected by ILR during follow-up. Ten of 41 patients (24%) with AF recurrence were only detected by ILR and AF recurrences were detected earlier by ILR (P < 0.001). The median AF burden in patients with AF recurrence was 5.7% (interquartile range 0.4-14.4) and was even lower in patients with AF only detected by ILR (P = 0.001). Forty-eight % of the patients indicated symptoms via the patient activator but 33% of those recordings were not due to AF. Early AF recurrence (within 3 months) was highly associated with later AF recurrence (P < 0.001). AF burden >0.5% and longest AF episode >6 hours before the ablation were independent predictors of AF recurrence during intermittent but not continuous monitoring. CONCLUSIONS: After AF ablation, the AF burden was low throughout the 24 months follow-up. Nevertheless, symptoms were commonly indicated but one-third of patient-activated recordings did not show AF. Continuous monitoring was superior to intermittent follow-up in detecting AF episodes and assessing the AF burden.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: There is a need to monitor the heart rhythm in resuscitation to improve  treatment quality. Resuscitation rhythms are categorized into: ventricular tachycardia (VT), ventricular fibrillation (VF), pulseless electrical activity (PEA), asystole (AS), and pulse-generating rhythm (PR). Manual annotation of rhythms is time-consuming and infeasible for large datasets. Our objective was to develop ECG-based algorithms for the retrospective and automatic classification of resuscitation cardiac rhythms. METHODS: The dataset consisted of 1631 3-s ECG segments with clinical rhythm annotations, obtained from 298 out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients. In total, 47 wavelet- and time-domain-based features were computed from the ECG. Features were selected using a wrapper-based feature selection architecture. Classifiers based on Bayesian decision theory, k-nearest neighbor, k-local hyperplane distance nearest neighbor, artificial neural network (ANN), and ensemble of decision trees were studied. RESULTS: The best results were obtained for ANN classifier with Bayesian regularization backpropagation training algorithm with 14 features, which forms the proposed algorithm. The overall accuracy for the proposed algorithm was 78.5%. The sensitivities (and positive-predictive-values) for AS, PEA, PR, VF, and VT were 88.7% (91.0%), 68.9% (70.4%), 65.9% (69.0%), 86.2% (83.8%), and 78.8% (72.9%), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate that it is possible to classify resuscitation cardiac rhythms automatically, but the accuracy for the organized rhythms (PEA and PR) is low. SIGNIFICANCE: We have made an important step toward making classification of resuscitation rhythms more efficient in the sense of minimal feedback from human experts.

METHODS: The volunteers for this study were 15 male university student. 15 subjects were taken basic physical examinations such as height, weight and BMI before the experiment. Primary tests were examined of VO2max per weight of each subjects by graded exercise test using Bruce protocol. Each of five subject was divided 3 groups (CON, ECGⅠ, ECGⅡ) by matched method based on weight and VO2max per weight what gained of primary test for minimize the differences of exercise capacity and ingestion of each groups. For the secondary tests, the groups of subjects were taken their materials before and after exercise as a blind test. After the ingestion, subjects were experimented on exercise test of VO2max 80% by treadmill until the all-out. Heart rate was measured by 1minute interval, and respiratory variables were analyzed VO2, VE, VT, RR and so on by automatic respiratory analyzer. And exercise exhaustion time was determined by stopwatch. Moreover, HRV was measured after exercise and recovery 3 min. RESULTS: Among the intake groups, ECGⅡ was showed the longest of exercise exhaustion time more than CON group (p = .05). Result of heart rate during exercise according to intake groups, there was significant differences of each time (p < .001), however, not significant differences of each groups and group verse time (p > .05). Result of RPE during exercise according to intake groups, there was significant differences of each time (p < .001), however, not significant differences of each groups and group verse time (p > .05). CONCLUSION: In conclusion, EDGⅡ showed the significant increase of exercise exhaustion time more than CON group (p=.05) and not significant differences in HR, RPE, RER, HRV, HRR, blood pressure (p > .05). Therefore, 2.5 mg/kg(-1) ingestion of energy drink might be positive effect to increase exercise performance capacity without side-effect in cardiovascular disease.

N2  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a type of arrhythmia with high  incidence. Automatic AF detection methods have been studied in previous works. However, a model cannot be used all the time without any improvement. And updating model requires adequate data and cost. Therefore, this study aims at finding a low-cost way to choose learning samples and developing an incremental learning system for AF detection. METHODS: Based on transfer learning and active learning, this paper proposed a loop-locked framework integrating AF diagnose, label query, and model fine-tuning. In the pre-training stage, a novel multiple-input deep neural network (MIDNN) is pre-trained using labeled samples from an original training set. In practical application, the model can be used for AF detection. Meanwhile, continuous data is collected to form the candidate set. In the incremental learning stage, the model was fine-tuned continuously by the most informative samples in the candidate set. These samples are selected from the candidate set based on the pre-trained model and a new active learning strategy. The strategy combines the features and the uncertainty of the predicted results. RESULTS: In order to evaluate the method, the MIT-BIH atrial fibrillation database was used for pre-training and samples of the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database were taken as candidate set. The initial values of Acc, Sen, and PPV were 87.40%, 97.46%, and 81.11%. These indexes reached to the top values of 97.53%, 100.00%, and 95.29% after 14 iterations. Hence, the number of queries was saved by 90.67%. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed system is able to update the model continuously and reduce the labeling cost over 90%. The comparisons demonstrated the effectiveness of MIDNN model and the suitability of novel learning strategy for AF. Moreover, this framework can be extended to other biomedical applications.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Pacemaker battery depletion triggers alert for replacement notification  and results in automatic reprogramming, which has been shown to be associated with relevant cardiorespiratory symptoms and adverse clinical events. OBJECTIVE: Determine if electrocardiogram (ECG) pacing features may be predictive of pacemaker battery depletion and clinical risk. METHODS: This is an ECG substudy of a cohort analysis of 298 subjects referred for pacemaker generator replacement from 2006 to 2017. Electronic medical record review was performed; clinical, ECG, and pacemaker characteristics were abstracted. We applied two ECG prediction rules for pacemaker battery depletion that are relevant to all major pacemaker manufacturers except Boston Scientific and MicroPort: (1) atrial pacing not at a multiple of 10 and (2) nonsynchronous ventricular pacing not at a multiple of 10, to determine diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, and risk in applicable ECG subjects. RESULTS: We excluded 32 subjects not at replacement notification or duplicate surgeries. Overall, 176 of 266 subjects (66.2%) demonstrated atrial pacing or nonsynchronous ventricular pacing on preoperative ECG. When utilizing both rules, 139 of 176 preoperative ECGs and 12 of 163 postoperative ECGs met criteria for battery depletion yielding reasonable sensitivity (79.0%), high specificity (92.6%), and a positive likelihood ratio of 11.6:1. These rules were associated with significant increase in cardiorespiratory symptoms (P < .001) and adverse clinical events (P < .025). CONCLUSIONS: The "Rules of Ten" provided reasonable sensitivity and specificity for detecting replacement notification in pacemaker subjects with an applicable ECG. This ECG tool may help clinicians identify most patients with pacemaker battery depletion at significant clinical risk.

N2  - Sleep disorders, which negatively affect an individual's daily quality of life, are  a common problem for most of society. The most dangerous sleep disorder is obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS), which manifests itself during sleep and can cause the sudden death of patients. Many important parameters related to the diagnosis and treatments of such sleep disorders are simultaneously examined. This process is exhausting and time-consuming for experts and also requires experience; thus, it can cause difference of opinion among experts. Because of this, automatic sleep staging systems have been designed. In this study, a decision support system was developed to determine OSAS patients. In the developed decision support system, unlike in the available published literature, patient and healthy individual classification was performed using only the Pulse Transition Time (PTT) parameter rather than other parameters obtained from polysomnographic data like ECG (Electrocardiogram), EEG (Electroencephalography), carbon dioxide measurement and EMG (Electromyography). The suggested method can perform feature extraction from PTT signals by means of a deep-learning method. AlexNet and VGG-16, which are two Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models, have been used for feature extraction. With the features obtained, patients and healthy individuals were classified by the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and the k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) algorithms. When the performance of the study was compared with other studies in published literature, it was seen that satisfactory results were obtained.

N2  - Complexity-based analyses may quantify abnormalities in heart rate variability  (HRV). The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical and prognostic significances of dynamic HRV changes in patients with stress-induced cardiomyopathy Takotsubo syndrome (TS) by means of linear and nonlinear analysis. Patients with TS were included in study after complete noninvasive and invasive cardiovascular diagnostic evaluation and compared to an age and gender matched control group of healthy subjects. Series of R-R interval and of ST-T interval values were obtained from 24-h ECG recordings after digital sampling. HRV analysis was performed by 'range rescaled analysis' to determine the Hurst exponent, by detrended fluctuation analysis to quantify fractal long-range correlation properties, and by approximate entropy to assess time-series predictability. Short- and long-term fractal-scaling exponents were significantly higher in patients with TS in acute phases, opposite to lower approximate entropy and Hurst exponent, but all variables normalized in a few weeks. Dynamic HRV analysis allows assessing changes in complexity features of HRV in TS patients during the acute stage, and to monitor recovery after treatment, thus complementing traditional ECG and clinically analysis.

N2  - Despite significant advances in adult clinical electrocardiography (ECG) signal  processing techniques and the power of digital processors, the analysis of non-invasive foetal ECG (NI-FECG) is still in its infancy. The Physionet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2013 addresses some of these limitations by making a set of FECG data publicly available to the scientific community for evaluation of signal processing techniques.The abdominal ECG signals were first preprocessed with a band-pass filter in order to remove higher frequencies and baseline wander. A notch filter to remove power interferences at 50 Hz or 60 Hz was applied if required. The signals were then normalized before applying various source separation techniques to cancel the maternal ECG. These techniques included: template subtraction, principal/independent component analysis, extended Kalman filter and a combination of a subset of these methods (FUSE method). Foetal QRS detection was performed on all residuals using a Pan and Tompkins QRS detector and the residual channel with the smoothest foetal heart rate time series was selected.The FUSE algorithm performed better than all the individual methods on the training data set. On the validation and test sets, the best Challenge scores obtained were E1 = 179.44, E2 = 20.79, E3 = 153.07, E4 = 29.62 and E5 = 4.67 for events 1-5 respectively using the FUSE method. These were the best Challenge scores for E1 and E2 and third and second best Challenge scores for E3, E4 and E5 out of the 53 international teams that entered the Challenge. The results demonstrated that existing standard approaches for foetal heart rate estimation can be improved by fusing estimators together. We provide open source code to enable benchmarking for each of the standard approaches described.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Terminal QRS distortion on the electrocardiogram (ECG) is a sign of  severe ischemia in patients with STEMI and can be quantified by the Sclarovsky-Birnbaum Severity of Ischemia. Due to score complexity, it has not been applied in clinical practice. Automatic scoring of digitally recorded ECGs could facilitate clinical application. We aimed to develop an automatic algorithm for the severity of ischemia. METHODS: Development set: 50 STEMI ECGs were manually (Manual-score) and automatically (Auto-score) scored by our designed algorithm. The agreement between Manual- and Auto-score was assessed by kappa statistics. Test set: ECGs from 199 STEMI patients were assigned a severity grade (severe or non-severe ischemia) by the Auto-score. Infarct size estimated by median peak Troponin T (TnT) and Creatinine Kinase Myocardial Band (CKMB) was tested between the groups. RESULTS: The agreement between Manual- and Auto-score was 0.83 ((95% CI 0.55-1.00), p < 0.0001), sensitivity 75% and specificity 100%, PPV 100% and NPV 94.6%. In the test set 152 (76%) patients were male, mean age 61 ± 12 years. The Auto-score designated severe ischemia in 42 (21%) and non-severe ischemia in 157 (79%) patients. Patients with ECG signs of severe vs. non-severe ischemia had significantly higher levels of biomarkers of infarct size. In multiple linear regression, ECG sign of severe ischemia was an independent predictor for higher TnT and CKMB levels. CONCLUSION: The automatic ECG algorithm for severity of ischemia in STEMI performs adequately for clinical use. Severe ischemia obtained by the Auto-score was associated with biomarker estimated larger infarct size.

N2  - Seismocardiography (SCG) is the measurement of vibrations in the sternum caused by  the beating of the heart. Precise cardiac mechanical timings that are easily obtained from SCG are critically dependent on accurate identification of fiducial points. So far, SCG annotation has relied on concurrent ECG measurements. An algorithm capable of annotating SCG without the use any other concurrent measurement was designed. We subjected 18 participants to graded lower body negative pressure. We collected ECG and SCG, obtained R peaks from the former, and annotated the latter by hand, using these identified peaks. We also annotated the SCG automatically. We compared the isovolumic moment timings obtained by hand to those obtained using our algorithm. Mean  ±  confidence interval of the percentage of accurately annotated cardiac cycles were [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], and [Formula: see text] for levels of negative pressure 0, -20, -30, -40, and  -50 mmHg. LF/HF ratios, the relative power of low-frequency variations to high-frequency variations in heart beat intervals, obtained from isovolumic moments were also compared to those obtained from R peaks. The mean differences  ±  confidence interval were [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], and [Formula: see text] for increasing levels of negative pressure. The accuracy and consistency of the algorithm enables the use of SCG as a stand-alone heart monitoring tool in healthy individuals at rest, and could serve as a basis for an eventual application in pathological cases.

N2  - This study aimed to test how different QT interval variability (QTV) indices change  in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and congestive heart failure (CHF). Twenty-nine healthy volunteers, 29 age-matched CAD patients, and 20 age-matched CHF patients were studied. QT time series were derived from 5-min resting lead-II electrocardiogram (ECG). Time domain indices [mean, SD, and QT variability index (QTVI)], frequency-domain indices (LF and HF), and nonlinear indices [sample entropy (SampEn), permutation entropy (PE), and dynamical patterns] were calculated. In order to account for possible influence of heart rate (HR) on QTV, all the calculations except QTVI were repeated on HR-corrected QT time series (QTc) using three correction methods (i.e., Bazett, Fridericia, and Framingham method). Results showed that CHF patients exhibited increased mean, increased SD, increased LF and HF, decreased T-wave amplitude, increased QTVI, and decreased PE, while showed no significant changes in SampEn. Interestingly, CHF patients also showed significantly changed distribution of the dynamical patterns with less monotonously changing patterns while more fluctuated patterns. In CAD group, only QTVI was found significantly increased as compared with healthy controls. Results after HR correction were in common with those before HR correction except for QTc based on Bazett correction. Graphical abstract Fig. The framework of this paper. The arrows show the sequential analysis of the data.

N2  - We designed and developed a special purpose interactive graphic editing tool  semi-automatic (Semia) to annotate transient ischaemic ST segment episodes and other non-ischaemic ST segment events in 24h ambulatory electrocardiogram (ECG) records. The tool allows representation and viewing of the data, interaction with the data globally and locally at different resolutions, examining data at any point, manual adjustment of heart-beat fiducial points, and manual and automatic editing of annotations. Efficient and fast display of ambulatory ECG signal waveforms, display of diagnostic and morphology feature-vector time-series, dynamic interface controls, and automated procedures to help annotate, made the tool efficient, user friendly and usable. Human expert annotators used the Semia tool to successfully annotate the Long-Term ST database (LTST DB), a result of a multinational effort. The tool supported paperless editing of annotations at dislocated geographical sites. We present design, characteristic "look and feel", functionality, and development of Semia annotating tool.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Assessment of myocardial function can be performed at higher noise levels  than necessary for coronary arterial evaluation. We evaluated image quality and radiation exposure of a dose-conserving function-only acquisition vs retrospectively electrocardiogram(ECG)-gated coronary CTA with automatic tube current modulation. METHODS: Of 26 patients who underwent clinically indicated coronary CTA for coronary and function evaluation, 13 (Group I) underwent prospectively ECG-triggered coronary CTA, followed by low-dose retrospectively ECG-gated scan for function (128-slice dual-source, 80 kVp; reference tube current, 100 mA; 8-mm-thick multiplanar reformatted reconstructions) performed either immediately (n = 6) or after 5- to 10-min delay for infarct assessment (n = 7). 13 corresponding controls (Group II) underwent retrospectively ECG-gated protocols (automatic tube potential selection with CARE kV/CARE Dose 4D; Siemens Healthcare, Forchheim, Germany) with aggressive dose modulation. Image quality assessment was performed on the six Group I subjects who underwent early post-contrast dedicated function scan and corresponding controls. Radiation exposure was based on dose-length product. RESULTS: Contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) was preserved throughout the cardiac cycle in Group I and varied according to dose modulation in Group II. Visual image quality indices were similar during end systole but were better in Group II at end diastole. Although the total radiation exposure was equivalent in Group I and Group II (284 vs 280 mGy cm), the median radiation exposure associated with only the dedicated function scan was 138 mGy cm (interquartile range, 116-203 mGy cm). CONCLUSION: A low-dose retrospective ECG-gated protocol permits assessment of myocardial function at a median radiation exposure of 138 mGy cm and offers more consistent multiphase CNR vs traditional ECG-modulation protocols. This is useful for pure functional evaluation or as an adjunct to single-phase scan modes. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: Radiation exposure can be limited with a tailored myocardial function CT protocol while maintaining preserved images.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Nearly 60% of patients undergoing mitral valve (MV) operations are  affected by atrial fibrillation (AF). Cox Maze III ablation is one of the effective ways for restoring sinus rhythm for patients undergoing open heart surgery. The aim of present study was to evaluate efficacy of Maze III ablation procedure for restoring sinus rhythm among patients who had underwent open heart surgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: During present descriptive-analytic prospective study 114 patients with chronic AF had undergone open heart surgery for their valvular or coronary artery diseases in Educational-Medical centres of Tabriz University of Medical Sciences (Tabriz, Iran) 2006-2012, were included in the study. For all patients Maze III ablation was done. Patients were evaluated by 12 lead electrocardiography (ECG) and 24 hours ambulatory ECG monitoring after 3-6 years (mean 4.8) of follow-up. RESULT: Patients' rhythm before Cox Maze III surgery was chronic AF in all patients. All patients were discharged from operating room with sinus rhythm. During intensive care unit (ICU) hospitalization, rhythm of 34 patients changed to AF and 80 patients had sinus rhythm. Sixteen patients had undergone electrical cardioversion for restoring sinus rhythm which was successful in 12 patients. Ninety-two patients had sinus rhythm when discharged from the hospital. After termination of follow-up, freedom from atrial fibrillation was 51%. Patients with AF during follow-up on surface ECG didn't have episodes of sinus rhythm in their ambulatory monitoring. One patient implanted cardiac pacemaker due to persistent sinus bradycardia. CONCLUSION: Based on the results of this study, Cox Maze III ablation procedure is an effective and safe way for restoring sinus rhythm among patients who are candidate for open heart surgery, while no significant complication was seen among patients.

N2  - Atrial fibrillation (AF) is one of the most common persistent arrhythmias, which has  a close connection to a large number of cardiovascular diseases. However, if spotted early, the diagnosis of AF can improve the effectiveness of clinical treatment and effectively prevent serious complications. In this paper, a combination of an 8-layer convolutional neural network (CNN) with a shortcut connection and 1-layer long short-term memory (LSTM), named 8CSL, was proposed for the Electrocardiogram (ECG) classification task. Compared with recurrent neural networks (RNN) and multi-scale convolution neural networks (MCNN), not only can 8CSL extract features skillfully, but also deal with long-term dependency between data. In particular, 8CSL includes eight shortcut connections that can improve the speed of the data transmission and processing as a result of the shortcut connections. The model was evaluated on the base of the test set of the Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2017 dataset with the F1 score. The ECG recordings were cropped or padded to the same length. After 10-fold cross-validation, the average test F1 score was 84.89%, 89.55%, and 85.64% when the segment length was 5, 10, 20 seconds, respectively. The experiment results demonstrate excellent performance with potential practical applications.

N2  - Detection of sleep apnea using electrocardiographic (ECG) parameters is noninvasive  and inexpensive. Our approach is based on the hypothesis that the patient's sleep-wake cycle during episodes of sleep apnea modulates heart rate (HR) oscillations. These HR oscillations appear as low-frequency fluctuations of instantaneous HR (IHR) and can be detected using HR variability analysis in the frequency domain. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of our ECG-based algorithm for sleep apnea detection and quantification. The algorithm first detects normal QRS complexes and R-R intervals used to derive IHR and to estimate its spectral power in several frequency ranges. A quadratic classifier, trained on the learning set, uses 2 parameters to classify the 1-minute epoch in the middle of each 6-minute window as either apneic or normal. The windows are advanced by 1-minute steps, and the classification process is repeated. As a measure of quantification, the algorithm correctly classified 84.7% of all the 1-minute epochs in the evaluation database; and as a measure of the accuracy of apnea classification, the algorithm correctly classified all 30 test recordings in the evaluation database either as apneic or normal. Our sleep apnea detection algorithm based on analysis of a single-lead ECG provides accurate apnea detection and quantification. Because of its noninvasive and low-cost nature, this algorithm has the potential for numerous applications in sleep medicine.

N2  - This study proposes a robust similarity score-based time series feature extraction  method that is termed as Window-based Time series Feature ExtraCtion (WTC). Specifically, WTC generates domain-interpretable results and involves significantly low computational complexity thereby rendering itself useful for densely sampled and populated time series datasets. In this study, WTC is applied to a proprietary action potential (AP) time series dataset on human cardiomyocytes and three precordial leads from a publicly available electrocardiogram (ECG) dataset. This is followed by comparing WTC in terms of predictive accuracy and computational complexity with shapelet transform and fast shapelet transform (which constitutes an accelerated variant of the shapelet transform). The results indicate that WTC achieves a slightly higher classification performance with significantly lower execution time when compared to its shapelet-based alternatives. With respect to its interpretable features, WTC has a potential to enable medical experts to explore definitive common trends in novel datasets.

N2  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficiency of a new automatic  image processing technique, based on nonlinear dimensionality reduction (NLDR) to separate a cardiac cycle and also detect end-diastole (ED) (cardiac cycle start) and end-systole (ES) frames on an echocardiography system without using ECG. METHODS: Isometric feature mapping (Isomap) and locally linear embeddings (LLE) are the most popular NLDR algorithms. First, Isomap algorithm is applied on recorded echocardiography images. By this approach, the nonlinear embedded information in sequential images is represented in a two-dimensional manifold and each image is characterized by a symbol on the constructed manifold. Cyclicity analysis of the resultant manifold, which is derived from the cyclic nature of the heart motion, is used to perform cardiac cycle length estimation. Then, LLE algorithm is applied on extracted left ventricle (LV) echocardiography images of one cardiac cycle. Finally, the relationship between consecutive symbols of the resultant manifold by the LLE algorithm, which is based on LV volume changes, is used to estimate ED (cycle start) and ES frames. The proposed algorithms are quantitatively compared to those obtained by a highly experienced echocardiographer from ECG as a reference in 20 healthy volunteers and 12 subjects with pathology. RESULTS: Mean difference in cardiac cycle length, ED, and ES frame estimation between our method and ECG detection by the experienced echocardiographer is approximately 7, 17, and 17 ms (0.4, 1, and 1 frame), respectively. CONCLUSION: The proposed image-based method, based on NLDR, can be used as a useful tool for estimation of cardiac cycle length, ED and ES frames in echocardiography systems, with good agreement to ECG assessment by an experienced echocardiographer in routine clinical evaluation.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Automatic measurement becomes a preference, and indeed a necessity, when  analyzing 1000 s of ECGs in the setting of either drug-inducing QT prolongation screening or genome-wide association studies of QT interval. The problem is that individual manufacturers apply different computerized algorithms to measure QT interval. We conducted a comparative study to assess the outcomes with different automated measurements of QT interval between ECG machine manufacturers and validated the related heart rate correction methods. METHODS AND RESULTS: Herein, we directly compared these different commercial systems using 10,529 Fukuda Denshi ECGs and 72,754 Nihon Kohden ECGs taken in healthy Japanese volunteers. Log-transformed data revealed an equal optimal heart rate correction formula of QT interval for Fukuda Denshi and Nihon Kohden, in the form of QTc = QT/RR(-0.347). However, with the raw data, the optimal heart rate correction formula of QT interval was in the form of QTc = QT+0.156×(1-RR) for Fukuda Denshi and QTc = QT+0.152×(1-RR) for Nihon Kohden. After optimization of heart rate correction of QT interval by the linear regression model using either log-transformed data or raw data, QTc interval was ∼10 ms longer in Nihon Kohden ECGs than in those recorded on Fukuda Denshi machines. Indeed, regression analysis revealed that differences in the ECG machine used had up to a two-fold larger impact on QT variation than gender difference. Such an impact is likely to be of considerable importance when ECGs for a given individual are recorded on different machines in the setting of multi-institutional joint research. CONCLUSIONS: We recommend that ECG machines of the same manufacturer should be used to measure QT and RR intervals in the setting of multi-institutional joint research. It is desirable to unify the computer algorithm for automatic QT and RR measurements from an ECG.

N2  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this quality improvement project was to facilitate a  sustainable improvement in the accuracy of cardiac electrode placement for continuous bedside monitoring in intensive care unit patients. BACKGROUND: Continuous cardiac electrocardiograph monitoring is a standard of practice in critical care areas and is essential to accurate interpretation of cardiac dysrhythmias and early detection of myocardial ischemia. Accurate assessment of electrocardiographs depends on precise placement of electrodes; however, electrodes are often placed inaccurately. RATIONALE: Evaluation of baseline practice revealed that cardiac electrodes were placed correctly in only 12.5% of patients. The most frequently misplaced electrode was the V lead, followed by lower limb leads. DESCRIPTION: This project was conducted between July 1, 2013, and October 31, 2013, and involved a multifaceted education program for registered nurse and patient care technician staff on the physiologic basis and technical procedures for cardiac electrode placement. The clinical nurse specialist served as an informal leader, role model, and mentor by developing and empowering unit champions to perform real-time auditing and provide real-time feedback to colleagues. OUTCOME: At 3 months after intervention, the accuracy of cardiac electrode placement was sustained at greater than 85%, representing a 6-fold improvement above the preintervention baseline. CONCLUSION: Sustainable improvement in quality requires creation of a culture that supports quality improvement initiatives. As experts in clinical practice, evidence-based practice, and leadership, clinical nurse specialists are optimally positioned to function as change agents whose initiatives measurably improve outcomes. IMPLICATIONS: This quality improvement project serves as a model for improving accuracy of cardiac electrode placement at the nursing staff level. Future research is necessary to improve outcomes related to accuracy of cardiac electrode placement on the patient and systems levels.

N2  - Occult hemorrhage in surgical/trauma intensive care unit (STICU) patients is common  and may lead to circulatory collapse. Continuous electrocardiography (ECG) monitoring may allow for early identification and treatment, and could improve outcomes. We studied 4,259 consecutive admissions to the STICU at the University of Virginia Health System. We collected ECG waveform data captured by bedside monitors and calculated linear and non-linear measures of the RR interbeat intervals. We tested the hypothesis that a transfusion requirement of 3 or more PRBC transfusions in a 24 hour period is preceded by dynamical changes in these heart rate measures and performed logistic regression modeling. We identified 308 hemorrhage events. A multivariate model including heart rate, standard deviation of the RR intervals, detrended fluctuation analysis, and local dynamics density had a C-statistic of 0.62. Earlier detection of hemorrhage might improve outcomes by allowing earlier resuscitation in STICU patients.

N2  - Interference of monitored electrocardiogram (ECG) is a common event in intensive  care units and operation theaters. Artifacts in the ECG tracing can resemble serious arrhythmia, thus leading to unnecessary usage of antiarrhythmics or electrical defibrillation. In addition, ECG artifacts may lead to serious hemodynamic consequences secondary to intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) trigger failure. We report a rare event of IABP failure due to ECG artifact, which appeared on placement of the transthoracic echocardiography probe over the chest. Subsequent evaluation revealed potential current leakage from echocardiography machine secondary to earthing defect in the machine.

N2  - CONTEXT: Medications commonly used for symptom control along with other known risk  factors have the potential to prolong ventricular repolarization as measured by the QT interval (the time from the start of the Q wave to the end of the T wave) on a standard electrocardiogram (ECG). OBJECTIVES: To document the prevalence of a prolonged QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTc) interval in the palliative/oncology setting, compare automatic ECG QTc measurements with manual readings and identify any correlation between QTc prolongation and the use of drugs or other risk factors. METHODS: A convenience sample of consecutive patients with cancer, admitted under or known to the palliative/supportive care teams in two metropolitan hospitals, and willing to provide an ECG recording and basic demographic information including QTc risk factors were included. Both automated and manually calculated QTc intervals were recorded. Multivariable analysis was used to determine risk factors independently associated with prolonged QTc intervals. RESULTS: Of the 389 participants, there was a significant difference in mean QTc between sites using automated but not manual calculations. Manual readings were therefore used with predetermined cutoffs of 0.44 seconds (males) and 0.46 seconds (females). Seventy-two (18.5%) of the participants had a prolonged QTc with six (1.5%) having a prolongation of >0.50 seconds. At-risk drugs were being taken by 218 participants (56.0% of total cohort). Factors shown to be associated with QTc prolongation included age, gender, performance status, and hypocalcemia. No specific medication was associated with increased risk. CONCLUSION: Although almost 20% of patients receiving palliative care had prolongation of QTc, the possibility of serious consequences appeared to be low despite the frequent occurrence of risk factors.

N2  - Beat-to-beat variability of arterial pressure and heart period (R-R) was studied in  eight conscious freely-moving adult male rats in which telemetric recordings of arterial pressure, ECG and respiratory movements were obtained under unrestrained and unstressed conditions. The beat-to-beat time series of these signals (systolic arterial pressure, diastolic arterial pressure and R-R) were analyzed, in the frequency domain, using autoregressive spectral analysis in order to detect and quantify the rhythmic components. In basal conditions, the systolic arterial pressure variability spectrum was characterized by three major spectral components which had central frequencies respectively of 0.08 +/- 0.03 Hz (very low frequency), 0.43 +/- 0.02 Hz (low frequency) and 1.36 +/- 0.19 Hz (high frequency). Similar rhythmic components were found in R-R signal variability. The very low frequency component included a higher percentage of total power in R-R variability spectrum (75.3%) than in systolic arterial pressure variability spectrum (58.4%). The low frequency component was more pronounced in both systolic and diastolic arterial pressure variability spectra. The high frequency component of R-R, systolic and diastolic arterial pressure was synchronous with respiration. Cross-spectral analysis revealed a high statistical coherence between R-R and arterial pressure variabilities in all the three frequency bands. An alpha-adrenergic blocker (phentolamine) specifically abolished the low frequency components of systolic and diastolic arterial pressure variability spectra, thus suggesting that low frequency is a marker of sympathetic modulation of vasomotor activity. The low frequency component of R-R variability spectrum was also markedly blunted. We suggest that cardiovascular variability signals, (R-R, systolic and diastolic arterial pressure) are composed almost of two main rhythms linked to respiration and vasomotor activity. These rhythms can be quantified in conscious unrestrained rats by using telemetry and spectral analysis. This approach seems to offer a new powerful tool for pharmacological studies in conscious small animals.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Patients admitted into a medical Intensive Care Unit (ICU) have  varying illnesses and risk factors. An electrocardiogram (ECG) is a useful tool to assess the cardiac status. The aim of the study was to determine the prevalence of QT prolongation of the ECG in patients admitted to a medical ICU in a tertiary hospital, to assess outcomes in terms of mortality, cardiovascular events, and duration of ICU stay. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Prospective observational study, 6 months duration, assessing the prevalence of prolonged corrected QT interval (QTc) at admission into a medical ICU. A QTc calculated by Bazett's formula, of >440 ms for males and >460 ms for females was considered prolonged. Details of illness, clinical and lab parameters were monitored. RESULTS: The total number of patients screened was 182. There was a high prevalence of prolonged QTc (30%) on admission to the ICU. This reduced to 19% on day 3 (P = 0.011). In patients with a prolonged QTc the odds ratio of adverse outcome from ICU was 3.17 (confidence interval [CI]: 1.52-6.63) (P = 0.001) and of adverse outcome for hospital stay was 2.27 (CI: 1.11-4.66) (P = 0.014). In the study, 35% of all patients received drugs with QT prolonging action. Of patients with a prolonged QTc at admission 18 (35%) received a QT prolonging drug. CONCLUSIONS: We found that prolonged QTc is common (30%) in our medical ICU at admission and a large proportion (35%) received drugs capable of prolonging QT interval. These patients with QTc prolongation have a higher odds ratio for adverse outcomes.

N2  - It is often advised that patients who have ingested an overdose of antidepressants  (AD) or antipsychotics (AP) are monitored with continuous ECG for minimum of 12-24 hr. These patients are often observed in an ICU. Our aim was to identify the number of patients with AD and/or AP overdose without adverse signs at hospital admission that turned out to need intensive care treatment. The effect of the antidepressants overdose risk assessment (ADORA) system was evaluated in patients with antidepressant as well as antipsychotic overdose. Our hypothesis was that patients with low ADORA do not need intensive care treatment. This retrospective study was conducted in adult patients admitted to the ICU at Odense University Hospital after an overdose with AP and/or AD between 1 January 2009 and 1 September 2014. Patients with predefined adverse signs in the emergency department were excluded due to obvious need of intensive care. Of the 157 patients included, 12 patients (8%) developed events during the ICU stay. Only 3 patients received intubation, vasoactive drugs and/or dialysis. None developed ventricular dysrhythmias. There were no fatalities. All the patients with low-risk assessment by ADORA within the first 6 hr did not develop events within the first 24 hr after hospital admission. The vast majority of patients with AD and/or AP overdose and no adverse signs at admission did not require intensive care treatment. Low-risk ADORA identified patients with antidepressant as well as antipsychotic overdose who would not require initial intensive care treatment. This is the first time the ADORA system has been evaluated in patients with antidepressant as well as antipsychotic overdose.

N2  - Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmias causing morbidity  and mortality. AF may appear as episodes of very short (i.e., proximal AF) or sustained duration (i.e., persistent AF), either form of which causes irregular ventricular excitations that affect the global function of the heart. It is an unmet challenge for early and automatic detection of AF, limiting efficient treatment strategies for AF. In this study, we developed a new method based on continuous wavelet transform and 2D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to detect AF episodes. The proposed method analyzed the time-frequency features of the electrocardiogram (ECG), thus being different to conventional AF detecting methods that implement isolating atrial or ventricular activities. Then a 2D CNN was trained to improve AF detection performance. The MIT-BIH Atrial Fibrillation Database was used for evaluating the algorithm. The efficacy of the proposed method was compared with those of some existing methods, most of which implemented the same dataset. The newly developed algorithm using CNNs achieved 99.41, 98.91, 99.39, and 99.23% for the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and overall accuracy (ACC) respectively. As the proposed algorithm targets the time-frequency feature of ECG signals rather than isolated atrial or ventricular activity, it has the ability to detect AF episodes for using just five beats, suggesting practical applications in the future.

N2  - In this paper we employed a novel approach based on joint symbolic dynamics (JSD) to  study interaction between respiratory phase and baroreflex activity. Electrocardiogram (ECG) and blood pressure recordings from six participants with history of heart failure were included in this study. First, the ECG R-peaks and systolic blood pressure indices were detected using parabolic fitting. Second, the respiratory signal was derived from Frank orthogonal ECG leads using QRS slopes and R-wave angles. Third, time series of R-R intervals and systolic blood pressure (SBP) were extracted, and respiratory phases were obtained using the Hilbert transform. Subsequently, each series was transformed into binary symbol vectors based on their successive changes and words of length '2' were formed. Baroreflex patterns were studied using word combinations representing baroreflex activity for specific changes in respiratory phases. Baroreflex activity was significantly higher for alternating low-high/high-low heart rate and SBP during inspiration as compared to continuous increase or decrease in heart rate and SBP ([Formula: see text], w(RP)=11: 39.1±9.3% vs. [Formula: see text], w(RP)=11: 6.4±3.9%, p<0.0001).

N2  - BACKGROUND: The main ECG criteria for the diagnosis of long-QT syndrome (LQTS)  include abnormal T-wave morphology as well as prolonged QT interval. The T wave in LQTS probably includes additional components of the myocardial repolarization process, which are derived from aberrant ion currents. We investigated whether independent component analysis (ICA) can extract such abnormal repolarization components. METHODS AND RESULTS: Digital ECG data were obtained as a time series from 10 channels using 20 surface electrodes in 22 patients with genetically confirmed LQTS type 1 (LQT1) and 30 normal subjects. In each case, T-wave area was analyzed by radical ICA after noise reduction by the wavelet thresholding method. Furthermore, inverse ICA was applied to determine the origin of each independent component (IC). Radical ICA revealed that a T-wave consisted of 4 basic ICs in all control subjects, whereas ≥ 5 (mostly 6) ICs were identified in all 22 patients with LQT1. The extra ICs, which were not evident in normal subjects, were assumed to contribute to the formation of abnormal T-wave morphology. The extra ICs were identified even in patients with normal QTc values and in those taking β-blockers. Inverse ICA indicated that the additional ICs originate predominantly from the late phase of the T wave of the left ventricle. CONCLUSIONS: Extra ICs appear during repolarization in all patients with LQT1 but not in normal subjects. ICA is a potentially useful multivariate statistical method to differentiate patients with LQT1 from normal subjects.

N2  - The time course and concentration-effect relationship of parasympatholytic effects  of three anticholinergic drugs were investigated using spectral analysis of heart rate (HR) variability. Single intravenous (i.v.) doses of atropine (10 microg/kg), glycopyrrolate (5 microg/kg), scopolamine (5 microg/kg), and placebo were given to eight healthy volunteers in a double-blind, randomized cross-over study. Electrocardiogram (ECG) was recorded at baseline and 2.5, 5, 10, 20, and 30 minutes, and 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 hours after drug administration, while the subjects breathed at a fixed 0.25 Hz frequency. The powers of two frequency bands (low frequency [LF] = 0.07-0.15 Hz and high frequency [HF] = 0.15-0.40 Hz) were calculated using stationary time series of R-R intervals (RRI) free from ectopic beats. To perform pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) modeling, venous plasma drug concentrations were measured. Atropine and glycopyrrolate, and, to a lesser extent, scopolamine induced decreases in HF power and increases in LF/HF ratio of HR variability, indicating parasympatholytic activity and corresponding changes in sympathovagal balance. Maximal average decreases in HF power were 99%, 94%, and 82%, respectively, but in two scopolamine subjects, a parasympathomimetic effect was dominant. Interindividual variability was least for the Hayano index of HF power (square root (RRI HF-power)/RRI*100), and profound and consistent decreases were seen after atropine and glycopyrrolate. Pharmacokinetics were best fitted to a two-compartment open model, and effect compartment link modeling using the Hayano index was performed with the atropine and glycopyrrolate data. The best description of the PK-PD relationship for both drugs was achieved using the sigmoidal Emax model. Mean (+/-SD) EC50, sigmoidicity factor (gamma), and equilibration rate constant (k(e0)) estimates were 1.35 (+/-0.27) ng/mL, 6.07 (+/-1.98) and 11.0 (+/-5.28) l/h for atropine and 1.35 (+/-0.49) ng/mL, 4.34 (+/-1.55) and 2.26 (+/-0.81) l/h for glycopyrrolate. Spectral analysis of HR variability appears to be a powerful tool in monitoring parasympatholytic drug activity. A sigmoidal Emax model with an extremely steep concentration-response relationship was revealed for atropine and glycopyrrolate. The effects of scopolamine were more incongruous.

N2  - The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a biophysical electric signal generated by the heart  muscle, and is one of the major measurements of how well a heart functions. Automatic ECG analysis algorithms usually extract the geometric or frequency-domain features of the ECG signals and have already significantly facilitated automatic ECG-based cardiac disease diagnosis. We propose a novel ECG feature by fitting a given ECG signal with a 20th order polynomial function, defined as PolyECG-S. The PolyECG-S feature is almost identical to the fitted ECG curve, measured by the Akaike information criterion (AIC), and achieved a 94.4% accuracy in detecting the Myocardial Infarction (MI) on the test dataset. Currently ST segment elongation is one of the major ways to detect MI (ST-elevation myocardial infarction, STEMI). However, many ECG signals have weak or even undetectable ST segments. Since PolyECG-S does not rely on the information of ST waves, it can be used as a complementary MI detection algorithm with the STEMI strategy. Overall, our results suggest that the PolyECG-S feature may satisfactorily reconstruct the fitted ECG curve, and is complementary to the existing ECG features for automatic cardiac function analysis.

N2  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to validate the clinical usefulness of  Advanced Patient Motion Correction (APMC) reconstruction when motion artifacts were observed in a prospective ECG-gated coronary CT angiography (CCTA), which was acquired by low tube current scanning with full reconstruction using 320-row area detector CT (0.275 s/rot.). METHODS: Of 530 consecutive CCTA, we selected 119 patients (M/F: 71/48, Age: 69 ± 11 y, BMI: 23.5 ± 2.5) with (RR-PQ) ≥ 968 ms before scanning, and performed a CCTA with low tube current scanning [30% of usual tube current (30%mA)], adaptive iterative dose reduction 3D, and full reconstruction. Image quality for motion artifacts was subjectively evaluated using a 3-point scale (excellent, acceptable, and unacceptable). RESULTS: Of 119, 102 CCTA had "excellent" images (group A) and 17 had "acceptable" images (group B). The APMC and half reconstruction were retried in the 17 CCTA with "acceptable" images. Finally, all CCTA became "excellent" images. The RR-PQ of group B during scanning (966 ± 80 ms) was significantly (P = 0.0001) shorter than group A (1,088 ± 123 ms). Each image noise (standard deviation of CT value) of aorta, left atrium, and left ventricle was 21.7 ± 2.3, 24.7 ± 2.3, 24.5 ± 2.4 in full, 25.7 ± 2.2, 29.0 ± 3.4, 28.2 ± 2.7 in APMC, and 30.4 ± 2.8, 34.3 ± 4.2, 33.3 ± 2.9 HU in half reconstruction. Mean dose-length product of all patients was 66.2 ± 34.4 mGy · cm. CONCLUSION: "Excellent" CCTA images can be obtained in 85.7% of patients with (RR-PQ)≥ 968 ms by full reconstruction. APMC is useful for motion artifacts and image noise reduction when patient' s HR increases during scanning rather than half reconstruction.

N2  - Manual processing of sleep recordings is extremely time-consuming. Efforts to  automate this process have shown promising results, but automatic systems are generally evaluated on private databases, not allowing accurate cross-validation with other systems. In lacking a common benchmark, the relative performances of different systems are not compared easily and advances are compromised. To address this fundamental methodological impediment to sleep study, we propose an open-access database of polysomnographic biosignals. To build this database, whole-night recordings from 200 participants [97 males (aged 42.9 ± 19.8 years) and 103 females (aged 38.3 ± 18.9 years); age range: 18-76 years] were pooled from eight different research protocols performed in three different hospital-based sleep laboratories. All recordings feature a sampling frequency of 256 Hz and an electroencephalography (EEG) montage of 4-20 channels plus standard electro-oculography (EOG), electromyography (EMG), electrocardiography (ECG) and respiratory signals. Access to the database can be obtained through the Montreal Archive of Sleep Studies (MASS) website (http://www.ceams-carsm.ca/en/MASS), and requires only affiliation with a research institution and prior approval by the applicant's local ethical review board. Providing the research community with access to this free and open sleep database is expected to facilitate the development and cross-validation of sleep analysis automation systems. It is also expected that such a shared resource will be a catalyst for cross-centre collaborations on difficult topics such as improving inter-rater agreement on sleep stage scoring.

N2  - PURPOSE: The highest photon fluence rate that a computed tomography (CT) detector  must be able to measure is an important parameter. The authors calculate the maximum transmitted fluence rate in a commercial CT scanner as a function of patient size for standard head, chest, and abdomen protocols. METHODS: The authors scanned an anthropomorphic phantom (Kyoto Kagaku PBU-60) with the reference CT protocols provided by AAPM on a GE LightSpeed VCT scanner and noted the tube current applied with the tube current modulation (TCM) system. By rescaling this tube current using published measurements on the tube current modulation of a GE scanner [N. Keat, "CT scanner automatic exposure control systems," MHRA Evaluation Report 05016, ImPACT, London, UK, 2005], the authors could estimate the tube current that these protocols would have resulted in for other patient sizes. An ECG gated chest protocol was also simulated. Using measured dose rate profiles along the bowtie filters, the authors simulated imaging of anonymized patient images with a range of sizes on a GE VCT scanner and calculated the maximum transmitted fluence rate. In addition, the 99th and the 95th percentiles of the transmitted fluence rate distribution behind the patient are calculated and the effect of omitting projection lines passing just below the skin line is investigated. RESULTS: The highest transmitted fluence rates on the detector for the AAPM reference protocols with centered patients are found for head images and for intermediate-sized chest images, both with a maximum of 3.4 ⋅ 10(8) mm(-2) s(-1), at 949 mm distance from the source. Miscentering the head by 50 mm downward increases the maximum transmitted fluence rate to 5.7 ⋅ 10(8) mm(-2) s(-1). The ECG gated chest protocol gives fluence rates up to 2.3 ⋅ 10(8) - 3.6 ⋅ 10(8) mm(-2) s(-1) depending on miscentering. CONCLUSIONS: The fluence rate on a CT detector reaches 3 ⋅ 10(8) - 6 ⋅ 10(8) mm(-2) s(-1) in standard imaging protocols, with the highest rates occurring for ECG gated chest and miscentered head scans. These results will be useful to developers of CT detectors, in particular photon counting detectors.

N2  - Hypertension (HPT), also known as high blood pressure, is a precursor to heart,  brain or kidney diseases. Some symptoms of HPT include headaches, dizziness and fainting. The potential diagnosis of masked hypertension is of specific interest in this study. In masked hypertension (MHPT), the instantaneous blood pressure appears normal, but the 24-h ambulatory blood pressure is abnormal. Hence patients with MHPT are difficult to identify and thus remain untreated or are treated insufficiently. Hence, a computational intelligence tool (CIT) using electrocardiograms (ECG) signals for HPT and possible MHPT detection is proposed in this work. Empirical mode decomposition (EMD) is employed to decompose the pre-processed signals up to five levels. Nonlinear features are extracted from the five intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) thereafter. Student's t-test is subsequently applied to select a set of highly discriminatory features. This feature set is then input to various classifiers, in which, the best accuracy of 97.70% is yielded by the k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) classifier. The developed tool is evaluated by the 10-fold cross validation technique. Our findings suggest that the developed system is useful for diagnostic computational intelligence tool in hospital settings, and that it enables the automatic classification of HPT versus normal ECG signals.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Reports of cardiac arrhythmias and cardiac pathology at postmortem  examination of patients with epilepsy suggest a possible cardiac component of risk for sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). T-wave alternans (TWA) is an established marker of cardiac electrical instability and risk for sudden death in patients with cardiovascular disease. We determined the TWA level before vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) system implantation and subsequently the effect of VNS on TWA in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. METHODS: Patients (n=28) from the Seizure Detection and Automatic Magnet Mode Performance Study (E-36), a clinical trial of the AspireSR® VNS Therapy System® (NCT01325623), were monitored with ambulatory electrocardiograms (ECGs) ~2weeks before de novo VNS system implantation and following 2- to 4-week VNS titration during a protocol-specified 3- to 5-day epilepsy monitoring unit stay with concurrent EEG/ECG recordings. The TWA level was assessed interictally by the Modified Moving Average (MMA) method. RESULTS: At preimplantation baseline, TWA was elevated above the 47-μV abnormality cutpoint in 23 (82%) patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. In 16 (70%) patients, TWA level was reduced during VNS treatment to <47μV, thereby converting positive TWA test results to negative. Peak TWA level in all 28 patients improved (group mean, 43%, from 72±4.3 to 41±2.3μV; p<0.0001). Vagus nerve stimulation was not associated with reduced heart rate (77±1.4 to 75±1.4beats/min; p=0.18). Heart rate variability was unchanged. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings suggest significant interictal cardiac electrical instability in this population of patients with drug-resistant epilepsy and suggest that VNS may be a novel approach to reducing risk.

N2  - This paper describes an automatic classification system based on combination of  diverse features for the purpose of automatic heartbeat recognition. The method consists of three stages. At the first stage, heartbeats are classified into 5 main groups defined by AAMI using optimal feature sets for each main group. At the second stage, main groups are classified into subgroups using optimal features for each subgroup. Then the third stage is added to the system for classifying beats that are labeled as unclassified beats in the first two classification stages. A diverse set of features including higher order statistics, morphological features, Fourier transform coefficients, and higher order statistics of the wavelet package coefficients are extracted for each different type of ECG beat. At the first stage, optimal features for main groups are determined by using a wrapper type feature selection algorithm. At the second stage, optimal features are similarly selected for discriminating each subgroup of the main groups. Then at the third stage, only raw data is used for classifying beats. In all stages, the classifiers are based on the k-nearest neighbor algorithm. ECG records used in this study are obtained from the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database. The classification accuracy of the proposed system is measured by sensitivity, selectivity, and specificity measures. The system is classified 16 heartbeat types. The measures of proposed system are 85.59%, 95.46%, and 99.56%, for average sensitivity, average selectivity, and average specificity, respectively.

N2  - Biosignals are usually contaminated with artifacts from limb movements, muscular  contraction or electrical interference. Many algorithms of the literature, such as threshold methods and adaptive filters, focus on detecting these noisy patterns. This study introduces a novel method for noise and artifact detection in electrocardiogram based on time series clustering. The algorithm starts with the extraction of features that best characterize the shape and behaviour of the signal over time and groups its samples in separated clusters by means of an agglomerative clustering approach. The method has been tested in numerous datasets to reveal that it is independent on specific records and globally, the algorithm was able to successfully detect noisy patterns and artifacts with a sensitivity of 88%, a specificity of 92% and an accuracy of 91%, demonstrating a good performance in pattern detection based on morphological clustering. This algorithm can be applied to the detection and sectioning of multiple types of noise for more accurate denoising and adapted for signal classification.

N2  - The automatic computation of the hypnogram and sleep Parameters, from the data  acquired with portable sensors, is a challenging problem with important clinical applications. In this paper, the hypnogram, the sleep efficiency (SE), rapid eye movement (REM), and nonREM (NREM) sleep percentages are automatically estimated from physiological (ECG and respiration) and behavioral (Actigraphy) nocturnal data. Two methods are described; the first deals with the problem of the hypnogram estimation and the second is specifically designed to compute the sleep parameters, outperforming the traditional estimation approach based on the hypnogram. Using an extended set of features the first method achieves an accuracy of 72.8%, 77.4%, and 80.3% in the detection of wakefulness, REM, and NREM states, respectively, and the second an estimation error of 4.3%, 9.8%, and 5.4% for the SE, REM, and NREM percentages, respectively.

N2  - The main purpose of this paper is to study the influence of the mechanical effect of  respiration over the T-wave end delineation. We compared the performance of an automatic delineation system based on the wavelet transform (WT), considering single lead (SL), global delineation locations obtained from SL annotations (SLR), and multilead (ML) approaches. The linear relation between the variations on T-wave end locations obtained with each of the methods and the mechanical effect of respiration was quantified using spectral coherence and ARARX modeling both in simulated signals and in real data. We also explored the evolution of the vectorcardiographic spatial loop using the projection on the main direction of the WT in the region close to the T-wave end ( T(e)) and its relation with respiration. The dispersion of the additional T-wave end location error due to respiration was reduced by 15% using SLR with respect to SL, while ML allows for a reduction of around 40%. The percentage of that error correlated with respiration was in average 99% using SL while 82% and 72% using SLR and ML, respectively. Thus, results suggest that ML is the most adequate strategy for T-wave delineation, allowing the reduction of the instability of T-wave end location caused by respiration.

N2  - Objective: Seizure-related autonomic dysregulation occurs in epilepsy patients and  may contribute to Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP). We tested how different types of seizures affect baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) and heart rate variability (HRV). We hypothesized that BRS and HRV would be reduced after bilateral convulsive seizures (BCS). Methods: We recorded blood pressure (BP), electrocardiogram (ECG) and oxygen saturation continuously in patients (n = 18) with intractable epilepsy undergoing video-EEG monitoring. A total of 23 seizures, either focal seizures (FS, n = 14) or BCS (n = 9), were analyzed from these patients. We used 5 different HRV measurements in both the time and frequency domains to study HRV in pre- and post-ictal states. We used the average frequency domain gain, computed as the average of the magnitude ratio between the systolic BP (BPsys) and the RR-interval time series, in the low-frequency (LF) band as frequency domain index of BRS in addition to the instantaneous slope between systolic BP and RR-interval satisfying spontaneous BRS criteria as a time domain index of BRS. Results: Overall, the post-ictal modulation of HRV varied across the subjects but not specifically by the type of seizures. Comparing pre- to post-ictal epochs, the LF power of BRS decreased in 8 of 9 seizures for patients with BCS; whereas following 12 of 14 FS, BRS increased. Similarly, spontaneous BRS decreased following 7 of 9 BCS. The presence or absence of oxygen desaturation was not consistent with the changes in BRS following seizures, and the HRV does not appear to be correlated with the BRS changes. These data suggest that a transient decrease in BRS and temporary loss of cardiovascular homeostatic control can follow BCS but is unlikely following FS. Significance: These findings indicate significant post-ictal autonomic dysregulation in patients with epilepsy following BCS. Further, reduced BRS following BCS, if confirmed in future studies on SUDEP cases, may indicate one quantifiable risk marker of SUDEP.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Sleep Apnea Syndrome (SAS) is a common sleep-related breathing disorder,  which affects about 4-7% males and 2-4% females all around the world. Different approaches have been adopted to diagnose SAS and measure its severity, including the gold standard Polysomnography (PSG) in sleep study field as well as several alternative techniques such as single-channel ECG, pulse oximeter and so on. However, many shortcomings still limit their generalization in home environment. In this study, we aim to propose an efficient approach to automatically assess the severity of sleep apnea syndrome based on the ballistocardiogram (BCG) signal, which is non-intrusive and suitable for in home environment. METHODS: We develop an unobtrusive sleep monitoring system to capture the BCG signals, based on which we put forward a three-stage sleep apnea syndrome severity assessment framework, i.e., data preprocessing, sleep-related breathing events (SBEs) detection, and sleep apnea syndrome severity evaluation. First, in the data preprocessing stage, to overcome the limits of BCG signals (e.g., low precision and reliability), we utilize wavelet decomposition to obtain the outline information of heartbeats, and apply a RR correction algorithm to handle missing or spurious RR intervals. Afterwards, in the event detection stage, we propose an automatic sleep-related breathing event detection algorithm named Physio_ICSS based on the iterative cumulative sums of squares (i.e., the ICSS algorithm), which is originally used to detect structural breakpoints in a time series. In particular, to efficiently detect sleep-related breathing events in the obtained time series of RR intervals, the proposed algorithm not only explores the practical factors of sleep-related breathing events (e.g., the limit of lasting duration and possible occurrence sleep stages) but also overcomes the event segmentation issue (e.g., equal-length segmentation method might divide one sleep-related breathing event into different fragments and lead to incorrect results) of existing approaches. Finally, by fusing features extracted from multiple domains, we can identify sleep-related breathing events and assess the severity level of sleep apnea syndrome effectively. CONCLUSIONS: Experimental results on 136 individuals of different sleep apnea syndrome severities validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, with the accuracy of 94.12% (128/136).

N2  - OBJECTIVES: Signal analysis has played an important role in cardiac diagnosis, both  as a separate entity and in conjunction with clinical parameters. Hybrid systems are an effective method for developing higher-order decision models in which biomedical signal data can be incorporated. METHODS: The hybrid system components include a knowledge-based system that utilizes approximate reasoning techniques, a neural network model based on a potential function approach to supervised learning that uses the general class of Cohen orthogonal functions as potential functions, and a signal analysis component that relies on continuous chaotic modeling to produce a degree of variability in the time series. The hybrid system is illustrated in an application for differentiation among different types of dementia. RESULTS: Application of this method to cardiac diagnosis shows that chaotic parameters alone contribute significantly to correct classification while the addition of clinical parameters increases the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. Applications to electroencephalogram analysis indicate that the second-order difference plots display significant differences for the different types of EEG waves identifiable by frequency, both in shape and degree of dispersion. Hence the identification of these waves, and the duration of their occurrence, may provide suitable variables for chaotic analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Results from studies in cardiology demonstrate that using chaotic measures for ECG analysis provide useful information for classification. Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy are increased if these methods are combined with other clinical parameters in a hybrid system. This approach has been extended to new applications based on EEG analysis combined with other relevant information.

N2  - The main role of ambulatory electrocardiography (AECG) in clinical practice is to  detect and characterize the behavior of cardiac electrical activity during ordinary daily life activities. Because certain rhythm abnormalities may be infrequent and paroxysmal, and may occur only during sleep or in association with mental, emotional, or exercise-induced perturbation in cardiac function, AECG needs to be recorded over a long period of time, originally lasting 24h and now expanding up to several weeks and even to months. New technologies for continuous prolonged AECG monitoring, and new algorithms for automatic arrhythmia detection and wireless data transmission in near real-time, have significantly improved the ECG signals quality for long-term recordings and the diagnostic yield for infrequent cardiac arrhythmias. New wireless electrode systems, such as patches, vests or belts have greatly increased the tolerability, quality and feasibility of prolonged AECG, which is particularly useful for the diagnosis of infrequent symptoms, such as unexplained syncope, palpitations or cryptogenic stroke.

N2  - This work introduces a new single-lead ECG delineator based on phasor transform. The  method is characterized by its robustness, low computational cost and mathematical simplicity. It converts each instantaneous ECG sample into a phasor, and can precisely manage P and T waves, which are of notably lower amplitude than the QRS complex. The method has been validated making use of synthesized and real ECG sets, including the MIT-BIH arrhythmia, QT, European ST-T and TWA Challenge 2008 databases. Experiments with the synthesized recordings reported precise detection and delineation performances in a wide variety of ECGs, with signal-to-noise ratios of 10 dB and above. For real ECGs, the QRS detection was characterized by an average sensitivity of 99.81% and positive predictivity of 99.89%, for all the analyzed databases (more than one million beats). Regarding delineation, the maximum localization error between automatic and manual annotations was lower than 6 ms and its standard deviation was in agreement with the accepted tolerances for expert physicians in the onset and offset identification for QRS, P and T waves. Furthermore, after revising and reannotating some ECG recordings by expert cardiologists, the delineation error decreased notably, becoming lower than 3.5 ms, on average, and reducing by a half its standard deviation. This new proposed strategy outperforms the results provided by other well-known delineation algorithms and, moreover, presents a notably lower computational cost.

N2  - We construct temporal networks from time series via unfolding the temporal  information into an additional topological dimension of the networks. Thus, we are able to introduce memory entropy analysis to unravel the memory effect within the considered signal. We find distinct patterns in the entropy growth rate of the aggregate network at different memory scales for time series with different dynamics ranging from white noise, 1/f noise, autoregressive process, periodic to chaotic dynamics. Interestingly, for a chaotic time series, an exponential scaling emerges in the memory entropy analysis. We demonstrate that the memory exponent can successfully characterize bifurcation phenomenon, and differentiate the human cardiac system in healthy and pathological states. Moreover, we show that the betweenness preference analysis of these temporal networks can further characterize dynamical systems and separate distinct electrocardiogram recordings. Our work explores the memory effect and betweenness preference in temporal networks constructed from time series data, providing a new perspective to understand the underlying dynamical systems.

N2  - The paper deals with ECG prediction based on neural networks classification of  different types of time courses of ECG signals. The main objective is to recognise normal cycles and arrhythmias and perform further diagnosis. We proposed two detection systems that have been created with usage of neural networks. The experimental part makes it possible to load ECG signals, preprocess them, and classify them into given classes. Outputs from the classifiers carry a predictive character. All experimental results from both of the proposed classifiers are mutually compared in the conclusion. We also experimented with the new method of time series transparent prediction based on fuzzy transform with linguistic IF-THEN rules. Preliminary results show interesting results based on the unique capability of this approach bringing natural language interpretation of particular prediction, that is, the properties of time series.

N2  - Accurate and fast approaches for automatic ECG data classification are vital for  clinical diagnosis of heart disease. To this end, we propose a novel multistage algorithm that combines various procedures for dimensionality reduction, consensus clustering of randomized samples and fast supervised classification algorithms for processing of the highly dimensional large ECG datasets. We carried out extensive experiments to study the effectiveness of the proposed multistage clustering and classification scheme using precision, recall and F-measure metrics. We evaluated the performance of numerous combinations of various methods for dimensionality reduction, consensus functions and classification algorithms incorporated in our multistage scheme. The results of the experiments demonstrate that the highest precision, recall and F-measure are achieved by the combination of the rank correlation coefficient for dimensionality reduction, HBGF consensus function and the SMO classifier with the polynomial kernel.

N2  - Heart rate data collected during nonlaboratory conditions present several  data-modeling challenges. First, the noise in such data is often poorly described by a simple Gaussian; it has outliers and errors come in bursts. Second, in large-scale studies the ECG waveform is usually not recorded in full, so one has to deal with missing information. In this paper, we propose a robust postprocessing model for such applications. Our model to infer the latent heart rate time series consists of two main components: unsupervised clustering followed by Bayesian regression. The clustering component uses auxiliary data to learn the structure of outliers and noise bursts. The subsequent Gaussian process regression model uses the cluster assignments as prior information and incorporates expert knowledge about the physiology of the heart. We apply the method to a wide range of heart rate data and obtain convincing predictions along with uncertainty estimates. In a quantitative comparison with existing postprocessing methodology, our model achieves a significant increase in performance.

N2  - This work explored the suitability of using the foetal phonocardiogram (FPCG)  blindly separated from the abdominal phonogram as a source for foetal heart rate (FHR) measuring in antenatal surveillance. To this end, and working on a dataset of 15 abdominal phonograms, the FPCG was estimated by using two de-noising approaches (1) single-channel independent component analysis (SCICA) to produce FPCG(e) and (2) empirical filtering to produce FPCG(g). Next, the FPCGs were further processed to collect the beat-to-beat FHR and the resulting time-series (FCTG(e) and FCTG(g) were compared to the reference signal given by the abdominal ECG (FCTG(r)). Results are promising, the FPCG(e) gives rise to a FCTG(e) that resembles FCTG(r) and, most importantly, whose mean FHR value is statistically equivalent to that given by FCTG(r) (p > 0.05). Thus, the mean FHR value obtained from the FPCG(e), is likely to be equivalent to the value given by the abdominal ECG, which is especially significant since the FPCG(e) is retrieved from the noisy abdominal phonogram. Hence, as far as this study has gone, it can be said that, when using SCICA to de-noise the abdominal phonogram, the resulting FPCG is likely to become a useful source for FHR collection in antenatal surveillance.

N2  - We examined the changes in cardioventilatory synchronisation and breathing frequency  variability that occur during early postnatal development in anaesthetised rats. Five-minute periods of heart rate and inspiratory timing data were recorded from 26 halothane anaesthetised, spontaneously breathing rats aged 2-14 days. The presence of cardioventilatory synchronisation was determined by examining the timing relationship between inspiratory onset and the preceding ECG R waves. We observed synchronisation at all ages, and the degree of synchronisation present (measured as the Shannon entropy of the interval between inspiration and the immediately preceding R wave) did not correlate with age. Frequent apnoeas were observed in the respiratory frequency time series. The duration of these apnoeas was close to either one or two times the duration of the immediately preceding breath. We suggest that these "dropped breaths" may be the consequence of a resetting of the respiratory oscillator just prior to initiation of the breath, or a gating process beneath the oscillator that intermittently blocks the mechanical initiation of breaths. Dropped breaths were seen commonly in rats up to 11 days of age, but rarely in 11-14-day old rats, and were not associated with the presence or absence of cardioventilatory synchronisation.

N2  - Nowadays several diagnostic tools are available to investigate cardiovascular  symptoms like palpitations, dizziness and syncope: ECG Holter (or ambulatory ECG, AECG), external and implantable event/loop recorders. Despite this technological burden, many diagnoses are still missed. In the meantime, we are facing an increasing use of implantable devices for cardiac pacing/defibrillation (CIED), which have rapidly evolved from simple pacing/shock boxes to devices including several diagnostic features. However, these functions are not adequately exploited in current clinical practice and several redundant diagnostic tests, like AECG, are still prescribed to CIED carriers, leading to an increase of costs and a delay in final diagnosis. This review is aimed at identifying the current role of AECG in CIED carriers in view of this technological improvement. First, we will briefly present the indications for AECG according to current guidelines. We will then provide a direct comparison of the different diagnostic features provided by AECG (and event/loop recorders) versus automatic diagnostic CIED to highlight the respective pros and cons. This will serve to carefully discuss these indications in view of the results of recent studies on CIED carriers, highlighting the need for proper implantation and follow-up. Eventually, we will provide useful hints to properly analyse AECG in CIED carriers, considering the different behaviours according to the implemented algorithms. We will conclude by suggesting updated indications for AECG.

N2  - A robust medical monitoring device should be able to provide intelligent diagnosis  based on accurate analysis of physiological parameters in real-time. At the same time, such device must be able to adapt to the characteristics of a specific patient and desired diagnostic needs, and continue to operate even in presence of unexpected artifacts and accidental errors. A reconfigurable architecture is proposed for real-time assessment of individual's health status based on development of a patient-specific health index and online analysis and fusion of multi-parameter physiological signals. This is achieved by static configuration of processing elements and communication blocks in the architecture based on the patient's diagnostic needs. The proposed architecture is prototyped as a single integrated device on an FPGA platform and is evaluated using multi-parameter data from intensive care units (ICUs). Three representative test cases of concurrently analyzing Blood Pressure, Heart Rate, and Electrocardiogram (ECG) data from MIMIC database are presented. The results show the effectiveness of the proposed technique in eliminating false alarms caused by patient movements, monitor noise, or imperfections in the detection schemes.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: To describe the frequency of different physiologic monitoring modalities  and combinations of modalities used during pediatric procedural sedation; to describe how physiologic monitoring varies among different classes of patients, health care providers (ie, ranging from anesthesiologists to emergency medicine physicians to nurse practitioners), procedures, and sedative medications employed; and to determine the proportion of sedations meeting published guidelines for physiologic monitoring. DESIGN This was a prospective, observational study from September 1, 2007, through March 31, 2011. SETTING: Data were collected in areas outside of the operating room, such as intensive care units, radiology, emergency departments, and clinics. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-seven institutions comprise the Pediatric Sedation Research Consortium that prospectively collects data on procedural sedation/anesthesia performed outside of the operating room in all children up to age 21 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Data including demographics, procedure performed, provider level, adverse events, medications, and physiologic monitors used are entered into a web-based system. RESULTS: Data from 114 855 subjects were collected and analyzed. The frequency of use of each physiologic monitoring modality by health care provider type, medication used, and procedure performed varied significantly. The largest difference in frequency of monitoring use was seen between providers using electrocardiography (13%-95%); the smallest overall differences were seen in monitoring use based on the American Society of Anesthesiologists classifications (1%-10%). Guidelines published by the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of Emergency Physicians, and the American Society of Anesthesiologists for nonanesthesiologists were adhered to for 52% of subjects. CONCLUSIONS: A large degree of variability exists in the use of physiologic monitoring modalities for pediatric procedural sedation. Differences in monitoring are evident between sedation providers, medications, procedures, and patient types.

N2  - Dealing with motion artifacts in long-term ECG recordings is a big issue. The  frequency spectrum of motion artifacts is similar to the frequencies of the QRS complex--the wanted signal in the ECG. The deletion of motion artifacts often leads to a deformation of QRS complexes, too. These risks can be minimized by using a noise-correlating signal as a second channel for artifact reduction. This paper presents an approach using the electrode-skin impedance as a second channel for the reduction of motion artifacts. Using the discrete wavelet transform, motion artifacts can be deleted time and frequency selective. This filter approach leads to an improvement of the automatic QRS detection and decreases the number of false detections by 35 %.

N2  - The correct choice and customization of an orthosis are crucial to obtain the best  comfort and efficiency. This study explored the feasibility of a multivariate quantitative assessment of the functional efficiency of lower limb orthosis through a novel wearable system. Gait basographic parameters and energetic indexes were analysed during a Six-Minute Walking Test (6-MWT) through a cost-effective, non-invasive polygraph device, with a multichannel wireless transmission, that carried out electro-cardiograph (ECG); impedance-cardiograph (ICG); and lower-limb accelerations detection. Four subjects affected by Post-Polio Syndrome (PPS) were recruited. The wearable device and the semi-automatic post-processing software provided a novel set of objective data to assess the overall efficiency of the patient-orthosis system. Despite the small number of examined subjects, the results obtained with this new approach encourage the application of the method thus enlarging the dataset to validate this promising protocol and measuring system in supporting clinical decisions and out of a laboratory environment.

N2  - Beat-to-beat alternations in the amplitude of the cytosolic Ca(2+) transient (Ca(2+)  alternans) are thought to be the primary cause of cardiac alternans that can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and sudden death. Despite its important role in arrhythmogenesis, the mechanism underlying Ca(2+) alternans remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated the role of cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR2), the major Ca(2+) release channel responsible for cytosolic Ca(2+) transients, in cardiac alternans. Using a unique mouse model harboring a suppression-of-function (SOF) RyR2 mutation (E4872Q), we assessed the effect of genetically suppressing RyR2 function on Ca(2+) and action potential duration (APD) alternans in intact hearts, and electrocardiogram (ECG) alternans in vivo We found that RyR2-SOF hearts displayed prolonged sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) release refractoriness and enhanced propensity for Ca(2+) alternans. RyR2-SOF hearts/mice also exhibited increased propensity for APD and ECG alternans. Caffeine, which enhances RyR2 activity and the propensity for catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT), suppressed Ca(2+) alternans in RyR2-SOF hearts, whereas carvedilol, a β-blocker that suppresses RyR2 activity and CPVT, promoted Ca(2+) alternans in these hearts. Thus, RyR2 function is an important determinant of Ca(2+), APD, and ECG alternans. Our data also indicate that the activity of RyR2 influences the propensity for cardiac alternans and CPVT in an opposite manner. Therefore, overly suppressing or enhancing RyR2 function is pro-arrhythmic.

N2  - Interest in research involving health-medical information analysis based on  artificial intelligence, especially for deep learning techniques, has recently been increasing. Most of the research in this field has been focused on searching for new knowledge for predicting and diagnosing disease by revealing the relation between disease and various information features of data. These features are extracted by analyzing various clinical pathology data, such as EHR (electronic health records), and academic literature using the techniques of data analysis, natural language processing, etc. However, still needed are more research and interest in applying the latest advanced artificial intelligence-based data analysis technique to bio-signal data, which are continuous physiological records, such as EEG (electroencephalography) and ECG (electrocardiogram). Unlike the other types of data, applying deep learning to bio-signal data, which is in the form of time series of real numbers, has many issues that need to be resolved in preprocessing, learning, and analysis. Such issues include leaving feature selection, learning parts that are black boxes, difficulties in recognizing and identifying effective features, high computational complexities, etc. In this paper, to solve these issues, we provide an encoding-based Wave2vec time series classifier model, which combines signal-processing and deep learning-based natural language processing techniques. To demonstrate its advantages, we provide the results of three experiments conducted with EEG data of the University of California Irvine, which are a real-world benchmark bio-signal dataset. After converting the bio-signals (in the form of waves), which are a real number time series, into a sequence of symbols or a sequence of wavelet patterns that are converted into symbols, through encoding, the proposed model vectorizes the symbols by learning the sequence using deep learning-based natural language processing. The models of each class can be constructed through learning from the vectorized wavelet patterns and training data. The implemented models can be used for prediction and diagnosis of diseases by classifying the new data. The proposed method enhanced data readability and intuition of feature selection and learning processes by converting the time series of real number data into sequences of symbols. In addition, it facilitates intuitive and easy recognition, and identification of influential patterns. Furthermore, real-time large-capacity data analysis is facilitated, which is essential in the development of real-time analysis diagnosis systems, by drastically reducing the complexity of calculation without deterioration of analysis performance by data simplification through the encoding process.

N2  - AIMS: The Selvester QRS scoring system uses quantitative criteria from the standard  12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) to estimate the myocardial scar size of patients, including those with left bundle branch block (LBBB). Automation of the scoring system could facilitate the clinical use of this technique which requires a set of multiple QRS patterns to be identified and measured. METHODS AND RESULTS: We developed a series of algorithms to automatically detect and measure the QRS parameters required for Selvester scoring. The 'QUantitative and Automatic REport of Selvester Score' was designed specifically for the analysis of ECGs from patients meeting new strict criteria for complete LBBB. The algorithms were designed using a training (n = 36) and a validation (n = 180) set of ECGs, consisting of signal-averaged 12-lead ECGs (1000 Hz sampling) recorded from 216 LBBB patients from the MADIT-CRT. We assessed the performance of the methods using expert manually adjudicated ECGs. The average of absolute differences between automatic and adjudicated Selvester scoring was 1.2 ± 1.5 points. The range of average differences for continuous measurements of wave locations and interval durations varied between 0 and 6 ms. Erroneous detection of Q, R, S, R', and S' waves (oversensed or missed) were 3, 1, 1, 16, and 6%, respectively. Seven percent of notches detected in the first 40 ms were misdetected. CONCLUSION: We propose an efficient computerized method for the automatic measurement of the Selvester score in patients with the strict LBBB.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: We developed an automatic algorithm to determine rapid eye movement (REM)  sleep on the basis of the autonomic activities reflected in heart rate variations. APPROACH: The heart rate variability (HRV) parameters were calculated using the R-R intervals from an electrocardiogram (ECG). A major autonomic variation associated with the sleep cycle was extracted from a combination of the obtained parameters. REM sleep was determined with an adaptive threshold applied to the acquired feature. The algorithm was optimized with the data from 26 healthy subjects and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients and was validated with data from a separate group of 25 healthy and OSA subjects. MAIN RESULTS: According to an epoch-by-epoch (30 s) analysis, the average of Cohen's kappa and the accuracy were respectively 0.63 and 87% for the training set and 0.61 and 87% for the validation set. In addition, the REM sleep-related information extracted from the results of the proposed method revealed a significant correlation with those from polysomnography (PSG). SIGNIFICANCE: The current algorithm only using R-R intervals can be applied to mobile and wearable devices that acquire heart-rate-related signals; therefore, it is appropriate for sleep monitoring in the home and ambulatory environments. Further, long-term sleep monitoring could provide useful information to clinicians and patients for the diagnosis and treatments of sleep-related disorders and individual health care.

N2  - Electrocardiographic imaging (ECG imaging) is a method to depict  electrophysiological processes in the heart. It is an emerging technology with the potential of making the therapy of cardiac arrhythmia less invasive, less expensive, and more precise. A major challenge for integrating the method into clinical workflow is the seamless and correct identification and localization of electrodes on the thorax and their assignment to recorded channels. This work proposes a camera-based system, which can localize all electrode positions at once and to an accuracy of approximately 1 ± 1 mm. A system for automatic identification of individual electrodes is implemented that overcomes the need of manual annotation. For this purpose, a system of markers is suggested, which facilitates a precise localization to subpixel accuracy and robust identification using an error-correcting code. The accuracy of the presented system in identifying and localizing electrodes is validated in a phantom study. Its overall capability is demonstrated in a clinical scenario.

N2  - The aim was to investigate the effect of interferences surviving preprocessing  (residual noise, baseline wanderings, respiration modulation, replaced beats, missed beats and T-waves misalignment) on automatic identification of T-wave alternans (TWA), an ECG index of risk for sudden cardiac death. The procedures denominated fast-Fourier-transform spectral method (FFTSM), complex-demodulation method (CDM), modified-moving-average method (MMAM), Laplacian-likelihood-ratio method (LLRM), and adaptive-match-filter method (AMFM) were applied to interferences-corrupted synthetic ECG tracings and Holter ECG recordings from control-healthy subjects (CH-group; n=25) and acute-myocardial-infarction patients (AMI group; n=25). The presence of interferences in simulated data caused detection of false-positive TWA by all techniques but the FFTSM and AMFM. Clinical applications evidenced a discrepancy in that the FFTSM and LLRM detected no more than one TWA case in each population, whereas the CDM, MMAM, and AMFM detected TWA in all CH-subjects and AMI-patients, with significantly lower TWA amplitude in the former group. Because the AMFM is not prone to false-positive TWA detections, the latter finding suggests TWA as a phenomenon having continuously changing amplitude from physiological to pathological conditions. Only occasional detection of TWA by the FFTSM and LLRM in clinics can be ascribed to their limited ability in identifying TWA in the presence of interferences surviving preprocessing.

N2  - Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major public concern and socioeconomic problem  across the globe. The popular high-end cardiac health monitoring systems such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computerized tomography scan (CT scan), and echocardiography (Echo) are highly expensive and do not support long-term continuous monitoring of patients without disrupting their activities of daily living (ADL). In this paper, the continuous and non-invasive cardiac health monitoring using unobtrusive sensors is explored aiming to provide a feasible and low-cost alternative to foresee possible cardiac anomalies in an early stage. It is learned that cardiac health monitoring based on sole usage of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals may not provide powerful insights as ECG provides shallow information on various cardiac activities in the form of electrical impulses only. Hence, a novel low-cost, non-invasive seismocardiogram (SCG) signal along with ECG signals are jointly investigated for the robust cardiac health monitoring. For this purpose, the in-laboratory data collection model is designed for simultaneous acquisition of ECG and SCG signals followed by mechanisms for the automatic delineation of relevant feature points in acquired ECG and SCG signals. In addition, separate feature points based novel approach is adopted to distinguish between normal and abnormal morphology in each ECG and SCG cardiac cycle. Finally, a combined analysis of ECG and SCG is carried out by designing a Naïve Bayes conditional probability model. Experiments on Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved licensed ECG/SCG signals acquired from real subjects containing 12,000 cardiac cycles show that the proposed feature point delineation mechanisms and abnormal morphology detection methods consistently perform well and give promising results. In addition, experimental results show that the combined analysis of ECG and SCG signals provide more reliable cardiac health monitoring compared to the standalone use of ECG and SCG.

N2  - A personal computer-based arrhythmia generator has been developed based upon  mathematical models of modulated parasystole and the related equations. A system of nonlinear difference equations is used to generate the time series of RR intervals of ECG that contain normal as well as ectopic QRS waves. The ECG waveform is synthesized according to the computed RR interval and the type of QRS wave and output via DA converter in a real-time base. Various types of ECGs with ventricular ectopic beats and those with very long periods were generated by selecting values for a small number of model parameters. This method requires neither large RAM nor external memory for storing a library of arrhythmic ECGs. The theory, hardware design, software implementation on a personal computer, and experimental reconstruction of clinical ECGs based on the model are discussed.

N2  - In this paper, a methodology is described in order to investigate the performance of  empirical mode decomposition (EMD) in biomedical signals, and especially in the case of electrocardiogram (ECG). Synthetic ECG signals corrupted with white Gaussian noise are employed and time series of various lengths are processed with EMD in order to extract the intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). A statistical significance test is implemented for the identification of IMFs with high-level noise components and their exclusion from denoising procedures. Simulation campaign results reveal that a decrease of processing time is accomplished with the introduction of preprocessing stage, prior to the application of EMD in biomedical time series. Furthermore, the variation in the number of IMFs according to the type of the preprocessing stage is studied as a function of SNR and time-series length. The application of the methodology in MIT-BIH ECG records is also presented in order to verify the findings in real ECG signals.

N2  - Automatic myocardial infarction (MI) detection using an electrocardiogram (ECG) is  of great significance for improving the survival rate of patients. In this study, we propose a multi-lead ensemble neural network (MENN) to distinguish anterior myocardial infarction (AMI) and inferior myocardial infarction (IMI) from healthy control (HC) respectively. In the study, three kinds of sub-networks and multi-lead ECG signals are combined, which fully explores the information of ECG signals and improves the classification performance. The algorithm is evaluated on the PTB database by 5-fold inter-subject cross-validation and the sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp) and area under the curve (AUC) of AMI detection are 98.35%, 97.49%, 97.92%; The Se, Sp, and AUC of IMI detection are 93.17%, 92.02%, 92.60%. The proposed method achieves the state of the art results on both tasks and outperforms the baseline methods. Hence, the proposed method is potential for automatic MI diagnosis.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The evaluation of native coronary arteries (NCAs) as well as coronary  artery bypass graft (CABG) patency after surgery is essential. However, NCAs are often blurred in the craniocaudal scan direction because of long scan time with 64-slice CT. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the study was to determine the effect of scan direction on image quality and radiation exposure in assessment of NCAs and CABGs. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of 191 consecutive individuals undergoing coronary CT angiography to evaluate CABG patency using 64-slice dual source CT. A retrospectively ECG gated spiral acquisition protocol with ECG based tube current modulation and automatic adjustment of tube current to a reference of 320 mAs ("CareDose 4D") was used. Tube current was 120 kVp. Scan direction was either cranio-caudal (CRC, n = 98) or caudo-cranial (CRC, n = 93) and the scan volume covered the entire course of all bypass grafts. Independent investigators determined quantitative image quality of the coronary arteries by evaluating contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), radiation exposure by comparing the effective dose, and qualitative image quality through a 5 point rating scale. RESULTS: Quantitative image quality was not significantly different for the two groups except for the CNR of the right coronary artery which was significantly higher in patients with caudio-cranial scan direction (P = .0007). The qualitative image quality of the CaC group also was better for both NCAs and CABGs (P = .002 for NCAs and <.001 for CABGs), mostly because of the lower frequency of respiration artifacts on coronary arteries of the CaC group (P = .005). As an effect of automatic tube current adjustment, radiation dose was lower in patients with caudo-cranial scan direction (6.8 mSv vs. 9.6 mSv, p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: In patients with coronary bypass grafts imaged by 64-slice dual source CT with spiral acquisition and automated tube current adjustment, a caudo-cranial scan direction results in improved image quality and reduced radiation exposure.

N2  - Objective. The aim of the study was to develop a complex electrophysiological  measurement system (hardware and software) which uses the methods of electrophysiology and provides significant information about the intrauterine status of the fetus, intending to obtain true-to-form, morphologically evaluated fetal ECG from transabdominal maternal lead. Results. The present method contains many novel ideas that allow creating true-to-form noninvasive fetal ECG in the third trimester of the pregnancy in 80% of the cases. Such ideas are the telemetric data collection, the "cleanse" of the real time recording from the maternal ECG, and the use of the cardiotocograph (CTG) that allows identifying the fetal heart events. The advantage of this developed system is that it does not require any qualified staff, because both the extraction of the information from the abdominal recording and the processing of the data are automatic. Discussion. Although the idea of a noninvasive fetal electrocardiography is more than 100 years old still there is no simple, effective, and cheap method available that would enable an extensive use. This developed system can be used in the third trimester of the pregnancy efficiently. It can produce true-to-form fetal ECGs with amplitude less than 10 µV.

N2  - The further exploration of the capacitive ECG (cECG) is hindered by frequent  fluctuations in signal quality from body movement and changes in sleep position. The processing framework must be fundamentally adapted to make full use of this signal. Therefore, we propose a new signal-processing framework that determines the signal quality for short signal segments (2 and 4 seconds) using a multi-class classification model (qua_model) based on a convolutional neural network (CNN). We built another independent deep CNN classifier (pos_model) to classify the sleep position. In the validation, 12 subjects were recruited for a 30-minute experiment, which required the subjects to lie on a bed in different sleeping positions. The short segments, classified as clear (C1 class) by the qua_model, were used to determine sleep positions with the pos_model. In 10-fold cross-validation, the qua_model for signals of 4-second length could recognize the signal of the C1 class at a 0.99 precision and a 0.99 recall; the pos_model could recognize the supine sleep position, the left, and right lateral sleep positions at a 0.99 averaged precision and a 0.99 averaged recall. Given the amount of data accumulated per night and the instability in the signal quality, this fully automatic processing framework is indispensable for a personal healthcare system. Therefore, this study could serve as an important step for cECG technique trying to explore the cECG for unconstrained heart monitoring.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: The paper presents a diagnostic algorithm for classifying cardiac  tachyarrhythmias for implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs). The main aim was to develop an algorithm that could reduce the rate of occurrence of inappropriate therapies, which are often observed in existing ICDs. To achieve low energy consumption, which is a critical factor for implantable medical devices, very low computational complexity of the algorithm was crucial. The study describes and validates such an algorithm and estimates its clinical value. METHODOLOGY: The algorithm was based on the heart rate variability (HRV) analysis. The input data for our algorithm were: RR-interval (I), as extracted from raw intracardiac electrogram (EGM), and in addition two other features of HRV called here onset (ONS) and instability (INST). 6 diagnostic categories were considered: ventricular fibrillation (VF), ventricular tachycardia (VT), sinus tachycardia (ST), detection artifacts and irregularities (including extrasystoles) (DAI), atrial tachyarrhythmias (ATF) and no tachycardia (i.e. normal sinus rhythm) (NT). The initial set of fuzzy rules based on the distributions of I, ONS and INST in the 6 categories was optimized by means of a software tool for automatic rule assessment using simulated annealing. A training data set with 74 EGM recordings was used during optimization, and the algorithm was validated with a validation data set with 58 EGM recordings. Real life recordings stored in defibrillator memories were used. Additionally the algorithm was tested on 2 sets of recordings from the PhysioBank databases: MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database and MIT-BIH Supraventricular Arrhythmia Database. A custom CMOS integrated circuit implementing the diagnostic algorithm was designed in order to estimate the power consumption. A dedicated Web site, which provides public online access to the algorithm, has been created and is available for testing it. RESULTS: The total number of events in our training and validation sets was 132. In total 57 shocks and 28 antitachycardia pacing (ATP) therapies were delivered by ICDs. 25 out of 57 shocks were unjustified: 7 for ST, 12 for DAI, 6 for ATF. Our fuzzy rule-based diagnostic algorithm correctly recognized all episodes of VF and VT, except for one case where VT was recognized as VF. In four cases short lasting, spontaneously ending VT episodes were not detected (in these cases no therapy was needed and they were not detected by ICDs either). In other words, a fuzzy logic algorithm driven ICD would deliver one unjustified shock and deliver correct therapies in all other cases. In the tests, no adjustments of our algorithm to individual patients were needed. The sensitivity and specificity calculated from the results were 100% and 98%, respectively. In 126 ECG recordings from PhysioBank (about 30min each) our algorithm incorrectly detected 4 episodes of VT, which should rather be classified as fast supraventricular tachycardias. The estimated power consumption of the dedicated integrated circuit implementing the algorithm was below 120nW. CONCLUSION: The paper presents a fuzzy logic-based control algorithm for ICD. Its main advantages are: simplicity and ability to decrease the rate of occurrence of inappropriate therapies. The algorithm can work in real time (i.e. update the diagnosis after every RR-interval) with very limited computational resources.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Automatic detection and classification of noises can play a vital role in  the development of robust unsupervised electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis systems. This paper proposes a novel unified framework for automatic detection, localization, and classification of single and combined ECG noises. METHODS: The proposed framework consists of the modified ensemble empirical mode decomposition (CEEMD), the short-term temporal feature extraction, and the decision-rule-based noise detection and classification. In the proposed framework, ECG signals are first decomposed using the modified CEEMD algorithm for discriminating the ECG components from the noises and artifacts. Then, the short-term temporal features such as maximum absolute amplitude, number of zerocrossings, and local maximum peak amplitude of the autocorelation function are computed from the extracted high-frequency and low-frequency signals. Finally, a decision rule-based algorithm is presented for detecting the presence of noises and classifying the processed ECG signals into six signal groups: noise-free ECG, ECG+BW, ECG+MA, ECG+PLI, ECG+BW+PLI, and ECG+BW+MA. RESULTS: The proposed framework is rigorously evaluated on five benchmark ECG databases and the real-time ECG signals. The proposed framework achieves an average sensitivity of 99.12%, specificity of 98.56%, and overall accuracy of 98.90% in detecting the presence of noises. Classification results show that the framework achieves an average sensitivity, positive predictivity, and classification accuracy of 98.93%, 98.39%, and 97.38%, respectively. CONCLUSION: The proposed framework not only achieves better noise detection and classification rates than the current state-of-the-art methods but also accurately localizes short bursts of noises with low endpoint delineation errors. SIGNIFICANCE: Extensive studies on benchmark databases demonstrate that the proposed framework is more suitable for reducing false alarm rates and selecting appropriate noise-specific denoising techniques in automated ECG analysis applications.

N2  - The variability of electric and magnetic signals from the heart during the  depolarization phase is investigated. A signal processing method is developed which provides estimates for the beat-to-beat variability of the QRS-complex. The method is based on the decomposition of the depolarization signal into bandpass signals by means of the Morlet wavelet transform. The beat variability of the depolarization signal is estimated by normalized variances of the envelope and instantaneous frequency of bandpass signals. Time intervals of the bandpass filtered depolarization signals having a high signal-to-noise ratio are selected by applying an analysis based on phase statistics. The method was tested by experimental data taken from ECG and MCG measurements of healthy persons and patients prone to malignant ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF). Results suggest that the calculated variance parameters permit the characterization of beat variable depolarization signals and distinguish VT/VF patients from healthy persons. The method developed can be used to obtain additional information concerning abnormal heart signals which is attenuated when applying signal averaging.

N2  - An automated algorithm to assess electrocardiogram (ECG) quality for both normal and  abnormal rhythms is presented for false arrhythmia alarm suppression of intensive care unit (ICU) monitors. A particular focus is given to the quality assessment of a wide variety of arrhythmias. Data from three databases were used: the Physionet Challenge 2011 dataset, the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database, and the MIMIC II database. The quality of more than 33 000 single-lead 10 s ECG segments were manually assessed and another 12 000 bad-quality single-lead ECG segments were generated using the Physionet noise stress test database. Signal quality indices (SQIs) were derived from the ECGs segments and used as the inputs to a support vector machine classifier with a Gaussian kernel. This classifier was trained to estimate the quality of an ECG segment. Classification accuracies of up to 99% on the training and test set were obtained for normal sinus rhythm and up to 95% for arrhythmias, although performance varied greatly depending on the type of rhythm. Additionally, the association between 4050 ICU alarms from the MIMIC II database and the signal quality, as evaluated by the classifier, was studied. Results suggest that the SQIs should be rhythm specific and that the classifier should be trained for each rhythm call independently. This would require a substantially increased set of labeled data in order to train an accurate algorithm.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: Biosignal data include important physiological information. For that  reason, many devices and systems have been developed, but there has not been enough consideration of how to collect and integrate raw data from multiple systems. To overcome this limitation, we have developed a system for collecting and integrating biosignal data from two patient monitoring systems. METHODS: We developed an interface to extract biosignal data from Nihon Kohden and Philips monitoring systems. The Nihon Kohden system has a central server for the temporary storage of raw waveform data, which can be requested using the HL7 protocol. However, the Philips system used in our hospital cannot save raw waveform data. Therefore, our system was connected to monitoring devices using the RS232 protocol. After collection, the data were transformed and stored in a unified format. RESULTS: From September 2016 to August 2017, we collected approximately 117 patient-years of waveform data from 1,268 patients in 79 beds of five intensive care units. Because the two systems use the same data storage format, the application software could be run without compatibility issues. CONCLUSIONS: Our system collects biosignal data from different systems in a unified format. The data collected by the system can be used to develop algorithms or applications without the need to consider the source of the data.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Cardiac arrest due to torsades de pointes (TdP) is a rare but  catastrophic event in hospitals. Patients admitted to cardiac units are at higher risk of drug-induced QT interval prolongation and TdP, due to a preponderance of risk factors. Few data exist regarding the prevalence of QT interval prolongation in patients admitted to cardiac units or the frequency of administering QT interval-prolonging drugs to patients presenting with QT interval prolongation. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of Bazett's-corrected QT (QT(c)) interval prolongation upon admission to cardiac units and the proportion of patients presenting with QT(c) interval prolongation who are subsequently administered QT interval-prolonging drugs during hospitalization. METHODS: This was a prospective, observational study conducted over a 1-year period (October 2008-October 2009) in 1159 consecutive patients admitted to two cardiac units in a large urban academic medical centre located in Indianapolis, IN, USA. Patients were enrolled into the study at the time of admission to the hospital and were followed daily during hospitalization. Exclusion criteria were age <18 years, ECG rhythm of complete ventricular pacing, and patient designation as 'outpatient' in a bed and/or duration of stay <24 hours. Data collected included demographic information, past medical history, daily progress notes, medication administration records, laboratory data, ECGs, telemetry monitoring strips and diagnostic reports. All patients underwent continuous cardiac telemetry monitoring and/or had a baseline 12-lead ECG obtained within 4 hours of admission. QT intervals were determined manually from lead II of 12-lead ECGs or from continuous lead II telemetry monitoring strips. QT(c) interval prolongation was defined as ≥470 ms for males and ≥480 ms for females. In both males and females, QT(c) interval >500 ms was considered abnormally high. A medication was classified as QT interval-prolonging if there were published data indicating that the drug causes QT interval prolongation and/or TdP. Study endpoints were (i) prevalence of QT(c) interval prolongation upon admission to the Cardiac Medical Critical Care Unit (CMCCU) or an Advanced Heart Care Unit (AHCU); (ii) proportion of patients admitted to the CMCCU/AHCU with QT(c) interval prolongation who subsequently were administered QT interval-prolonging drugs during hospitalization; (iii) the proportion of these higher-risk patients in whom TdP risk factor monitoring was performed; (iv) proportion of patients with QT(c) interval prolongation who subsequently received QT-prolonging drugs and who experienced further QT(c) interval prolongation. RESULTS: Of 1159 patients enrolled, 259 patients met exclusion criteria, resulting in a final sample size of 900 patients. PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: mean (± SD) age, 65 ± 15 years; female, 47%; Caucasian, 70%. Admitting diagnoses: heart failure (22%), myocardial infarction (16%), atrial fibrillation (9%), sudden cardiac arrest (3%). QT(c) interval prolongation was present in 27.9% of patients on admission; 18.2% had QT(c) interval >500 ms. Of 251 patients admitted with QT(c) interval prolongation, 87 (34.7%) were subsequently administered QT interval-prolonging drugs. Of 166 patients admitted with QT(c) interval >500 ms, 70 (42.2%) were subsequently administered QT interval-prolonging drugs; additional QT(c) interval prolongation ≥60 ms occurred in 57.1% of these patients. CONCLUSIONS: QT(c) interval prolongation is common among patients admitted to cardiac units. QT interval-prolonging drugs are commonly prescribed to patients presenting with QT(c) interval prolongation.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The localization of origins of premature ventricular contraction (PVC)  is the key factor for the success of ablation of ventricular arrhythmias. Existing methods rely heavily on manual extraction of PVC beats, which limits their application to the automatic PVC recognition from long-term data recorded by ECG monitors before and during operation. Besides, researches identifying PVC sources in the whole ventricle have not been reported. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to validate the feasibility of localization of origins of PVC in the whole ventricle and to explore an automatic algorithm for recognition of PVC beat based on long-term 12-lead ECG. METHODS: This study included 249 patients with spontaneous PVCs or pacing-induced PVCs. A novel algorithm was used to automatically extract PVC beats from massive original ECG data which were collected by different acquisition devices. After clustering and labelling, 374 sample groups, with each containing dozens to hundreds of PVC beats, formed the entire dataset of 11 categories which correspond to 11 regions of PVC origins in the whole ventricle. To choose the best classification model for current task, four machine learning methods, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) and Gaussian Navïe Bayes (GNB), were compared by randomly selecting 70% of the entire dataset (sample groups = 257) for training and the remaining 30% (sample groups = 117) for testing. The average performance of each model was estimated by bootstrap method using 1000 resampling trials. RESULTS: For PVC beat recognition, the achieved testing accuracy, sensitivity and specificity is 97.6%, 98.3% and 96.7%, respectively. For localization purpose, the achieved testing accuracy varies slightly from 70.7% to 74.1% among four classifiers, and when neighboring regions were combined, the testing rank accuracy is improved to a range of 91.5% to 93.2%. CONCLUSION: The proposed algorithm can automatically recognize PVC beats and map them to one of the 11 regions in the whole ventricle. Owing to the high accuracy of PVC beat recognition and the capability to target the potential PVC origins in multi regions, it is expected to be a predominant technique being used in clinical settings to automatically analyze huge ECG data before and during operation so as to replace the tedious manual identification.

N2  - Cardiovascular diseases are one of the most common causes of death; however, the  early detection of patients at high risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD) remains an issue. The aim of this study was to analyze the cardio-vascular couplings based on heart rate variability (HRV) and blood pressure variability (BPV) analyses in order to introduce new indices for noninvasive risk stratification in idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy patients (IDC). High-resolution electrocardiogram (ECG) and continuous noninvasive blood pressure (BP) signals were recorded in 91 IDC patients and 49 healthy subjects (CON). The patients were stratified by their SCD risk as high risk (IDC(HR)) when after two years the subject either died or suffered life-threatening complications, and as low risk (IDC(LR)) when the subject remained stable during this period. Values were extracted from ECG and BP signals, the beat-to-beat interval, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and analyzed using the segmented Poincaré plot analysis (SPPA), the high-resolution joint symbolic dynamics (HRJSD) and the normalized short time partial directed coherence methods. Support vector machine (SVM) models were built to classify these patients according to SCD risk. IDC(HR) patients presented lowered HRV and increased BPV compared to both IDC(LR) patients and the control subjects, suggesting a decrease in their vagal activity and a compensation of sympathetic activity. Both, the cardio -systolic and -diastolic coupling strength was stronger in high-risk patients when comparing with low-risk patients. The cardio-systolic coupling analysis revealed that the systolic influence on heart rate gets weaker as the risk increases. The SVM IDC(LR) vs. IDC(HR) model achieved 98.9% accuracy with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.96. The IDC and the CON groups obtained 93.6% and 0.94 accuracy and AUC, respectively. To simulate a circumstance in which the original status of the subject is unknown, a cascade model was built fusing the aforementioned models, and achieved 94.4% accuracy. In conclusion, this study introduced a novel method for SCD risk stratification for IDC patients based on new indices from coupling analysis and non-linear HRV and BPV. We have uncovered some of the complex interactions within the autonomic regulation in this type of patient.

N2  - Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the number one cause of death globally. An  estimated 17.9 million people die from CVDs each year, representing 31% of all global deaths. Most cardiac patients require early detection and treatment. Therefore, many products to monitor patient's heart conditions have been introduced on the market. Most of these devices can record a patient's bio-metric signals both in resting and in exercising situations. However, reading the massive amount of raw electrocardiogram (ECG) signals from the sensors is very time-consuming. Automatic anomaly detection for the ECG signals could act as an assistant for doctors to diagnose a cardiac condition. This paper reviews the current state-of-the-art of this technology discusses the pros and cons of the devices and algorithms found in the literature and the possible research directions to develop the next generation of ambulatory monitoring systems.

N2  - Obesity is accompanied by many severe complications including various cardiovascular  disorders. An impairment of cardiovascular control by autonomic nervous system could be one of the possible links between obesity and cardiovascular complications development. The aim of this study was to compare spontaneous heart rate and systolic blood pressure oscillations reflecting cardiovascular autonomic control of young obese subjects with normal control subjects by linear and nonlinear methods and to find sensitive markers of early autonomic dysregulation. Continuous recordings of beat-to-beat systolic blood pressure and RR intervals from ECG were obtained from 40 obese subjects (25 female, age 14·2 [13·1-16·1] (median [interquartile range]) years) and gender and age matched non-obese control subjects. In addition to linear measures (time and frequency domain), we performed recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) and multiscale entropy analysis for both signals. While no significant differences in heart rate and systolic blood pressure dynamics were detected by linear measures and MSE, analysis of recurrence plots from RR intervals time series showed significant differences - indices trapping time and maximal length of vertical from RQA were significantly higher in obese compared to control group. We conclude that heart rate and blood pressure control by autonomic nervous system in young obese subjects is relatively well preserved. However, novel RQA-related measures are able to detect early subtle abnormalities in cardiac autonomic control in obese subjects indicating decreased signal complexity.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Point of care ECG devices can improve the early detection of atrial  fibrillation (AF). The efficiency of such devices depends on the capability of automatic AF detection against normal sinus rhythm and other arrhythmias from a short single lead ECG record in the presence of noise and artifacts. The objective of this study was to develop an algorithm that classifies a short single lead ECG record into 'Normal', 'AF', 'Other' and 'Noisy' classes, and identify the challenges in developing such algorithms and potential mitigation steps. APPROACH: Rule-based identification was used to detect lead inversion and records too noisy to be of immediate use. A set of statistical and morphological features describing the rhythm was then extracted, and support vector machine classifiers were used to classify records into three classes: 'Normal', 'AF' or 'Other'. The algorithm was trained and tested using 12 186 short single lead ECGs recorded on a point of care device made available via the Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2017. MAIN RESULTS: The algorithm achieved a sensitivity of 77.5%, a specificity of 97.9% and an accuracy of 96.1% in the detection of AF from a non-AF rhythm in a five-fold cross validation. It achieved F1 measures of 89%, 78% and 67% for 'Normal', 'AF' and 'Other' classes, respectively, when evaluated with a hidden test set. The overall challenge score was 78%. SIGNIFICANCE: Most existing algorithms can distinguish the AF rhythm from the normal sinus rhythm when ECG recordings are clean and are obtained with multi-lead systems, while their ability to discriminate against other arrhythmias and noise remains largely unknown. This study proposes an algorithm that classifies a short single lead ECG record from point of care devices into 'Normal', 'AF', 'Other' and 'Noisy' classes and discusses computational approaches to mitigate any unique challenges such as lead inversion, low amplitude signals, noise and artifacts.

N2  - An experimental setting and software were developed to evaluate cardiac autonomic  function in unrestrained rats. Subcutaneously implanted ECG electrodes and an indwelling venous catheter were tunneled to a tail cuff in five rats. The ECG was A/D converted at 1000 Hz. After peak detection, a time series of RR intervals was obtained. Programs for the analysis of heart rate variability (HRV) were implemented in LabVIEW. Statistical properties were determined in the time domain. After cubic spline function curve fitting, resampling at 0.1 s and test for stationarity, power spectral analysis was performed on sampled records of 30 min duration after applying a sliding Hanning window (Welch method: 256 points (duration 25.6 s), 50% overlap and 0.039 Hz resolution). Algorithms were tested with simulated signals consisting of isolated frequency components, which were retrieved at their exact locations. Physiological validation of the system was performed by, beta-adrenergic and cholinergic blockade and by forced breathing at a fixed rate. Measurements were performed on five unrestrained rats under basal conditions. Mean RR was 174.2 +/- 3.6 ms; S.D., 13.3 +/- 4.6 ms; rMSSD, 5.2 + /- 1.2 ms; pNN10, 3.5 +/- 1.9% and pNN5, 18.7 +/- 6.4%. Low (0.19-0.74 Hz) and high frequency (0.78-2.5 Hz) power were determined (and also percent of low to total and high to total): 18.42 +/- 10.74 ms2 (22.9 +/- 6.5%) and 15.66 +/- 5.56 ms2 (19.9 +/- 2.7%), and the ratio low/high: 1.16 +/- 0.39. In conclusion, HRV analysis programs were developed and thoroughly tested through simulations and in vivo, under basal conditions and after pharmacological blockades. Using this software, HRV data from unrestrained rats were obtained.

N2  - This study is designed to investigate the feasibility of automatic sleep staging  using features only derived from electrocardiography (ECG) signal. The study was carried out using the framework of hidden Markov models (HMMs). The mean, and SD values of heart rates (HRs) computed from each 30-second epoch served as the features. The two feature sequences were first detrended by ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD), formed as a two-dimensional feature vector, and then converted into code vectors by vector quantization (VQ) method. The output VQ indexes were utilized to estimate parameters for HMMs. The proposed model was tested and evaluated on a group of healthy individuals using leave-one-out cross-validation. The automatic sleep staging results were compared with PSG estimated ones. Results showed accuracies of 82.2%, 76.0%, 76.1% and 85.5% for deep, light, REM and wake sleep, respectively. The findings proved that HRs-based HMM approach is feasible for automatic sleep staging and can pave a way for developing more efficient, robust, and simple sleep staging system suitable for home application.

N2  - An electrocardiogram marker to detect patients who have paroxysmal atrial  fibrillation (PAF) is reported. The data set of ECG records made available by PhysioNet for Cardiology Challenge 2001 was used. The method uses a filtered time series with a frequency range between 3 and 9 Hz obtained from the electrocardiogram record. Typically, frequencies observed when a patient is in atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter is within this frequency range. Filtering was done using wavelets. Thereafter, the temporal properties of this filtered time series are studied. The temporal properties studied are the standard deviation, standard deviation of successive differences, and the length of the ellipse in the Poincare plot. The results indicate that these temporal properties of patients with PAF are depressed compared to the healthy group. A marker based on these temporal properties shows promise in detecting PAF when patients are in normal sinus rhythm. Results also show that the values for these temporal properties for a patient with PAF show little variation with time, and its measure is not dependent on the time of occurrence of a PAF episode.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: For nonclinical drug development, it is optimal if safety pharmacology  and toxicology studies are performed in a model that reasonably represents the patient the drug is intended to treat. To simulate prolonged inhalation therapy in ventilated patients, GLP inhalation toxicology methods, including safety pharmacology endpoints, in anesthetized, intubated and mechanically ventilated dogs were developed. This model required establishment of a canine intensive care unit (ICU) capable of providing prolonged anesthesia (propofol infusion and morphine titration) and partial parenteral nutrition (dextrose, amino acids and lipids) while safety parameters were monitored. METHOD: Telemetry was used to continuously monitor heart rate, ECG and blood pressure. Blood gas parameters were periodically measured while oxygen saturation and core temperature were reported continuously. Glucose was measured hourly while other standard clinical pathology (hematology, coagulation, clinical chemistry) samples were evaluated approximately every 12 h. Aerosols were administered continuously over 48 h by inhalation using a mesh nebulizer (Aerogen Solo) fed by a syringe pump into a humidified circuit of a critical care ventilator (LTV® 1000) ending in an endotracheal tube placed in the trachea. Animals were ventilated with pressure control ventilation targeting a respiratory minute volume of 2.0-3.5 l per minute (LPM). Peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) was maintained between 10 and 17 cm H(2)O and inspiratory time was set to 1 s with an inspiratory:expiratory (I:E) ratio of 1:2. Ventilator parameters and anesthesia were adjusted to maintain normal PaCO(2) levels and adequate sedation, respectively. Novel methods were developed to determine dose and particle size in vitro as on-line measurements were not feasible during in vivo aerosol delivery. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Acceptable baseline measurements were established for all parameters over the 48-h evaluation period, qualifying the method as appropriate for assessment of GLP safety pharmacology and toxicology studies.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to Identify whether changes in heart rate  variability (HRV) could be detected as critical illness resolves by comparing HRV from the time of pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) admission with HRV immediately prior to discharge. We also sought to demonstrate that HRV derived from electrocardiogram (ECG) data from bedside monitors can be calculated in critically-ill children using a real-time, streaming analytics platform. METHODS: This was a retrospective, observational pilot study of 17 children aged 0 to 18 years admitted to the PICU of a free-standing, academic children's hospital. Three time-domain measures of HRV were calculated in real-time from bedside monitor ECG data and stored for analysis. Measures included: root mean square of successive differences between NN intervals (RMSSD), percent of successive NN interval differences above 50 ms (pNN50), and the standard deviation of NN intervals (SDNN). RESULTS: HRV values calculated from the first and last 24 hours of PICU stay were analyzed. Mixed effects models demonstrated that all three measures of HRV were significantly lower during the first 24 hours compared to the last 24 hours of PICU admission (p<0.001 for all three measures). In models exploring the relationship between time from admission and log HRV values, the predicted average HRV remained consistently higher in the last 24 hours of PICU stay compared to the first 24 hours. CONCLUSION: HRV was significantly lower in the first 24 hours compared to the 24 hours preceding PICU discharge, after resolution of critical illness. This demonstrates that it is feasible to detect changes in HRV using an automated, streaming analytics platform. Continuous tracking of HRV may serve as a marker of recovery in critically ill children.

N2  - A 58 years healthy old woman was admitted to the Emergency Department (ED) with  cardiac arrest due to ventricular fibrillation (VF). Appropriate cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), multiple DC shocks and oro-tracheal intubation (OTI) were effective to induce recovery of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). After ROSC was achieved, the electrocardiogram (ECG) showed an idio-ventricular rhythm with atrioventricular dissociation. A transcutaneous pacing was hence applied and the patient was administered with isoproterenol. Simultaneously, her husband was evaluated in the ED for gastrointestinal symptoms occurred after assumption of home-made "tortelli" (ravioli-like pasta) stuffed with cheese and leaves of a plant which they supposed to be borage two days before admission. Borage, during the non-flowering seasons, can be easily confused with foxglove (Digitalis spp.), and this was the main clue to suspect poisoning. Both patients were given DigiFab®, a sheep antibody fragment with high affinity for digoxin. The woman was then admitted in intensive care unit (ICU), where a rapid clinical  improvement occurred, thus allowing discharge in a few days. The husband was instead discharged from the ED after clinical observation and ECG monitoring. In both cases, a significant plasma concentration of digoxin could be measured.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Heart rate variability (HRV) parameters, and especially RMSSD (root mean  squared successive differences in RR interval), could distinguish atrial fibrillation (AF) from sinus rhythm(SR) in horses, as was demonstrated in a previous study. If heart rate monitors (HRM) automatically calculating RMSSD could also distinguish AF from SR, they would be useful for the monitoring of AF recurrence. The objective of the study was to assess whether RMSSD values obtained from a HRM can differentiate AF from SR in horses. Furthermore, the impact of artifact correction algorithms, integrated in the analyses software for HRV analyses was evaluated. Fourteen horses presented for AF treatment were simultaneously equipped with a HRM and an electrocardiogram (ECG). A two-minute recording at rest, walk and trot, before and after cardioversion, was obtained. RR intervals used were those determined automatically by the HRM and by the equine ECG analysis software, and those obtained after manual correction of QRS detection within the ECG software. RMSSD was calculated by the HRM software and by dedicated HRV software, using six different artifact filters. Statistical analysis was performed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test and receiver operating curves. RESULTS: The HRM, which applies a low level filter, produced high area under the curve (AUC) (> 0.9) and cut off values with high sensitivity and specificity. Similar results were obtained for the ECG, when low level artifact filtering was applied. When no artifact correction was used during trotting, an important decrease in AUC (0.75) occurred. CONCLUSION: In horses treated for AF, HRMs with automatic RMSSD calculations distinguish between AF and SR. Such devices might be a useful aid to monitor for AF recurrence in horses.

N2  - Electrocardiographic stress test records have a lot of artifacts. In this paper we  explore a simple method to characterize the amount of artifacts present in unprocessed RR stress test time series. Four time series classes were defined: Very good lead, Good lead, Low quality lead and Useless lead. 65 ECG, 8 lead, records of stress test series were analyzed. Firstly, RR-time series were annotated by two experts. The automatic methodology is based on dividing the RR-time series in non-overlapping windows. Each window is marked as noisy whenever it exceeds an established standard deviation threshold (SDT). Series are classified according to the percentage of windows that exceeds a given value, based upon the first manual annotation. Different SDT were explored. Results show that SDT close to 20% (as a percentage of the mean) provides the best results. The coincidence between annotators classification is 70.77% whereas, the coincidence between the second annotator and the automatic method providing the best matches is larger than 63%. Leads classified as Very good leads and Good leads could be combined to improve automatic heartbeat labeling.

N2  - BACKGROUND: There are no studies quantifying the nature of autonomic changes in  absence epilepsy. Aims : We characterized the heart rate variability (HRV) during pre-interictal epileptiform discharges (IED), IED and post-IED states in absence epilepsy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Electroencephalogram (EEG) records with generalized 3-Hz spike-wave discharges in 8 patients (M: F: 3 : 5; mean age: 13.0 ± 2.5 years) with absence epilepsy were identified and corresponding electrocardiogram (ECG) time series were obtained. The time domain HRV measures were applied to pre-IED, IED and post-IED simultaneous ECG tracing. RESULTS: There was slight tachycardia during the IED phase (pre-IED: 90.15 ± 3.45 bpm, IED: 94.82 ± 4.63 bpm, P = 0.09) which returned to baseline during the post-IED phase (post-IED: 89.65 ± 3.78 bpm). There was significant decrease in the standard deviation of RR interval (pre-IED: 40.0 ± 4.15 ms, IED: 30.4 ± 4.19 ms, P = 0.032) and trend in reduction of triangular index (pre-IED: 0.05 ± 0.01, IED: 0.04 ± 0.004, P = 0.08) during the IED phase when compared to pre-IED phase. The percentage of RR intervals >50 ms was lower during the IED phase and achieved significance when compared to post-IED phase (IED: 10.08 ± 4.89, post-IED: 18.74 ± 6.17, P = 0.050). While mean HR and RR interval significantly correlated with the duration of IEDs, there was no significant correlation between its duration with change in HRV parameters between the groups. There was no significant difference in HRV parameters between patients with long (>10s) and short (<10s) duration of IED. CONCLUSIONS: Transient increase in heart rate during IED phase was noted in patients with absence epilepsy. Longer duration of IED seems to be linked with significant tachycardia. While most HRV parameters did not reach statistical significance, standard deviation of RR intervals and triangular index was noted to be decreased during the IED phase and returns to pre-IED levels after the episode.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The acuteness score (based on the modified Anderson-Wilkins score)  estimates the acuteness of ischemia based on ST-segment, Q-wave and T-wave measurements obtained from the electrocardiogram (ECG) in patients with ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI). The score (range 1 (least acute) to 4 (most acute)) identifies patients with substantial myocardial salvage potential regardless of patient reported symptom duration. However, due to the complexity of the score, it is not used in clinical practice. Therefore, we aimed to develop a reliable algorithm that automatically computes the acuteness score. METHODS: We scored 50 pre-hospital ECGs from STEMI patients, manually and by the automated algorithm. We assessed the reliability test between the manual and automated algorithm by interclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and Bland-Altman plot. RESULTS: The ICC was 0.84 (95% CI 0.72-0.91), P<0.0001. The mean difference between manual and automated acuteness score was 0.17±0.66. In only two cases, there was a major disagreement between the two scores. There was an excellent agreement between the scores for the remaining 48 ECGs, all within the upper (1.46) and lower (-1.12) limits of agreement. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, we have developed an automated algorithm for measurement of the modified Anderson-Wilkins ECG acuteness score from the pre-hospital ECG in STEMI patients. This automated algorithm is highly reliable, can be applied in daily practice for research purposes and may be implemented in commercial automated ECG analysis programs to achieve practical use for decision support in the acute phase of STEMI.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is an arrhythmia commonly encountered in  clinical practice. There is a high risk of thromboembolism in patients with AF. Nonlinear analyses such as electroencephalogram (EEG), electrocardiogram (ECG), and respiratory movement have been used to quantify biological signals, and sample entropy (SampEn) has been employed as a statistical measure to evaluate complex systems. In this study, we examined the values of SampEn in ECG signals for patients with and without AF to measure the regularity and complexity. METHODS: ECG signals of lead II were recorded from 34 subjects without arrhythmia and 15 patients with chronic AF in a supine position. The ECG signals were converted into time-series data and SampEn was calculated. RESULTS: The SampEn values for the group without arrhythmia were 0.252 ± 0.114 [time lag (τ) = 1] and 0.533 ± 0.163 (τ = 5), and those for the chronic AF group were 0.392 ± 0.158 (τ = 1) and 0.759 ± 0.246 (τ = 5). The values of SampEn were significantly higher in the group with chronic AF than in the group without arrhythmia (P < 0.01 for τ = 1, P < 0.004 for τ = 5). The constructed three-dimensional vectors were plotted in time-delayed three-dimensional space. We used time lags of τ = 5 and τ = 1. The shape of the loops of the three-dimensional space was better for τ = 5. CONCLUSION: The values of SampEn from ECG for chronic AF patients were higher than for subjects without arrhythmia, suggesting greater complexity for the time-series from chronic AF patients. SampEn is considered a new index for evaluating complex systems in ECG.

N2  - A large heart rate (HR) increase at the onset of exercise has been linked to an  increased risk for adverse cardiovascular events, including cardiac death. However, the relationship between changes in cardiac autonomic regulation induced by exercise onset and the confirmed susceptibility to ventricular fibrillation (VF) has not been established. Therefore, a retrospective analysis of the HR response to exercise onset was made in mongrel dogs with healed myocardial infarctions that were either susceptible (S, n = 131) or resistant (R, n = 114) to VF (induced by a 2-min occlusion of the left circumflex artery during the last minute of exercise). The ECG was recorded, and time series analysis of HR variability (vagal activity index, the 0.24-1.04-Hz frequency component of R-R interval variability) was measured before and 30, 60, and 120 s after the onset of exercise (treadmill running). Exercise elicited significantly (ANOVA, P < 0.0001) greater increases in HR in susceptible dogs at all three times (e.g., at 60 s: R, 46.8 +/- 2.3 vs. S, 57.1 +/- 2.2 beats/min). However, the vagal activity index decreased to a similar extent in both groups of dogs (at 60 s: R, -2.8 +/- 0.1 vs. S, -3.0 +/- 0.2 ln ms2). Beta-adrenoceptor blockade (BB, propranolol 1.0 mg/kg iv) reduced the HR increase and eliminated the differences noted between the groups [at 60 s: R (n = 26), 40.4 +/- 3.2 vs. S (n = 31), 37.5 +/- 2.4 beats/min]. After BB, exercise once again elicited similar declines in vagal activity in both groups (at 60 s: R, -3.6 +/- 0.5 vs. S, -3.2 +/- 0.4 ln ms2). When considered together, these data suggest that at the onset of exercise HR increases to a greater extent in animals prone to VF compared with dogs resistant to this malignant arrhythmia due to an enhanced cardiac sympathetic activation in the susceptible dogs.

N2  - High false alarm rate in intensive care units (ICUs) has been identified as one of  the most critical medical challenges in recent years. This often results in overwhelming the clinical staff by numerous false or unurgent alarms and decreasing the quality of care through enhancing the probability of missing true alarms as well as causing delirium, stress, sleep deprivation and depressed immune systems for patients. One major cause of false alarms in clinical practice is that the collected signals from different devices are processed individually to trigger an alarm, while there exists a considerable chance that the signal collected from one device is corrupted by noise or motion artifacts. In this paper, we propose a low-computational complexity yet accurate game-theoretic feature selection method which is based on a genetic algorithm that identifies the most informative biomarkers across the signals collected from various monitoring devices and can considerably reduce the rate of false alarms (1).

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Compressive sensing (CS) approaches to electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis  provide efficient methods for real time encoding of cardiac activity. In doing so, it is important to assess the downstream effect of the compression on any signal processing and classification algorithms. CS is particularly suitable for low power wearable devices, thanks to its low-complex digital or hardware implementation that directly acquires a compressed version of the signal through random projections. In this work, we evaluate the impact of CS compression on atrial fibrillation (AF) detection accuracy. APPROACH: We compare schemes with data reconstruction based on wavelet and Gaussian models, followed by a P&T-based identification of beat-to-beat (RR) intervals on the MIT-BIH atrial fibrillation database. A state-of-the-art AF detector is applied to the RR time series and the accuracy of the AF detector is then evaluated under different levels of compression. We also consider a new beat detection procedure which operates directly in the compressed domain, avoiding costly signal reconstruction procedures. MAIN RESULTS: We demonstrate that for compression ratios up to 30[Formula: see text] the AF detector applied to RR intervals derived from the compressed signal exhibits results comparable to those achieved when employing a standard QRS detector on the raw uncompressed signals, and exhibits only a 2% accuracy drop at a compression ratio of 60%. We also show that the Gaussian-based reconstruction approach is superior in terms of AF detection accuracy, with a negligible drop in performance at a compression ratio  ⩽75%, compared to a wavelet approach, which exhibited a significant drop in accuracy at a compression ratio  ⩾65%. SIGNIFICANCE: The results suggest that CS should be considered as a plausible methodology for both efficient real time ECG compression (at moderate compression rates) and for offline analysis (at high compression rates).

N2  - BACKGROUND: Commonly the magnitude and frequency of bradycardia is underestimated in  the neonatal unit due to the long averaging time used in bedside oximeters. We aimed to assess the frequency and severity of bradycardia in preterm infants using the lowest averaging time (2 s) available on a clinical oximeter, compared with bradycardia detected using electrocardiogram (ECG), and whether bradycardia severity and postmenstrual age affected cerebral oxygenation. METHODS: Preterm infants (10 M/9F) were studied longitudinally at 26-31 (very preterm) and 32-38 weeks (late preterm) postmenstrual age. Heart rate falls calculated from ECG were used to determine mild or moderate/severe (MS) bradycardias. Cerebral tissue oxygenation index (TOI, %) was recorded and fractional tissue oxygen extraction (FTOE) calculated. RESULTS: Of the 615 bradycardias scored using ECG criteria, 10% were not detected by oximetry. TOI falls associated with bradycardias were greater for MS bradycardias compared with Mild for both groups (p < 0.001 for both). The FTOE associated with MS bradycardias was higher for the very preterm compared with the late preterm group (p < 0.001). In very preterm infants 61% of MS and 35% Mild bradycardias were associated with TOI nadirs below 55%. CONCLUSION: Even the most sensitive oximeter setting underestimates bradycardias. The cerebral effect from bradycardias in very preterm infants is more severe than in late preterm infants. Even the mild bradycardias are associated with falls in cerebral oxygenation. Routine NIRS monitoring of cerebral oxygenation in NICUs may increase staff awareness for interventions to reduce the repetitive falls in cerebral oxygenation in preterm infants.

N2  - Detection and real time monitoring of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) episodes are  very important tasks in healthcare. To suitably face them, this paper proposes an easy-to-use, cheap mobile-based approach relying on three steps. First, single-channel ECG data from a patient are collected by a wearable sensor and are recorded on a mobile device. Second, the automatic extraction of knowledge about that patient takes place offline, and a set of IF…THEN rules containing heart-rate variability (HRV) parameters is achieved. Third, these rules are used in our real-time mobile monitoring system: the same wearable sensor collects the single-channel ECG data and sends them to the same mobile device, which now processes those data online to compute HRV-related parameter values. If these values activate one of the rules found for that patient, an alarm is immediately produced. This approach has been tested on a literature database with 35 OSA patients. A comparison against five well-known classifiers has been carried out.

N2  - The characteristics of electrocardiogram (ECG) signal are fuzzy and random, so that  they are difficult for automatic analysis and diagnosis. To solve this problem, an uncertainties transformation model-Cloud Model, which is a fusion of qualitative and quantitative information, was tried to use to analyze the ECG signal. The model fusions the characters of fuzzy and random, just suit to the ECG automatic analysis and diagnosis system. Based on the theory of the cloudy transform and comprehensive cloud, the clustering of ECG signal was finished. Further more, the clinic experience of expert was summarized as classification rules based on the theory. The experiment data were from MIT/ BIH database. The experiment results showed more close to those of the expert's analysis. The describing result was more close to those of the more expert's with qualitative and quantitative information. It is well concluded that the method is an effective ECG signal analysis method.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the utility of machine learning algorithms for automatically  estimating prognosis in patients with repaired tetralogy of Fallot (ToF) using cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR). METHODS: We included 372 patients with ToF who had undergone CMR imaging as part of a nationwide prospective study. Cine loops were retrieved and subjected to automatic deep learning (DL)-based image analysis, trained on independent, local CMR data, to derive measures of cardiac dimensions and function. This information was combined with established clinical parameters and ECG markers of prognosis. RESULTS: Over a median follow-up period of 10 years, 23 patients experienced an endpoint of death/aborted cardiac arrest or documented ventricular tachycardia (defined as >3 documented consecutive ventricular beats). On univariate Cox analysis, various DL parameters, including right atrial median area (HR 1.11/cm², p=0.003) and right ventricular long-axis strain (HR 0.80/%, p=0.009) emerged as significant predictors of outcome. DL parameters were related to adverse outcome independently of left and right ventricular ejection fraction and peak oxygen uptake (p<0.05 for all). A composite score of enlarged right atrial area and depressed right ventricular longitudinal function identified a ToF subgroup at significantly increased risk of adverse outcome (HR 2.1/unit, p=0.007). CONCLUSIONS: We present data on the utility of machine learning algorithms trained on external imaging datasets to automatically estimate prognosis in patients with ToF. Due to the automated analysis process these two-dimensional-based algorithms may serve as surrogates for labour-intensive manually attained imaging parameters in patients with ToF.

N2  - The purpose of this study was to explore the modes of initiation and clinical  significance of malignant rapid ventricular arrhythmias (MRVAs).The surface 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) or sustained electrocardiomonitor graph was analyzed in 79 patients. All patients had at least 1 MRVA after being admitted to the hospital.According to the length of coupling interval of the initial premature ventricular contraction of MRVA, the modes of initiation of MRVA were divided into the following types: those initiated by premature ventricular contraction with short coupling intervals in patients with normal Q-T interval, and for which short-long-short sequences before MRVA precipitation were not observed; those initiated following short-long-short sequences, which were divided into 2 types according to the length of Q-T interval: a normal Q-T interval and a long Q-T interval. On the basis of the different modes of onset, treatments of MRVA were different.MRVAs have different modes of onset depending on the patients' underlying condition. Prompt recognition of the mode of onset is necessary to facilitate appropriate management. These findings could have important pathophysiologic and clinical implications.

N2  - Results of heart rate variability analysis depend on the quality of the initial RR  time series that is measured only in one lead of the ECG. This work shows that RR time series can subtly change from lead to lead so the choice of the analyzed lead is another source of uncertainty. The standard deviation of the differences of two RR time series obtained from different leads can change from 0.5 ms to more than 20 ms depending on the amount of noise, the morphological changes of the QRS complexes, the strategies of fiducial point determination and the measured subject. This source of uncertainty is in healthy subjects greater than that associated to the sampling frequency of the ECG for sampling frequencies greater than 400 Hz.

N2  - The automatic detection of atrial fibrillation (AF) is crucial for its association  with the risk of embolic stroke. Most of the existing AF detection methods usually convert 1D time-series electrocardiogram (ECG) signal into 2D spectrogram to train a complex AF detection system, which results in heavy training computation and high implementation cost. This paper proposes an AF detection method based on an end-to-end 1D convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture to raise the detection accuracy and reduce network complexity. By investigating the impact of major components of a convolutional block on detection accuracy and using grid search to obtain optimal hyperparameters of the CNN, we develop a simple, yet effective 1D CNN. Since the dataset provided by PhysioNet Challenge 2017 contains ECG recordings with different lengths, we also propose a length normalization algorithm to generate equal-length records to meet the requirement of CNN. Experimental results and analysis indicate that our method of 1D CNN achieves an average F(1) score of 78.2%, which has better detection accuracy with lower network complexity, as compared with the existing deep learning-based methods.

N2  - The analysis of P-wave variability from the electrocardiogram (ECG) has been  suggested as an early predictor of the onset of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF). Hence, a preventive treatment could be used to avoid the loss of normal sinus rhythm, thus minimising health risks and improving the patient's quality of life. In these previous studies the variability of different temporal and morphological P-wave features has been only analysed in a linear fashion. However, the electrophysiological alteration occurring in the atria before the onset of PAF has to be considered as an inherently complex, chaotic and non-stationary process. This work analyses the presence of non-linear dynamics in the P-wave progression before the onset of PAF through the application of the central tendency measure (CTM), which is a non-linear metric summarising the degree of variability in a time series. Two hour-length ECG intervals just before the arrhythmia onset belonging to 46 different PAF patients were analysed. In agreement with the invasively observed inhomogeneous atrial conduction preceding the onset of PAF, CTM for all the considered P-wave features showed higher variability when the arrhythmia was closer to its onset. A diagnostic accuracy around 80% to discern between ECG segments far from PAF and close to PAF was obtained with the CTM of the metrics considered. This result was similar to previous P-wave variability methods based on linear approaches. However, the combination of linear and non-linear methods with a decision tree improved considerably their discriminant ability up to 90%, thus suggesting that both dynamics could coexist at the same time in the fragmented depolarisation of the atria preceding the arrhythmia.

N2  - Nonlinear measures can capture the complex structure of the heart beating, and  recordings taken while the individual performs daily activities may help to understand the cardiac system's output in natural conditions. As healthy systems are characterized by having highly complex outputs, we hypothesized that the cardiac output from high anxious adolescents should be less complex than the output from their low anxious counterparts. In this study ECG was recorded for two hours in 50 adolescents while they performed regular school activities. Fractal dimension (FD), scaling exponents and multiscale entropy were calculated on the interbeat intervals time series. Both FD and entropy were significantly lower in the high-anxious group than the low-anxious group. These results suggest different heart-related regulation in adolescents who suffered from high anxious symptomatology.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Timely detection of atrial fibrillation (AF) may effectively prevent  cardiovascular consequences. However, traditional diagnostic tools are either poorly reliable (pulse palpation) or not readily accessible (ECG) in general practice. We tested whether an automatic oscillometric blood pressure (BP) monitor embedded with an algorithm for AF detection might be effective for opportunistic screening of asymptomatic AF in the community. SETTING: A community-based screening campaign in an unselected population to verify the feasibility of AF screening with a Microlife WatchBP Office BP monitor with a patented AFIB algorithm. When possible AF was detected (≥2 of 3 BP measurements reporting AF), a doctor immediately performed a single-lead ECG in order to confirm or exclude the presence of the arrhythmia. The main demographic and clinical data were also collected. PARTICIPANTS: 220 consecutive participants from an unselected sample of individuals in a small Italian community. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Number of patients detected with AF and diagnosed risk factors for AF. RESULTS: In 12 of 220 participants, the device detected possible AF during the BP measurement: in 4 of them (1.8%), the arrhythmia was confirmed by the ECG. Patients with AF were more likely to be older (77.0±1.2 vs 57.2±15.2 years, p=0.010), obese (50.0 vs 14.4%, p=0.048) and to suffer from a cardiovascular disease (50.0 vs 10.6%, p=0.014) than patients without AF. Participants with a positive BP AF reading and non-AF arrhythmias (n=8) did not differ in their general characteristics from participants with a negative BP AF reading and were younger than patients with AF (mean age 56.4±14.8, p=0.027; 5 of 8 participants aged <65 years). CONCLUSIONS: Opportunistic screening of AF by BP measurement is feasible to diagnose this arrhythmia in unaware participants, particularly in those older than 65 years, who are the target patient group recommended by current AF screening guidelines.

N2  - In this paper a methodology to identify sleep apnea events is presented. It uses  four easily computable features, three generally known ones and a newly proposed feature. Of the three well known parameters, two are computed from the RR interval time series and the other one from the approximate respiratory signal derived from the ECG using principal component analysis (PCA). The fourth feature is proposed in this paper and it is computed from the principal components of the QRS complexes. Together with a least squares support vector machines (LS-SVM) classifier using an RBF kernel, these four features achieve an accuracy on test data larger than 85% for a subject independent classification, and of more than 90% for a patient specific approach. These values are comparable with other results in the literature, but have the advantage that their computation is straightforward and much simpler. This can be important when implemented in a home monitoring system, which typically has limited computational resources.

N2  - Beat-to-beat variability of the QT interval (QTV) measured on surface ECG has  emerged as a potential marker for ventricular repolarization instability and has been used along with heart rate variability (HRV) to predict arrhythmic risk. Since measurement modalities of QTV have not been standardized, the objective of this study was to investigate the effect of ECG recording duration on QTV as well as HRV. Using a database of 30 min ECG recorded from 500 patients with acute myocardial infraction during rest, we extracted RR and QT interval time series and estimated different HRV and QTV metrics over windows of varying length. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and intra-class correlation analyses were computed to investigate the effect of recording length on consistency and short-term reproducibility of HRV and QTV variables. Good consistency (non-significant ANOVA results) and short-term reproducibility (intra-class correlation coefficients  >0.8) were demonstrated for all but standard deviation based metrics when at least 200 beats were included in the estimation. In conclusion, QTV can be quantified from resting ECG with good short-term consistency and reproducibility that is comparable to that of HRV.

N2  - Automatic detection of arrhythmia is of great significance for early prevention and  diagnosis of cardiovascular disease. Traditional feature engineering methods based on expert knowledge lack multidimensional and multi-view information abstraction and data representation ability, so the traditional research on pattern recognition of arrhythmia detection cannot achieve satisfactory results. Recently, with the increase of deep learning technology, automatic feature extraction of ECG data based on deep neural networks has been widely discussed. In order to utilize the complementary strength between different schemes, in this paper, we propose an arrhythmia detection method based on the multi-resolution representation (MRR) of ECG signals. This method utilizes four different up to date deep neural networks as four channel models for ECG vector representations learning. The deep learning based representations, together with hand-crafted features of ECG, forms the MRR, which is the input of the downstream classification strategy. The experimental results of big ECG dataset multi-label classification confirm that the F1 score of the proposed method is 0.9238, which is 1.31%, 0.62%, 1.18% and 0.6% higher than that of each channel model. From the perspective of architecture, this proposed method is highly scalable and can be employed as an example for arrhythmia recognition.

N2  - Electrocardiogram (ECG) signal gives a lot of information on the physiology of  heart. In reality, noise from various sources interfere with the ECG signal. To get the correct information on physiology of the heart, noise cancellation of the ECG signal is required. In this paper, the effectiveness of extended Kalman smoother (EKS) with the differential evolution (DE) technique for noise cancellation of the ECG signal is investigated. DE is used as an automatic parameter selection method for the selection of ten optimized components of the ECG signal, and those are used to create the ECG signal according to the real ECG signal. These parameters are used by the EKS for the development of the state equation and also for initialization of the parameters of EKS. EKS framework is used for denoising the ECG signal from the single channel. The effectiveness of proposed noise cancellation technique has been evaluated by adding white, colored Gaussian noise and real muscle artifact noise at different SNR to some visually clean ECG signals from the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database. The proposed noise cancellation technique of ECG signal shows better signal to noise ratio (SNR) improvement, lesser mean square error (MSE) and percent of distortion (PRD) compared to other well-known methods.

N2  - In neonatal intensive care units, there is a need for continuous monitoring of sick  newborns with perinatal hypoxic ischemic brain injury (HIE). We assessed the utility of heart rate variability (HRV) in newborns with acute HIE undergoing simultaneous continuous EEG (cEEG) and ECG monitoring. HIE was classified using clinical criteria as well as visual grading of cEEG. Newborns were divided into two groups depending on the severity of the hypoxic injury and outcome. Various HRV parameters were compared between these groups, and significantly decreased HRV was found in neonates with severe HIE. As HRV is affected by many factors, it is difficult to attribute this difference solely to HIE. However, this study suggests that further investigation of HRV as a monitoring tool for acute neonatal hypoxic injury is warranted.

N2  - Accurate automatic noninvasive assessment of blood pressure (BP) presents a  challenge due to conditions like arrhythmias, obesity, and postural changes that tend to obfuscate arterial amplitude pulsations sensed by the cuff. Researchers tried to overcome this challenge by analyzing oscillometric pulses with the aid of a higher fidelity signal-the electrocardiogram (ECG). Moreover, pulse transit time (PTT) was employed to provide an additional method for BP estimation. However, these methods were not fully developed, suitably integrated, or tested. To address these issues, we present a novel method whereby ECG-assisted oscillometric and PTT (measured between ECG R-peaks and maximum slope of arterial pulse peaks) analyses are seamlessly integrated into the oscillometric BP measurement paradigm. The method bolsters oscillometric analysis (amplitude modulation) with more reliable ECG R-peaks provides a complementary measure with PTT analysis (temporal modulation) and fuses this information for robust BP estimation. We have integrated this technology into a prototype that comprises a BP cuff with an embedded conductive fabric ECG electrode, associated hardware, and algorithms. A pilot study has been undertaken on ten healthy subjects (150 recordings) to validate the performance of our prototype against United States Food and Drug Administration approved Omron oscillometric monitor (HEM-790IT). Our prototype achieves mean absolute difference of less than 5 mmHg and grade A as per the British Hypertension Society protocol for estimating BP, with the reference Omron monitor.

N2  - In recent years there has been an increasing number of papers in the literature,  applying the methods and techniques of Nonlinear Dynamics to the time series of electrical activity in normal electrocardiograms (ECGs) of various human subjects. Most of these studies are based primarily on correlation dimension estimates, and conclude that the dynamics of the ECG signal is deterministic and occurs on a chaotic attractor, whose dimension can distinguish between healthy and severely malfunctioning cases. In this paper, we first demonstrate that correlation dimension calculations must be used with care, as they do not always yield reliable estimates of the attractor's "dimension." We then carry out a number of additional tests (time differencing, smoothing, principal component analysis, surrogate data analysis, etc.) on the ECGs of three "normal" subjects and three "heavy smokers" at rest and after mild exercising, whose cardiac rhythms look very similar. Our main conclusion is that no major dynamical differences are evident in these signals. A preliminary estimate of three to four basic variables governing the dynamics (based on correlation dimension calculations) is updated to five to six, when temporal correlations between points are removed. Finally, in almost all cases, the transition between resting and mild exercising seems to imply a small increase in the complexity of cardiac dynamics. (c) 1995 American Institute of Physics.

N2  - Magnetocardiography provides a new, alternative method for fetal surveillance. This  method allows the registration of changes in the magnetic field produced by the fetal cardiac system. In comparison to fetal ECG, the fetal magnetocardiogram (fMCG) is not affected by intermediate tissue, in particular by the insulating effect of the vernix caseosa. Furthermore fMCG's with a good signal noise ratio can be obtained in the second trimester. A multichannel biomagnetometer allows the non-invasive measurement of the magnetic signals produced by the fetus. Examples of dta and evaluation techniques are given. Signal processing software allows the identification of all fetal beats in a data set, permitting the calculation of an averaged beat and the evaluation of signal morphology and cardiac time intervals. Furthermore it is possible to produce a beat to beat time series with high temporal resolution, making the evaluation of heart rate variability with measures from the time, frequency, and phase domain accessible. Particularly the latter are of interest in investigating changes in temporal complexity of the fetal cardiac system. Magnetocardiography thus holds the promise of improved antenatal surveillance as of the second trimester.

N2  - We propose the method to compute the nonlinear parameters of heart rhythm  (correlation dimension D₂ and correlation entropy K₂) using 5-minute ECG recordings preferred for screening of population. Conversion of RR intervals' time series into continuous function x(t) allows getting the new time series with different sampling rate dt. It has been shown that for all dt (250, 200, 125, and 100 ms) the cross-plots of D₂ and K₂ against embedding dimension m for phase-space reconstruction start to level off at m = 9. The sample size N at different sampling rates varied from 1200 at dt = 250 ms to 3000 at dt = 100 ms. Along with, the D₂ and K₂ means were not statistically different; that is, the sampling rate did not influence the results. We tested the feasibility of the method in two models: nonlinear heart rhythm dynamics in different states of autonomous nervous system and age-related characteristics of nonlinear parameters. According to the acquired data, the heart rhythm is more complex in childhood and adolescence with more influential parasympathetic influence against the background of elevated activity of sympathetic autonomous nervous system.

N2  - A hidden Markov model (HMM) of electrocardiogram (ECG) signal is presented for  detection of myocardial ischemia. The time domain signals that are recorded by the ECG before and during the episode of local ischemia were pre-processed to produce input sequences, which is needed for the model training. The model is also verified by test data, and the results show that the models have certain function for the detection of myocardial ischemia. The algorithm based on HMM provides a possible approach for the timely, rapid and automatic diagnosis of myocardial ischemia, and also can be used in portable medical diagnostic equipment in the future.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Based on the theory of probability and not equiprobable entropy ratios  in the context of dynamical systems theory, a methodology for cardiac dynamic evaluation was developed. OBJECTIVES: To confirm the clinical applicability of the diagnostic methodology based on probability and entropy for patients with different types of arrhythmia assessing the degree of intensification in the ICU through its characteristic proportions. METHODS: 80 Holter records from ICU diagnosed with arrhythmia and 20 normal were analyzed. Holter clinical findings were masked and were taken from them the maximum and minimum values of heart rate and total number of beats per minute to build the numerical attractor for each dynamics. Probability, entropy, S/k ratio, and proportions of entropy were evaluated, establishing its mathematical diagnosis and quantifying its severity level. RESULTS: It was shown that the methodology difference in all cases normal of abnormal dynamics, obtaining a sensitivity and specificity of 100 % and Kappa coefficient of 1, showing that it is also possible to establish quantitatively the degree of exacerbation. CONCLUSIONS: The methodology developed is useful in clinical practice to correlate the severity of arrhythmias with physical and mathematical predictions of exacerbation.

N2  - A new non-invasive continuous cardiac output (esCCO) monitoring system solely  utilizing a routine cardiovascular monitor was developed, even though a reference cardiac output (CO) is consistently required. Subsequently, a non-invasive patient information CO calibration together with a new automated exclusion algorithm was implemented in the esCCO system. We evaluated the accuracy and trending ability of the new esCCO system. Either operative or postoperative data of a multicenter study in Japan for evaluation of the accuracy of the original version of esCCO system were used to develop the new esCCO system. A total of 207 patients, mostly cardiac surgical patients, were enrolled in the study. Data were manually reviewed to formulate a new automated exclusion algorithm with enhanced accuracy. Then, a new esCCO system based on a patient information calibration together with the automated exclusion algorithm was developed. CO measured with a new esCCO system was compared with the corresponding intermittent bolus thermodilution CO (ICO) utilizing statistical methods including polar plots analysis. A total of 465 sets of CO data obtained using the new esCCO system were evaluated. The difference in the CO value between the new esCCO and ICO was 0.34 ± 1.50 (SD) L/min (95 % confidence limits of -2.60 to 3.28 L/min). The percentage error was 69.6 %. Polar plots analysis showed that the mean polar angle was -1.6° and radial limits of agreement were ±53.3°. This study demonstrates that the patient information calibration is clinically useful as ICO, but trending ability of the new esCCO system is not clinically acceptable as judged by percentage error and polar plots analysis, even though it's trending ability is comparable with currently available arterial waveform analysis methods.

N2  - A wearable armband electrocardiogram (ECG) monitor has been used for daily life  monitoring. The armband records three ECG channels, one electromyogram (EMG) channel, and tri-axial accelerometer signals. Contrary to conventional Holter monitors, the armband-based ECG device is convenient for long-term daily life monitoring because it uses no obstructive leads and has dry electrodes (no hydrogels), which do not cause skin irritation even after a few days. Principal component analysis (PCA) and normalized least mean squares (NLMS) adaptive filtering were used to reduce the EMG noise from the ECG channels. An artifact detector and an optimal channel selector were developed based on a support vector machine (SVM) classifier with a radial basis function (RBF) kernel using features that are related to the ECG signal quality. Mean HR was estimated from the 24-hour armband recordings from 16 volunteers in segments of 10 seconds each. In addition, four classical HR variability (HRV) parameters (SDNN, RMSSD, and powers at low and high frequency bands) were computed. For comparison purposes, the same parameters were estimated also for data from a commercial Holter monitor. The armband provided usable data (difference less than 10% from Holter-estimated mean HR) during 75.25%/11.02% (inter-subject median/interquartile range) of segments when the user was not in bed, and during 98.49%/0.79% of the bed segments. The automatic artifact detector found 53.85%/17.09% of the data to be usable during the non-bed time, and 95.00%/2.35% to be usable during the time in bed. The HRV analysis obtained a relative error with respect to the Holter data not higher than 1.37% (inter-subject median/interquartile range). Although further studies have to be conducted for specific applications, results suggest that the armband device has a good potential for daily life HR monitoring, especially for applications such as arrhythmia or seizure detection, stress assessment, or sleep studies.

N2  - The amount of coronary artery calcification (CAC) quantified in computed tomography  (CT) scans enables prediction of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. However, interscan variability of CAC quantification is high, especially in scans made without ECG synchronization. We propose a method for automatic detection of CACs that are severely affected by cardiac motion. Subsequently, we evaluate the impact of such CACs on CAC quantification and CVD risk determination. This study includes 1000 baseline and 585 one-year follow-up low-dose chest CTs from the National Lung Screening Trial. About 415 baseline scans are used to train and evaluate a convolutional neural network that identifies observer determined CACs affected by severe motion artifacts. Therefore, 585 paired scans acquired at baseline and follow-up were used to evaluate the impact of severe motion artifacts on CAC quantification and risk categorization. Based on the CAC amount, the scans were categorized into four standard CVD risk categories. The method identified CACs affected by severe motion artifacts with 85.2% accuracy. Moreover, reproducibility of CAC scores in scan pairs is higher in scans containing mostly CACs not affected by severe cardiac motion. Hence, the proposed method enables identification of scans affected by severe cardiac motion, where CAC quantification may not be reproducible.

N2  - Previous studies have proposed varying causes for idiopathic sudden sensorineural  hearing loss (SSNHL), including vascular occlusion, ruptured inner ear membrane, acoustic tumours and circulatory disturbances in the inner ear. The objective of this study was to characterise the autonomic regulation in 19 SSNHL patients in comparison to 19 healthy age-gender matched normal-hearing control subjects (CON) in order to improve the diagnostics of vascular caused hearing loss in SSNHL patients. A high-resolution short-term electrocardiogram (ECG) and the continuous noninvasive blood pressure signal were simultaneously recorded under resting conditions (30min). Linear and nonlinear indices of heart rate- and blood pressure variability (HRV, BPV) were calculated to characterise autonomic regulation. The results showed that HRV analysis did not produce significantly different results between SSNHL and CON, whereas linear and nonlinear BPV indices showed significant differences between both groups (p<0.01). This study was the first to show an altered cardiovascular regulation in SSNHL patients when compared to CON subjects, based on continuous blood pressure analysis. This was characterised by reduced variability, complexity and dynamics of blood pressure time series in SSNHL. These findings may contribute to an improved classification of the controversially discussed causes of SSNHL and, in addition, may lead to improved diagnostic strategies for a subgroup of SSNHL patients whose hearing loss is caused by cardiovascular factors.

N2  - In this article we study the application of nonlinear indices (sometimes called  complexity indices) to univariate time series data arising from studies of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Specifically, we consider time series arising from EEG studies, ECG studies, and self-report mood data. As part of our analysis, we empirically examine the claim in the literature that complexity tends to be higher in the EEG of schizophrenia patients than controls and that this tendency is dampened or even inverted by medication, increasing age, and reduced symptomatology. Our conclusion is that this claim is only partially supported and propose that symptomatology, specifically the presence or absence of schizophrenia 'deficit syndrome,' may be the most important factor. Results are more consistent in ECG studies in which reduced heart rate complexity is observed in both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. The applications of nonlinear indices to the effects of antipsychotic medication and the discrimination of mood states are also examined. It is concluded that the monitoring of nonlinear indices may be useful in predicting response to medication and predicting onset of specific mood states.

N2  - Rhythm annotation of out-of-hospital cardiac episodes (OHCA) is key for a better  understanding of the interplay between resuscitation therapy and OHCA patient outcome. OHCA rhythms are classified in five categories, asystole (AS), pulseless electrical activity (PEA), pulsed rhythms (PR), ventricular fibrillation (VF) and ventricular tachycardia (VT). Manual OHCA annotation by expert clinicians is onerous and time consuming, so there is a need for accurate and automatic OHCA rhythm annotation methods. For this study 852 OHCA episodes of patients treated with Automated External Defibrillators (AED) by the Emergency Medical Services of the Basque Country were analyzed. Six expert clinicians reviewed the electrocardiogram (ECG) of 4214 AED rhythm analyses and annotated the rhythm. Their consensus decision was used as ground truth. There were a total of 2418 AS, 294 PR, 1008 PEA, 472 VF and 22 VT. The ECG analysis intervals were extracted and used to develop an automatic rhythm annotator. Data was partitioned patient-wise into training (70%) and test (30%). Performance was evaluated in terms of per class sensitivity (Se) and F-score (F1). The unweighted mean of sensitivity (UMS) and F-score were used as global performance metrics. The classification method is composed of a feature extraction and denoising stage based on the stationary wavelet transform of the ECG, and on a random forest classifier. The best model presented a per rhythm Se/F1 of 95.8/95.7, 43.3/52.2, 85.3/81.3, 94.2/96.1, 81.9/72.2 for AS, PR, PEA, VF and VT, respectively. The UMS for the test set was 80.2%, 2-points above that of previous solutions. This method could be used to retrospectively annotate large OHCA datasets and ameliorate the workload of manual OHCA rhythm annotation.

N2  - Electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring allows temporal analysis of cardiac rhythm. We  are usually interested in the variability of two components of the ECG: RR interval (a surrogate marker of cardiac interval) and QT interval (the duration of ventricular depolarization/repolarization). Quantification of RR rhythm, called heart rate variability (HRV) analysis, reflects the cardiac influences of the autonomic nervous system. QT variability provides insight regarding the risk of ventricular arrhythmia, and is at least partially independent of HRV. In this review, we consider the analysis of ECG time series during physical exercise. Our objectives were to show the variety of methods that can be used to characterize these time series data and to demonstrate "normal" changes in these characteristics during exercise and recovery. Attaining a comprehensive understanding of cardiac electrical conduction changes during exercise is not straightforward: analysis methods are numerous and results require careful interpretation. However, we recommend that assessment of both HRV and QT properties yields the most valuable information, the utility of which can be appreciated from the viewpoints of the athlete (e.g. providing feedback on the cardiac effects of training), the clinician (assisting in cardiovascular screening and exercise therapy evaluation) and the exercise physiologist (providing data for physiological process modelling).

N2  - Uncovering of the atrial signal for patients undergoing episodes of atrial  fibrillation is usually obtained from surface ECG by removing waves induced by ventricular activities. Once earned the atrial signal, the detection of the dominant fibrillation frequency is often the main (and only) goal. In this work we verified if subtraction of the ventricular activity might be avoided by performing spectral analysis on those ECG segments where ventricular activity is absent, (i.e. the T-Q intervals). While the approach might seem crude, in here the question was recast into a problem of missing data in a long time series and proper methods were applied: the Lomb periodogram and the iterative Singular Spectrum Analysis. The two methods were tested on both simulated signals and "realistic" atrial signals constructed using the ECG recordings provided by the 2004 Computers in Cardiology competition. The results obtained showed that both techniques were able to provide a reliable quantification of the dominant oscillation, with a slightly superior performance of the iterative Singular Spectrum Analysis. Absolute errors larger than 1.0 Hz were unlikely (p < 0.05) up to 130-140 bpm. Such level of agreement is consistent with similar comparative works where techniques for separating the atrial signal from ventricular waves were considered.

N2  - Nowadays, cardiovascular diseases represent the most common cause of death in  western countries. Among various examination techniques, electrocardiography (ECG) is still a highly valuable tool used for the diagnosis of many cardiovascular disorders. In order to diagnose a person based on ECG, cardiologists can use automatic diagnostic algorithms. Research in this area is still necessary. In order to compare various algorithms correctly, it is necessary to test them on standard annotated databases, such as the Common Standards for Quantitative Electrocardiography (CSE) database. According to Scopus, the CSE database is the second most cited standard database. There were two main objectives in this work. First, new diagnoses were added to the CSE database, which extended its original annotations. Second, new recommendations for diagnostic software quality estimation were established. The ECG recordings were diagnosed by five new cardiologists independently, and in total, 59 different diagnoses were found. Such a large number of diagnoses is unique, even in terms of standard databases. Based on the cardiologists' diagnoses, a four-round consensus (4R consensus) was established. Such a 4R consensus means a correct final diagnosis, which should ideally be the output of any tested classification software. The accuracy of the cardiologists' diagnoses compared with the 4R consensus was the basis for the establishment of accuracy recommendations. The accuracy was determined in terms of sensitivity = 79.20-86.81%, positive predictive value = 79.10-87.11%, and the Jaccard coefficient = 72.21-81.14%, respectively. Within these ranges, the accuracy of the software is comparable with the accuracy of cardiologists. The accuracy quantification of the correct classification is unique. Diagnostic software developers can objectively evaluate the success of their algorithm and promote its further development. The annotations and recommendations proposed in this work will allow for faster development and testing of classification software. As a result, this might facilitate cardiologists' work and lead to faster diagnoses and earlier treatment.

N2  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The extensive use of electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings  during experimental protocols using small rodents requires an automatic delineation technique in the ECG with high performance. It has been shown that the wavelet transform (WT) based ECG delineator is a suitable tool to delineate electrocardiographic waveforms. The aim of this work is to implement and evaluate the ECG waves delineation in Wistar rats applying WT. We also describe the ECG signal of the Wistar rats giving the characteristics of its spectrum among other useful information. METHODS: We evaluated a delineator based on WT in a Wistar rat electrocardiograms database which was annotated manually by experienced observers. RESULTS: The delineation showed an "overall performance" such as sensitivity and a positive predictive value of 99.2% and 83.9% for P-wave, 100% and 99.9% for QRS complex, and 100% and 99.8% for T-wave, respectively. We also compared temporal analysis based ECG delineator with the WT based ECG delineator in RR interval, QRS duration, QT interval, and T-wave peak-to-end duration. The results showed that WT outperforms the temporal delineation technique in all parameters analyzed. CONCLUSIONS: Finally, we propose a WT based ECG delineator as a methodology to implement in a wide diversity of experimental ECG analyses using Wistar rats.

N2  - We present a study on the feasibility of the automatic detection of atrial  fibrillation (AF) from cardiac vibration signals (ballistocardiograms/BCGs) recorded by unobtrusive bedmounted sensors. The proposed system is intended as a screening and monitoring tool in home-healthcare applications and not as a replacement for ECG-based methods used in clinical environments. Based on BCG data recorded in a study with 10 AF patients, we evaluate and rank seven popular machine learning algorithms (naive Bayes, linear and quadratic discriminant analysis, support vector machines, random forests as well as bagged and boosted trees) for their performance in separating 30 s long BCG epochs into one of three classes: sinus rhythm, atrial fibrillation, and artifact. For each algorithm, feature subsets of a set of statistical time-frequency-domain and time-domain features were selected based on the mutual information between features and class labels as well as first- and second-order interactions among features. The classifiers were evaluated on a set of 856 epochs by means of 10-fold cross-validation. The best algorithm (random forests) achieved a Matthews correlation coefficient, mean sensitivity, and mean specificity of 0.921, 0.938, and 0.982, respectively.

N2  - A novel method has been proposed for the detection of ischemia using an isoelectric  energy function (IEEF) resulting from ST segment deviations in ECG signals. The method consists of five stages: pre-processing, delineation, measurement of isoelectric energy, a beat characterization algorithm and detection of ischemia. The isoelectric energy threshold is used to differentiate ischemic beats from normal beats for ischemic episode detection. Then, ischemic episodes are classified as transmural or subendocardial. The method is validated for recordings of the annotated European ST-T database (EDB). The results show 98.12% average sensitivity (SE) and 98.16% average specificity (SP). These results are significantly better than those of existing methods cited in the literature. The advantage of the proposed method includes simplicity, ruggedness and automatic discarding of noisy beats.

N2  - Arrhythmia is a kind of common cardiac electrical activity abnormalities. Heartbeats  classification based on electrocardiogram(ECG) is of great significance for clinical diagnosis of arrhythmia. This paper proposes a feature extraction method based on manifold learning, neighborhood preserving embedding(NPE) algorithm, to achieve the automatic classification of arrhythmia heartbeats. With classification system, we obtained low dimensional manifold structure features of high dimensional ECG signals by NPE algorithm, then we inputted the feature vectors into support vector machine(SVM) classifier for heartbeats diagnosis. Based on MIT-BIH arrhythmia database, we clustered 14 classes of arrhythmia heartbeats in the experiment, which yielded a high overall classification accuracy of 98.51%. Experimental result showed that the proposed method was an effective classification method for arrhythmia heartbeats.

N2  - BACKGROUND: In this study, we propose a method for automatically predicting atrial  fibrillation (AF) based on convolutional neural network (CNN) using a short-term normal electrocardiogram (ECG) signal. METHODS: We designed a CNN model and optimized it by dropout and normalization. One-dimensional convolution, max-pooling, and fully-connected multiple perceptron were used to analyze the short-term normal ECG. The ECG signal was preprocessed and segmented to train and evaluate the proposed CNN model. The training and test sets consisted of the two AF and one normal dataset from the MIT-BIH database. RESULTS: The proposed CNN model for the automatic prediction of AF achieved a high performance with a sensitivity of 98.6%, a specificity of 98.7%, and an accuracy of 98.7%. CONCLUSION: The results show the possibility of automatically predicting AF based on the CNN model using a short-term normal ECG signal. The proposed CNN model for the automatic prediction of AF can be a helpful tool for the early diagnosis of AF in healthcare fields.

N2  - RR-interval sequences (tachograms) represent heart rate variability discretely. When  time series representations of instantaneous heart rate (IHR) are required, tachograms are often resampled into a time series. This paper demonstrates that traditional RR-interval resampling is often inconsistent with the time domain constraints of the tachogram. A general technique, called frequency-modulated phase-interpolation (FMPI), is presented that preserves the time domain constraints. Results of FMPI in the synthesis of ECG signals with accurate event-interval reconstruction are shown. Discussion of the model against IPFM and the heart timing signal is presented. Consequences of the IHR reconstruction perspective to the spectral characterization of heart rate variability are also introduced.

N2  - The heart begins to beat before the brain is formed. Whether conventional  hierarchical central commands sent by the brain to the heart alone explain all the interplay between these two organs should be reconsidered. Here, we demonstrate correlations between the signal complexity of brain and cardiac activity. Eighty-seven geriatric outpatients with healthy hearts and varied cognitive abilities each provided a 24-hour electrocardiography (ECG) and a 19-channel eye-closed routine electroencephalography (EEG). Multiscale entropy (MSE) analysis was applied to three epochs (resting-awake state, photic stimulation of fast frequencies (fast-PS), and photic stimulation of slow frequencies (slow-PS)) of EEG in the 1-58 Hz frequency range, and three RR interval (RRI) time series (awake-state, sleep and that concomitant with the EEG) for each subject. The low-to-high frequency power (LF/HF) ratio of RRI was calculated to represent sympatho-vagal balance. With statistics after Bonferroni corrections, we found that: (a) the summed MSE value on coarse scales of the awake RRI (scales 11-20, RRI-MSE-coarse) were inversely correlated with the summed MSE value on coarse scales of the resting-awake EEG (scales 6-20, EEG-MSE-coarse) at Fp2, C4, T6 and T4; (b) the awake RRI-MSE-coarse was inversely correlated with the fast-PS EEG-MSE-coarse at O1, O2 and C4; (c) the sleep RRI-MSE-coarse was inversely correlated with the slow-PS EEG-MSE-coarse at Fp2; (d) the RRI-MSE-coarse and LF/HF ratio of the awake RRI were correlated positively to each other; (e) the EEG-MSE-coarse at F8 was proportional to the cognitive test score; (f) the results conform to the cholinergic hypothesis which states that cognitive impairment causes reduction in vagal cardiac modulation; (g) fast-PS significantly lowered the EEG-MSE-coarse globally. Whether these heart-brain correlations could be fully explained by the central autonomic network is unknown and needs further exploration.

N2  - The needs for light-weight and soft smart clothing in homecare have been rising  since the past decade. Many smart textile sensors have been developed and applied to automatic physiological and user-centered environmental status recognition. In the present study, we propose wearable multi-sensor smart clothing for homecare monitoring based on an economic fabric electrode with high elasticity and low resistance. The wearable smart clothing integrated with heterogeneous sensors is capable to measure multiple human biosignals (ECG and respiration), acceleration, and gyro information. Five independent respiratory signals (electric impedance plethysmography, respiratory induced frequency variation, respiratory induced amplitude variation, respiratory induced intensity variation, and respiratory induced movement variation) are obtained. The smart clothing can provide accurate respiratory rate estimation by using three different techniques (Naïve Bayes inference, static Kalman filter, and dynamic Kalman filter). During the static sitting experiments, respiratory induced frequency variation has the best performance; whereas during the running experiments, respiratory induced amplitude variation has the best performance. The Naïve Bayes inference and dynamic Kalman filter have shown good results. The novel smart clothing is soft, elastic, and washable and it is suitable for long-term monitoring in homecare medical service and healthcare industry.

N2  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: . The electrocardiograms (ECGs) are widely used to  diagnose a variety of arrhythmias. Generally, the abnormalities of ECG signals mainly consist of ill-shaped ECG beat morphologies and irregular intervals. The ill-shaped ECG beat morphologies represent morphological information, while the irregular intervals denote the temporal information of ECG signals. But it is difficult to utilize morphological information and temporal information simultaneously when dealing with single ECG heartbeats, because RR interval is not contained in a single short heartbeat. Therefore, to handle this problems, a novel Multi-information Fusion Convolutional Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Network (MF-CBRNN) is proposed for arrhythmia automatic detection. METHODS: . The MF-CBRNN is designed with two parallel hybrid branches that can simultaneously focus on the beat-based information in the ECG beats and the segment-based information in the adjacent segments of the beats. A single ECG beat provides the morphological information. At the same time, the adjacent segment of the ECG beat enriches the temporal information, so the two branches are designed to exploit the multiple information contained in ECGs. Furthermore, a combination of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and a bidirectional long short memory (BLSTM) in each branch is utilized to capture the information from the two inputs. And all the features extracted from the two branches are fused for information aggregation. RESULTS: . To evaluate the performance of the proposed model, the ECG signals from MIT-BIH databases are used for intra-patient and inter-patient paradigms. The proposed model yields an accuracy of 99.56% and an F1-score of 96.40% under the intra-patient paradigm. And it obtains an overall accuracy of 96.77% and F1-score of 77.83% under the inter-patient paradigm. CONCLUSIONS: . Compared with other studies on arrhythmia detection, our method achieves a state-of-the-art performance. It indicates that the proposed model is a promising arrhythmia detection algorithm for computer-aided diagnostic systems.

N2  - Accurate R peak detection in the electrocardiogram (ECG) is a well-known and highly  explored problem in biomedical signal processing. Although a lot of progress has been made in this area, current methods are still insufficient in the presence of extreme noise and/or artifacts such as loose electrodes. Often, however, not only the ECG is recorded, but multiple signals are simultaneously acquired from the patient. Several of these signals, such as blood pressure, can help to improve the heart beat detection. These signals of interest can be detected automatically by analyzing their power spectral density or by using the available signal type identifiers. Individual peaks from the signals of interest are combined using majority voting, heart beat location estimation and Hjorth's mobility of the resulting RR intervals. Both multimodal algorithms showed significant increases in performance of up to 8.65% for noisy multimodal datasets compared to when only the ECG signal is used. A maximal performance of 90.02% was obtained on the hidden test set of the Physionet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2014: Robust Detection of Heart Beats in Multimodal Data.

N2  - Electrocardiogram (ECG) classification is an important process in identifying  arrhythmia, and neural network models have been widely used in this field. However, these models are often disrupted by heartbeat noise and are negatively affected by skewed data. To address these problems, a novel heartbeat recognition method is presented. The aim of this study is to apply a principal component analysis network (PCANet) for feature extraction based on a noisy ECG signal. To improve the classification speed, a linear support vector machine (SVM) was applied. In our experiments, we identified five types of imbalanced original and noise-free ECGs in the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database to verify the effectiveness of our algorithm and achieved 97.77% and 97.08% accuracy, respectively. The results show that our method has high recognition accuracy in the classification of skewed and noisy heartbeats, indicating that our method is a practical ECG recognition method with suitable noise robustness and skewed data applicability.

N2  - The detection and delineation of QRS-complexes and T-waves in electrocardiogram  (ECG) is an important task because these features are associated with the cardiac abnormalities including ventricular arrhythmias that may lead to sudden cardiac death. In this paper, we propose a novel method for the R-peak and the T-peak detection using hierarchical clustering and discrete wavelet transform (DWT) from the ECG signal. In the first step, a template of the single ECG beat is identified. Secondly, all R-peaks are detected by using hierarchical clustering. Then, each corresponding T-wave boundary is delineated based on the template morphology. Finally, the determination of T wave peaks is achieved based on the modulus-maxima analysis (MMA) of the DWT coefficients. We evaluated the algorithm by using all records from the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database and QT database. The R-peak detector achieved a sensitivity of 99.89%, a positive predictivity of 99.97% and 99.83% accuracy over the validation MIT-BIH database. In addition, it shows a sensitivity of 100%, a positive predictivity of 99.83% in manually annotated QT database. It also shows 99.92% sensitivity and 99.96% positive predictivity over the automatic annotated QT database. In terms of the T-peak detection, our algorithm is verified with 99.91% sensitivity and 99.38% positive predictivity in manually annotated QT database.

N2  - Atrial fibrillation (AF) affects three to five million Americans and is associated  with significant morbidity and mortality. Existing methods to diagnose this paroxysmal arrhythmia are cumbersome and/or expensive. We hypothesized that an iPhone 4S can be used to detect AF based on its ability to record a pulsatile photoplethysmogram signal from a fingertip using the built-in camera lens. To investigate the capability of the iPhone 4S for AF detection, we first used two databases, the MIT-BIH AF and normal sinus rhythm (NSR) to derive discriminatory threshold values between two rhythms. Both databases include RR time series originating from 250 Hz sampled ECG recordings. We rescaled the RR time series to 30 Hz so that the RR time series resolution is 1/30 (s) which is equivalent to the resolution from an iPhone 4S. We investigated three statistical methods consisting of the root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD), the Shannon entropy (ShE) and the sample entropy (SampE), which have been proved to be useful tools for AF assessment. Using 64-beat segments from the MIT-BIH databases, we found the beat-to-beat accuracy value of 0.9405, 0.9300, and 0.9614 for RMSSD, ShE, and SampE, respectively. Using an iPhone 4S, we collected 2-min pulsatile time series from 25 prospectively recruited subjects with AF pre- and postelectrical cardioversion. Using derived threshold values of RMSSD, ShE and SampE from the MIT-BIH databases, we found the beat-to-beat accuracy of 0.9844, 0.8494, and 0.9522, respectively. It should be recognized that for clinical applications, the most relevant objective is to detect the presence of AF in the data. Using this criterion, we achieved an accuracy of 100% for both the MIT-BIH AF and iPhone 4S databases.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To develop and evaluate an algorithm for the selection of the  best-performing QRS detections from multiple algorithms and ECG leads. APPROACH: The detections produced by several publicly available single-lead QRS detectors are segmented in 20 s consecutive windows; then a statistical model is trained to estimate a quality metric that is used to rank each 20 s segment of detections. The model describes each heartbeat in terms of six features calculated from the RR interval series, and one feature proportional to the number of heartbeats detected in other leads in a neighborhood of the current heartbeat. With the highest ranked segments, we defined several lead selection strategies (LSS) that were evaluated in a set of 1754 ECG recordings from 14 ECG databases. The LSS proposed were compared with simple strategies such as selecting lead II or the first lead available in a recording. The performance was calculated in terms of the average sensitivity, positive predictive value, and F score. MAIN RESULTS: The best-performing LSS, based on wavedet algorithm, achieved an F score of 98.7, with sensitivity S  =  99.2 and positive predictive value P  =  98.3. The F score for the simpler strategy using the same algorithm was 92.7. The LSS studied in this work have been made available in an open-source toolbox to ease the reproducibility and result comparison. SIGNIFICANCE: The results suggest that the use of LSS is convenient for purposes of selecting the best heartbeat locations among those provided by different detectors in different leads, obtaining better results than any of the algorithms individually.

N2  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Heartbeats Holter monitoring is important for the  detection of arrhythmias and possible anomalies, which are predictive of cardiovascular risks and infections. Reducing the number of acquired samples is useful to save energy and memory, but a proper down-sampling schedule is needed to record all useful information. Method An adaptive algorithm for the non-uniform down-sampling of data is used to reduce the mean sampling frequency of ECG data. The acquired data are processed to extract RR rhythm and to classify the heartbeats among a set of possible types of arrhythmias. RESULTS: The proposed method is tested in terms of the ability to estimate the heart rate and to classify the heartbeats from the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia data down-sampled below the Nyquist limit. The mean accuracy in identifying the heartbeats was over the 98% and the RMS error in estimating the RR time series was lower than the 1%. Variability, spectral and complexity indexes extracted from RR series were estimated with a mean error that was lower than 10%. Classification accuracy was above the 95%. CONCLUSIONS: An adaptive method to down-sample ECG data is discussed. It can be useful to save energy and to reduce memory occupation, while still preserving important information on the heartbeats.

N2  - We present a novel framework for analyzing univariate time series data. At the heart  of the approach is a versatile algorithm for measuring the similarity of two segments of time series called geometric template matching (GeTeM). First, we use GeTeM to compute a similarity measure for clustering and nearest-neighbor classification. Next, we present a semi-supervised learning algorithm that uses the similarity measure with hierarchical clustering in order to improve classification performance when unlabeled training data are available. Finally, we present a boosting framework called TDEBOOST, which uses an ensemble of GeTeM classifiers. TDEBOOST augments the traditional boosting approach with an additional step in which the features used as inputs to the classifier are adapted at each step to improve the training error. We empirically evaluate the proposed approaches on several datasets, such as accelerometer data collected from wearable sensors and ECG data.

N2  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Early neonatal death is a worldwide challenge with 1  million newborn deaths every year. The primary cause of these deaths are complications during labour and birth asphyxia. The majority of these newborns could have been saved with adequate resuscitation at birth. Newborn resuscitation guidelines recommend immediate drying, stimulation, suctioning if indicated, and ventilation of non-breathing newborns. A system that will automatically detect and extract time periods where different resuscitation activities are performed, would be highly beneficial to evaluate what resuscitation activities that are improving the state of the newborn, and if current guidelines are good and if they are followed. The potential effects of especially stimulation are not very well documented as it has been difficult to investigate through observations. In this paper the main objective is to identify stimulation activities, regardless if the state of the newborn is changed or not, and produce timelines of the resuscitation episode with the identified stimulations. METHODS: Data is collected by utilizing a new heart rate device, NeoBeat, with dry-electrode ECG and accelerometer sensors placed on the abdomen of the newborn. We propose a method, NBstim, based on time domain and frequency domain features from the accelerometer signals and ECG signals from NeoBeat, to detect time periods of stimulation. NBstim use causal features from a gliding window of the signals, thus it can potentially be used in future realtime systems. A high performing feature subset is found using feature selection. System performance is computed using a leave-one-out cross-validation and compared with manual annotations. RESULTS: The system achieves an overall accuracy of 90.3% when identifying regions with stimulation activities. CONCLUSION: The performance indicates that the proposed NBstim, used with signals from the NeoBeat can be used to determine when stimulation is performed. The provided activity timelines, in combination with the status of the newborn, for example the heart rate, at different time points, can be studied further to investigate both the time spent and the effect of different newborn resuscitation parameters.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is common and may have severe consequences.  Continuous long-term electrocardiogram (ECG) is widely used for AF screening. Recently, commercial ECG analysis software was launched, which automatically detects AF in long-term ECGs. It has been claimed that such tools offer reliable AF screening and save time for ECG analysis. However, this has not been investigated in a real-life patient cohort. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the performance of automatic software-based screening for AF in long-term ECGs. METHODS: Two independent physicians manually screened 22,601 hours of continuous long-term ECGs from 150 patients for AF. Presence, number, and duration of AF episodes were registered. Subsequently, the recordings were screened for AF by an established ECG analysis software (Pathfinder SL), and its performance was validated against the thorough manual analysis (gold standard). RESULTS: Sensitivity and specificity for AF detection was 98.5% (95% confidence interval 91.72%-99.96%) and 80.21% (95% confidence interval 70.83%-87.64%), respectively. Software-based AF detection was inferior to manual analysis by physicians (P < .0001). Median AF duration was underestimated (19.4 hours vs 22.1 hours; P < .001) and median number of AF episodes was overestimated (32 episodes vs 2 episodes; P < .001) by the software. In comparison to extensive quantitative manual ECG analysis, software-based analysis saved time (2 minutes vs 19 minutes; P < .001). CONCLUSION: Owing to its high sensitivity and ability to save time, software-based ECG analysis may be used as a screening tool for AF. An additional manual confirmatory analysis may be required to reduce the number of false-positive findings.

N2  - Camera-based measurement of the blood volume pulse via non-contact, imaging  photoplethysmography is a very popular approach for measuring pulse rate using a remote imaging sensor. Comparatively less attention has been paid to the usefulness of the method for measuring features of pulse rate variability, and even less focus has been put on the accuracy of any cardiac activity feature that can be achieved at long imager-to-subject distances. In this study, video was recorded from 19 participants, while at rest, at a distance of 25 meters from the imaging sensor. A digital camera was used to record video while cardiovascular measures of both electrical and optical physiological ground truth were recorded. Pulse rate data obtained from the imager using a common blind source separation and periodogram approach were compared to physiological ground truth signals. The quality of the recovered blood volume pulse morphology was sufficient to calculate time-domain measures of pulse rate using inter-pulse interval (IPI) time series. Following this, several features of pulse rate variability were calculated from the IPI time series and compared to those calculated from the corresponding physiological ground truth signals. Use of the time-domain data as compared to the periodogram approach to measure pulse rate reduced the error in the estimate from 1.6 to 0.2 beats per minute. Correlation analysis (r2) between the camera-based measures of pulse rate variability and ECG-derived heart rate variability ranged from 0.779 to 0.973; these results are of comparable outcome to those obtained at imager-to-subject distances of no more than 3 meters. This study demonstrates that pulse rates of less than one beat-per-minute error can be obtained when the recovered blood volume pulse morphology is of adequate quality to resolve systolic onsets for individual cardiac cycles. Further, this approach can yield data of very promising quality for estimating measures of pulse rate variability.

N2  - Electroanatomical mapping (EAM) systems are commonly used in clinical practice for  guiding catheter ablation treatments of common arrhythmias. In focal tachycardias, the ablation target is defined by locating the earliest activation area determined by the joint analysis of electrogram (EGM) signals at different sites. However, this is currently a manual time-consuming and experience-dependent task performed during the intervention and thus prone to stress-related errors. In this paper, we present an automatic delineation strategy that combines electrocardiogram (ECG) information with the wavelet decomposition of the EGM signal envelope to identify the onset of each EGM signal for activation mapping. Fourteen electroanatomical maps corresponding to ten patients suffering from non-tolerated premature ventricular contraction (PVC) beats and admitted for ablation procedure were used for evaluation. We compared the results obtained automatically with two types of manual annotations: one during the intervention by an expert technician (on-procedure) and other after the intervention (off-procedure), free from time and procedural constraints, by two other technicians. The automatic annotations show a significant correlation (0.95, p 0.01) with the evaluation reference (off-procedure annotation sets combination) and has an error of 2.1 ± 10.9 ms, around the order of magnitude of the on-procedure annotations error ( - 2.6 ± 6.8 ms). The results suggest that the proposed methodology could be incorporated into EAM systems to considerably reduce processing time during ablation interventions.

N2  - Automatic tracking of intra-beat cardiac activities in ballistocardiogram (BCG) is a  highly interesting yet technically challenging topic for cardiac monitoring, due to the signal's high susceptibility to various forms of distortions. In this paper, we aim to further investigate the BCG waveform detection from a signal processing and analysis viewpoint. We collect synchronized electrocardiography(ECG) and BCG recordings from four healthy human subjects using an in-house built multi-physiological monitoring device. Particularly, we study post-exercise ECG-BCG signals that embed considerable variation in the heart beat during the post-exercise recovery phase. Furthermore, we develop an efficient and interactive tool for detecting and marking ECG-BCG waveforms in each heart beat. Through analyzing the detected time interval signals, we explore new interesting patterns of dynamic associations between different time interval signals. At the same time, we call for development of improved detection algorithms to address robustness and accuracy issues.

N2  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Vital signs are usually recorded at 4-8 h intervals in  hospital patients, and deterioration between measurements can have serious consequences. The primary study objective was to assess agreement between a new ultra-low power, wireless and wearable surveillance system for continuous ambulatory monitoring of vital signs and a widely used clinical vital signs monitor. The secondary objective was to examine the system's ability to automatically identify and reject invalid physiological data. SETTING: Single hospital centre. PARTICIPANTS: Heart and respiratory rate were recorded over 2 h in 20 patients undergoing elective surgery and a second group of 41 patients with comorbid conditions, in the general ward. OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome measures were limits of agreement and bias. The secondary outcome measure was proportion of data rejected. RESULTS: The digital patch provided reliable heart rate values in the majority of patients (about 80%) with normal sinus rhythm, and in the presence of abnormal ECG recordings (excluding aperiodic arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation). The mean difference between systems was less than ±1 bpm in all patient groups studied. Although respiratory data were more frequently rejected as invalid because of the high sensitivity of impedance pneumography to motion artefacts, valid rates were reported for 50% of recordings with a mean difference of less than ±1 brpm compared with the bedside monitor. Correlation between systems was statistically significant (p<0.0001) for heart and respiratory rate, apart from respiratory rate in patients with atrial fibrillation (p=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Overall agreement between digital patch and clinical monitor was satisfactory, as was the efficacy of the system for automatic rejection of invalid data. Wireless monitoring technologies, such as the one tested, may offer clinical value when implemented as part of wider hospital systems that integrate and support existing clinical protocols and workflows.

N2  - Apple launched a novel feature of the Apple Watch (Apple Inc.) series 4 that enables  consumers to record a rhythm strip and assist with self-diagnosis of atrial fibrillation (AF). The watch is paired with an app that provides automatic classification of the rhythm. Ability of the algorithm to identify AF has received Food and Drug Administration clearance. Given increasing use of direct-to-consumer devices, important questions regarding the utilization of such devices and their features in clinical practice arise. It is unclear how the data obtained from these devices can be optimally incorporated in patient care and what it means for patients. Safety and security of using wearables are also of concern. Furthermore, whether data generated from the Electrocardiogram (ECG) feature will be beneficial to public health is to be determined. We discuss possible uses and challenges of Apple's (Apple Inc.) newly launched ECG feature and review an upcoming trial looking at clinical applications and outcomes using this technology. We also review the literature on the Kardia (AliveCor Inc.) mobile and smartwatch ECG technology and briefly discuss Apple Watch irregular heartbeat notifications along with the Apple Heart Study.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Noise, artifact, and labile morphology of ECGs collected from freely  moving animals in safety pharmacology studies render accurate measurements of QT interval challenging. Consequently, a high percentage of beats are uninterpretable and results provided by currently available analysis algorithms often require extensive manual review to correct errors. Performance of a novel algorithm, Multi-Domain Signal Processing™ (MDSP), is evaluated as a means of removing noise (denoising) without distorting morphology and for obtaining accurate beat-to-beat QT measurements. METHODS: Performance was evaluated using controlled experiments and an observational evaluation as follows: a) a clean ECG strip was intentionally corrupted with varying levels of noise to provide recordings of known signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). SNR and fidelity were compared pre- and post-MDSP denoising, b) beat-to-beat QT of a noisy ECG was measured manually pre- and post-MDSP denoising and automatically by MDSP, c) beat-to-beat QT of a clean ECG was measured manually and automatically using MDSP, and d) beat-to-beat QT was computed for 3 freely moving non-human primates (NHP) pre- and post-torsadogen administration and the impact of averaging on QTSD, QT/RR dynamics and relationship was evaluated. RESULTS: MDSP reduced noise amplitude by up to 85% while preserving signal morphology. Mean QTs for manual and automatic measurements on a noisy ECG were within 2±15ms. MDSP-denoising prior to manual QT measurements resulted in a 22% decrease in QTSD compared to measurements obtained without denoising. Average QT standard deviation of the mean (QTSD) for automatic MDSP-derived measurements for 3 freely moving subjects was 7ms with 2.5% of beats automatically excluded due to noise. DISCUSSION: This work demonstrates that the MDSP algorithm shows promise as a tool for providing accurate automatic beat-to-beat measurements of QT interval from NHP in safety pharmacology studies. A methodology is presented for characterizing the impact of noise on algorithm performance.

N2  - Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia encountered  in clinical practice. Radiofrequency catheter ablation (CA) is increasingly employed to treat this disease, yet the selection of persistent AF patients who will benefit from this treatment remains a challenging task. Several parameters of the surface electrocardiogram (ECG) have been analyzed in previous works to predict AF termination by CA, such as fibrillatory wave (f-wave) amplitude. However, they are usually manually computed and only a subset of electrodes is inspected. In this study, a novel perspective of the role of f-wave amplitude as a potential noninvasive predictor of CA outcome is adopted by exploring ECG interlead spatial variability. An automatic procedure for atrial amplitude computation based on cubic Hermite interpolation is first proposed. To describe the global f-wave peak-to-peak amplitude distribution, signal contributions from multiple leads are then combined by condensing the most representative features of the atrial signal in a reduced-rank approximation based on principal component analysis (PCA). We show that exploiting ECG spatial diversity by means of this PCA-based multilead approach does not only increase the robustness to electrode selection, but also substantially improves the predictive power of the amplitude parameter.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Reliable detection of return of spontaneous circulation with minimal  interruptions of chest compressions is part of high-quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and routinely done by checking pulsation of carotid arteries. However, manual palpation was time-consuming and unreliable even if performed by expert clinicians. Therefore, automated accurate pulse detection with minimal interruptions of chest compression is highly desirable during cardiac arrest especially in out-of-hospital settings. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether the acceleration (ACC) signals acquired from accelerometer-based CPR feedback sensor can be used to distinguish perfusing rhythm (PR) from pulseless electrical activity (PEA) in a porcine model of cardiac arrest. METHODS: Cardiac arrest was induced in 49 male adult pigs. ECG, arterial blood pressure (ABP) and ACC waveforms were simultaneously recorded during CPR. 3-second segments containing compression-free signals during chest compression pauses were extracted and only those segments with organized rhythm were used for analysis. PR was defined as systolic arterial pressure >60 mmHg and pulse pressure >10 mmHg, while PEA was defined as an organized rhythm that does not meet the above criteria for PR. Peak correlation coefficient (CCp) of the cross-correlation function between pre-processed ECG and ACC, was used to discriminate PR and PEA. RESULTS: 63 PR and 153 PEA were identified from the total of 1025 extracted segments. CCp was significantly higher for PR as compared to PEA (0.440±0.176 vs. 0.067±0.042, p<0.01) and highly correlated with ABP (r = 0.848, p<0.001). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were 0.965, 93.6%, 97.5% and 96.7% for the ACC-based automatic spontaneous pulse detection. CONCLUSIONS: In this animal model, the ACC signals acquired from an accelerometer-based CPR feedback sensor can be used to detect the presence of spontaneous pulse with high accuracy.

N2  - Geomagnetic variations of partly interplanetary origin, with cyclic signatures in  human affairs and pathology include the incidence of various diseases, regarding which this study of healthy subjects attempted to determine an underlying mechanism by worldwide archival and physiological monitoring, notably of heart rate variability (HRV). In the past half-century, the possible health and other hazards of natural, solar variability-driven temporal variations in the earth's magnetic field have become a controversial subject in view of the inconsistent results. Some well-documented claims of associations between geomagnetic storms and myocardial infarction or stroke have been rejected by a study based on more comprehensive data analyzed by rigorous methods - covering, however, only part of a solar cycle in only part of a hemisphere. It seems possible that inter-solar cycle and geographic variability, if not geographic differences, may account for discrepancies. Herein, we examine the start of a planetary study on any influence of geomagnetic disturbances that are most pronounced in the auroral oval, on human HRV. The magnetic field variations exhibit complex spectra and include the frequency band between 0.001-10 Hz, which is regarded as ultra-low frequency by physicists. Since the 'ultra-low-frequency' range, like other endpoints used in cardiology, refers to much higher frequencies than the about-yearly changes that are here shown to play a role in environmental-organismic interactions revealed by HRV, the current designations used in cardiology are all placed in quotation marks to indicate the need for possible revision. Whether or not this suggestion has an immediate response, we have pointed to a need for the development of instrumentation and software that renders the assessment of circadian, infradian and even infra-annual (truly low frequency) modulations routinely feasible. HRV was examined on the basis of nearly continuous 7-day records by ECG between December 10, 1998, and November 2, 2000, on 19 clinically healthy subjects, 21 to 54 years of age, in Alta, Norway. A geomagnetic record was obtained from the Auroral Observatory of the University of Tromsø. First, frequency-domain measures of HRV were compared for each person in 24-hour spans of high geomagnetic disturbance versus quiet conditions. Second, cross-spectra between geomagnetic activity and HRV measures were quantified via the squared coherence spectrum using 7-day time series. A 7.5% increase in the 24-hour average of heart rate, HR (P = 0.00020) and a decrease in HRV were documented on days of high geomagnetic disturbance. The decrease in HRV was validated statistically for the 'total frequency', 'TF' endpoint (18.6% decrease, P= 0.00009). The decrease in spectral power was found primarily in the 'circaminutan frequency', 'VLF' (21.9% decrease, P< 0.000001) in conjunction with the 'minutes-to-hours' component, ultra-low-frequency, 'ULF' (15.5% decrease, P= 0.00865) and circadecasecundan 'low frequency', 'LF' (14.2% decrease, P = 0.00187) regions of the spectrum. Power-law scaling of the power spectra did not show any statistically significant difference. It is noteworthy that most of the decrease in HRV, except for the circaminutan (VLF) component, was observed only in the season in which sunshine alternated with darkness (D/L), a finding suggesting a mechanism influenced by the alternation of light and darkness. The hypothesis of a light-dark-influenced magnetoreception was also supported by cross-spectral analysis. Group-averaged coherence at frequencies coincident with the geomagnetic Pc 6 pulsations (with periods ranging from 10 minutes to 5 hours) differed with a statistical significance (P < 0.000001) among the three natural lighting conditions, the association being weaker during UL or D/D than during D/L. By contrast, no statistically significant differences were found in terms of the circadian and circasemidian frequencies in relation to the alternation of sunshine with darkness or rather circannual rhythm stage. In conclusion, evidence is provided herein that an alteration of HRV is most apparent in the circaminutan ('VLF') region, which is clinically important, because a reduction in its power is a predictor of morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular disease. The circadecasecundan ('LF') component of HRV also decreased in association with geomagnetic disturbance, which may reflect an episodic alteration of arterial pressure related to changes in geomagnetic activity. Lastly, our study suggests the existence of a light-dark-influenced magnetoreception mechanism in humans involving mainly the Pc 6 band of the magnetic field.

N2  - Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common arrhythmia disease. Detection of atrial  fibrillation based on electrocardiogram (ECG) is of great significance for clinical diagnosis. Due to the non-linearity and complexity of ECG signals, the procedure to manually diagnose the ECG signals takes a lot of time and is prone to errors. In order to overcome the above problems, a feature extraction method based on RR interval is proposed in this paper. The discrete degree of RR interval is described with the robust coefficient of variation (RCV), the distribution shape of RR interval is described with the skewness parameter (SKP), and the complexity of RR interval is described with the Lempel-Ziv complexity (LZC). Finally, the feature vectors of RCV, SKP, and LZC are input into the support vector machine (SVM) classifier model to achieve automatic classification and detection of atrial fibrillation. To verify the validity and practicability of the proposed method, the MIT-BIH atrial fibrillation database was used to verify the data. The final classification results show that the sensitivity is 95.81%, the specificity is 96.48%, the accuracy is 96.09%, and the specificity of 95.16% is achieved in the MIT-BIH normal sinus rhythm database. The experimental results show that the proposed method is an effective classification method for atrial fibrillation.

N2  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac  arrhythmia in clinical practice, having been recognized as a true cardiovascular epidemic. In this paper, a new methodology for Computer Aided Diagnosis of AF based on a special kind of artificial adaptive systems has been developed. METHODS: Following the extraction of data from the PhysioNet repository, a new dataset composed of the R/R distances of 73 patients was created. To avoid redundancy, the training set was created by randomly selecting 50% of the subjects from the entire sample, thus making a choice by patient and not by record. The remaining 50% of subjects were randomly split by records in testing and prediction sets. The original ECG data has been transformed according to the following four orders of abstraction: a) sequence of R/R intervals; b) composition of ECG data into a moving window; c) training of different machine learning systems to abstract the function governing the AF; d) fuzzy transformation of Machine learning estimations. In this paper, in parallel with the classic method of windowing, we propose a variant based on a system of progressive moving averages. RESULTS: The best performing machine learning, Supervised Contractive Map (SVCm), reached an overall mean accuracy of 95%. SVCm is a new deep neural network based on a different principle than the usual descending gradient. The minimization of the error occurs by means of decomposition into contracted sine functions. CONCLUSIONS: In this research, atrial fibrillation is considered from a completely different point of view than classical methods. It is seen as the stable process, i.e. the function, that manages the irregularity of the irregularities of the R/R intervals. The idea, therefore, is to abstract from mere physiology to investigate fibrillation as a mathematical object that handles irregularities. The attained results seem to open new perspectives for the use of potent artificial adaptive systems for the automatic detection of atrial fibrillation, with accuracy rates extremely promising for real world applications.

N2  - Several investigators have shown signs of possible sympathetic but not  parasympathetic reinnervation in heart transplanted patients. Spectral analysis of heart rate and blood pressure variability is a noninvasive tool appropriate to detect a functional autonomous reinnervation to the heart. In a follow-up study, 13 patients after heart transplantation (HTx) were investigated, mean age 50.6+/-8.5 years, 18 healthy volunteers were selected as control group. For each patient two recordings were performed which took part 14+/-5 months respectively 42+/-8 months after HTx. ECG and systolic blood pressure (SBP) have been recorded simultaneously for 5 min in supine position during controlled respiratory rate of 12 or 15 cycles/min. No graft rejection has been detected in the endomyocardial biopsy performed right after the recordings. Power spectral densities (PSD) were calculated for the beat-to-beat time series of RR-intervals (distance of two following QRS complexes) and SBPs. The area of PSD in the range of 0.05-0.17 Hz was defined as low frequency (LF) and that of 0.18-0.35 Hz as high frequency (HF). LF and HF are indicative of efferent sympathetic respectively parasympathetic activity at the sinus node. A significant increase of LF (226%) and HF (213%) during a mean period of 28 months could be found. No differences were to be shown for systolic blood pressure variability. Previous findings confirm that LF band increases 4 years after transplantation, suggesting a possible sympathetic reinnervation of the heart. On the other hand an increase of the HF band also suggests a parasympathetic reinnervation.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate the association of 4 left bundle branch  block (LBBB) definitions and their individual ECG characteristics with clinical outcome. Furthermore, it aimed to combine relevant outcome-associated electrocardiographic (ECG) characteristics into a novel outcome-based definition. BACKGROUND: LBBB morphology is associated with positive response to cardiac resynchronization therapy. However, there are multiple LBBB definitions. Associations with outcomes may differ between definitions and depend on varying contributions of the individual ECG characteristics that these LBBB definitions are composed of. METHODS: A retrospective multicenter study was conducted in 1,492 cardiac resynchronization therapy patients. Patients were classified as LBBB or non-LBBB according to definitions provided by the European Society of Cardiology, American Heart Association, MADIT-CRT (Multicenter Automatic Defibrillator Implantation with Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy) trial, and according to Strauss et al., the primary endpoint was left ventricular assist device implantation, cardiac transplantation, and all-cause mortality. RESULTS: LBBB classification differed significantly between the 4 definitions (kappa coefficients ranging from 0.09 to 0.92). The American Heart Association definition correlated the least (0.09 to 0.12) with the other definitions. Only 13.8% of patients were classified as LBBB by all definitions. During a follow-up period of 3.4 ± 2.4 years, 472 (32%) patients experienced the primary endpoint. For each LBBB definition survival analysis showed a significant association of LBBB with outcome, with relative risk reduction ranging from 39% to 43%. Each LBBB definition included characteristics that were not associated with outcome. Combining outcome-associated ECG characteristics into a novel prediction model did not significantly improve diagnostic performance (relative risk reduction 43%). CONCLUSIONS: The classification of LBBB is highly dependent on the LBBB definition used. However, each LBBB definition provides a comparable difference in risk of adverse clinical events between LBBB and non-LBBB patients. Combining individual outcome-associated ECG-characteristics into a novel prediction model does not improve association with outcome.

N2  - Recent advances in sensor and recording technology have allowed scientists to  acquire very large time-series datasets. Researchers often analyze these datasets in the context of events, which are intervals of time where the properties of the signal change relative to a baseline signal. We have developed DETECT, a MATLAB toolbox for detecting event time intervals in long, multi-channel time series. Our primary goal is to produce a toolbox that is simple for researchers to use, allowing them to quickly train a model on multiple classes of events, assess the accuracy of the model, and determine how closely the results agree with their own manual identification of events without requiring extensive programming knowledge or machine learning experience. As an illustration, we discuss application of the DETECT toolbox for detecting signal artifacts found in continuous multi-channel EEG recordings and show the functionality of the tools found in the toolbox. We also discuss the application of DETECT for identifying irregular heartbeat waveforms found in electrocardiogram (ECG) data as an additional illustration.

N2  - Fitness level, fatigue and adaptation are important factors for determining the  optimal training schedule and predicting future performance. We think that adding analysis of the mutual relationships between cardiac and respiratory activity enables better athlete profiling and feedback for improving training. Therefore, the main objectives were (1) to apply several methods for temporal causality analysis to cardiorespiratory data; (2) to establish causal links between the signals; and (3) to determine how parameterized connections differed across various subgroups. One hundred elite athletes (31 female) and a control group of 20 healthy students (6 female) took part in the study. All were asked to follow a protocol comprising two 5-min sessions of free breathing - once supine, once standing. The data were collected using Pneumonitor 2. Respiratory-related curves were obtained through impedance pneumography, along with a single-lead ECG. Several signals (e.g., tidal volume, instantaneous respiratory rate, and instantaneous heart rate) were derived and stored as: (1) raw data down-sampled to 25Hz; (2) further down-sampled to 2.5Hz; and (3) beat-by-beat sequences. Granger causality frameworks (pairwise-conditional, spectral or extended), along with Time Series Models with Independent Noise (TiMINo), were studied. The connections enabling the best distinctions were found using recursive feature elimination with a random forest kernel. Temporal causal links are the most evident between tidal volume and instantaneous heart rate signals. Predictions of the "effect" variable were improved by adding preceding "cause" samples, by medians of 20.3% for supine and 14.2% for standing body positions. Parameterized causal link structures and directions distinguish athletes from non-athletes with 83.3% accuracy on average. They may also be used to supplement standard analysis and enable classification into groups exhibiting different static and dynamic components during performance. Physiological markers of training may be extended to include cardiorespiratory data, and causality analysis may improve the resolution of training profiling and the precision of outcome prediction.

N2  - BACKGROUND: To evaluate QT-interval dynamics in patients and in drug safety  analysis, beat-to-beat QT-interval measurements are increasingly used. However, interobserver differences, aberrant T-wave morphologies and changes in heart axis might hamper accurate QT-interval measurements. OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate a QT-interval algorithm robust to heart axis orientation and T-wave morphology that can be applied on a beat-to-beat basis. METHODS: Additionally to standard ECG leads, the root mean square (ECGRMS), standard deviation and vectorcardiogram were used. QRS-onset was defined from the ECGRMS. T-wave end was defined per individual lead and scalar ECG using an automated tangent method. A median of all T-wave ends was used as the general T-wave end per beat. Supine-standing tests of 73 patients with Long-QT syndrome (LQTS) and 54 controls were used because they have wide ranges of RR and QT-intervals as well as changes in T-wave morphology and heart axis orientation. For each subject, automatically estimated QT-intervals in three random complexes chosen from the low, middle and high RR range, were compared with manually measured QT-intervals by three observers. RESULTS: After visual inspection of the randomly selected complexes, 21 complexes were excluded because of evident noise, too flat T-waves or premature ventricular beats. Bland-Altman analyses of automatically and manually determined QT-intervals showed a bias of <4ms and limits of agreement of ±25ms. Intra-class coefficient indicated excellent agreement (>0.9) between the algorithm and all observers individually as well as between the algorithm and the mean QT-interval of the observers. CONCLUSION: Our automated algorithm provides reliable beat-to-beat QT-interval assessment, robust to heart axis and T-wave morphology.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Cemented total hip arthroplasty (THA) is a safe and common procedure. In  rare cases life threatening bone cement implantation syndrome (BCIS) may occur, which is commonly caused by pulmonary embolism (PE). CASE PRESENTATION: We describe the rare case of a 70-year old patient who underwent an elective total hip replacement. Before surgery he was diagnosed with underlying systemic indolent mastocytosis, a rare pathological disorder that may result in anaphylaxis after massive systemic mast cell activation. Triggers may be IgE-mediated, direct mast cell activation, or unclear. Some patients may be at risk for severe non IgE-mediated reactions, such as those experienced with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or with perioperative muscle relaxants. During cementing of the acetabular component, our patient developed acute hypotension (blood pressure dropped from 90/50 to 60/40 mmHg, and saturation dropped from 95 to 80 %). The differential diagnosis of acute PE was excluded (no signs of breathing abnormalities during physical examination, normal arterial blood sample, and no electrocardiography or cardiac ultrasound abnormalities). The patient was diagnosed with acute anaphylactic shock, which was successfully managed by 100 % oxygen administration, rapid fluid induction, and vasoconstrictive drug therapy. He recovered hemodynamically within 15 min, did not lose consciousness, and did not develop angioedema or an urticarial rash. Forty-five minutes after onset of the symptoms, the surgical procedure was completed after inserting a press fitted uncemented femoral stem component. The patient was transported to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for optimal monitoring. Our patient had an uneventful recovery. Within six hours after surgery he started to ambulate following our standard fast-track rehabilitation regime. Post-operative day one he was discharged to the specialized Orthopedic Department, and after five hospital days discharged to his home. Twelve months after THA surgery our patient was satisfied with an optimal functional status of his hip joint replacement. CONCLUSION: The differential diagnosis of anaphylactic shock must be taken into consideration in patients with acute hypotension during cementing of total hip arthroplasty components. Patients with underlying mastocytosis are at particular risk of this potential life-threatening intra-operative complication. This rare entity should be taken into consideration during the pre-operative risk stratification and shared decision-making process for elective cemented joint replacement.

N2  - J wave is the bulge generated in the descending slope of the terminal portion of the  QRS complex in the electrocardiogram. The presence of J wave may lead to sudden death. However, the diagnosis of J wave variation only depends on doctor's clinical experiences at present and missed diagnosis is easy to occur. In this paper, a new method is proposed to realize the automatic detection of J wave. First, the synchrosqueezed wavelet transform is used to obtain the precise time-frequency information of the ECG. Then, the inverse transformation of SST is computed to get the intrinsic mode function of the ECG. At last, the time-frequency features and SST-based and the entropy features based on modes are fed to Random forest to realize the automatic detection of J wave. As the experimental results shown, the proposed method has achieved the highest accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity compared with existing techniques.

N2  - This paper presents a new method to analyse cardiac electrophysiological dynamics.  It aims to classify or to cluster (i.e. to find natural groups) patients according to the dynamics of features extracted from their ECG. In this work, the dynamics of the features are modelled with Continuous Density Hidden Semi-Markovian Models (CDHSMM) which are interesting for the characterization of continuous multivariate time series without a priori information. These models can be easily used for classification and clustering. In this last case, a specific method, based on a fuzzy Expectation Maximisation (EM) algorithm, is proposed. Both tasks are applied to the analysis of ischemic episodes with encouraging results and a classification accuracy of 71%.

N2  - Cardiac monitoring is routinely performed on all adult patients in the immediate  postoperative period in the Phase I PACU, regardless of the surgery/procedure or type of anesthesia given. This practice is based on the premise that there may be a possibility of a postanesthesia arrhythmia or cardiac event that would need to be recognized and treated. The purpose of this study was to explore whether routine cardiac monitoring is a valid practice for healthy individuals (ASA I) or merely a tradition of postanesthesia nursing care.

N2  - Introduction: Partial and advanced interatrial block (IAB) in the  electrocardiographic (ECG) represents inter-atrial conduction delay. IAB is associated with atrial fibrillation (AF) and stroke in the general population.Material and methods: A representative sample of Finnish subjects (n = 6354) aged over 30 years (mean: 52.2 years, standard deviation: 14.6) underwent a health examination including a 12-lead ECG. Five different IAB groups based on automatic measurements were compared to normal P waves using multivariate-adjusted Cox proportional hazard model. Follow-up lasted up to 15 years.Results: The prevalence of advanced and partial IAB was 1.0% and 9.7%, respectively. In the multivariate model, both advanced (hazard ratio (HR): 1.63 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.00-2.65)) and partial IAB (HR: 1.39 (1.09-1.77)) were associated with increased risk of AF. Advanced IAB was associated with increased risk of stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA) independently of associated AF (HR: 2.22 (1.20-4.13)). Partial IAB was also associated with increased risk of being diagnosed with coronary heart disease (HR: 1.26 (1.01-1.58)).Discussion: IAB is a rather frequent finding in the general population. IAB is a risk factor for AF and is associated with an increased risk of stroke or TIA independently of associated AF.Key messagesBoth partial and advanced interatrial block are associated with increased risk of atrial fibrillation in the general population.Advanced interatrial block is an independent risk factor for stroke and transient ischaemic attack.The clinical significance of interatrial block is dependent on the subtype classification.

He received bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation and one shock from an automatic external defibrillator, successfully restoring sinus rhythm. On arrival, he was haemodynamically stable without ECG evidence of ST segment changes to suggest active ischaemia, and an initial troponin I was mildly elevated at 0.10 ng/mL (normal <0.04 ng/mL). A CT angiogram (CTA) was obtained showing a normal-appearing aorta and no abnormal extracardiac findings. Urgent coronary angiography was performed; images are shown in figure 1A-C. Echocardiogram revealed a mildly reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (45%) with a hypokinetic inferior wall.heartjnl;104/21/1771/F1F1F1Figure 1(A) Right coronary artery angiogram in the left anterior oblique cranial projection.

N2  - Yogic high-frequency respiration--kapalabhati (KB)--was studied in 24 subjects from  a point of rhythmicity. Respiratory movements, blood pressure and R-R intervals of ECG were recorded in parallel and evaluated by spectral analysis of time series. Respiratory signals during KB were modulated by 0.1 Hz rhythm in 82% of experiments. This component was also present in R-R intervals and blood pressure during KB. Frequency (0.2-0.3 Hz) was observed in 67% of respiratory records. The presence of the component 0.2-0.3 Hz in respiration was dependent on resting respiratory frequency. This frequency component was reduced in R-R intervals but increased in blood pressure during kapalabhati as compared to that at rest. The occurrence of both frequency components in respiration during KB supports the hypothesis about the integrative role of cardiovascular and respiratory rhythms in physiological states characterized by altered respiratory frequency.

N2  - Electroencephalogram (EEG)-based prediction systems are used to target  anesthetic-states in patients undergoing procedures with general anesthesia (GA). These systems are not widely employed in resource-limited settings because they are cost-prohibitive. Although anesthetic-drugs induce highly-structured, oscillatory neural dynamics that make EEG-based systems a principled approach for anesthetic-state monitoring, anesthetic-drugs also significantly modulate the autonomic nervous system (ANS). Because ANS dynamics can be inferred from electrocardiogram (ECG) features such as heart rate variability, it may be possible to develop an ECG-based system to infer anesthetic-states as a low-cost and practical alternative to EEG-based anesthetic-state prediction systems. In this work, we demonstrate that an ECG-based system using ANS features can be used to discriminate between non-GA and GA states in sevoflurane, with a GA F(1) score of 0.834, [95% CI, 0.776, 0.892], and in sevoflurane-plus-ketamine, with a GA F(1) score of 0.880 [0.815, 0.954]. With further refinement, ECG-based anesthetic-state systems could be developed as a fully automated system for anesthetic-state monitoring in resource-limited settings.

N2  - Feature test-retest reliability is proposed as a useful criterion for the  selection/exclusion of features in time series classification tasks. Three sets of physiological time series are examined, EEG and ECG recordings together with measurements of neck movement. Comparisons of reliability estimates from test-retest studies with measures of feature importance from classification tasks suggest that low reliability can be used to exclude irrelevant features prior to classifier training. By removing features with low reliability an unnecessary degradation of the classifier accuracy may be avoided.

N2  - Detection of arrhythmic atrial beats in surface ECGs can be challenging when they  are masked by the R or T wave, or do not affect the RR-interval. Here, we present a solution using a high-resolution esophageal long-term ECG that offers a detailed view on the atrial electrical activity. The recorded ECG shows atrial ectopic beats with long coupling intervals, which can only be successfully classified using additional morphology criteria. Esophageal high-resolution ECGs provide this information, whereas surface long-term ECGs show poor atrial signal quality. This new method is a promising tool for the long-term rhythm monitoring with software-based automatic classification of atrial beats.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Corrected QT interval (QTc) on electrocardiography (ECG) at rest and  after exercise in a short daytime recording period may be insufficient for the diagnosis and management of long QT syndrome (LQTS), especially for LQTS type 2 and 3. Therefore, examination of QTc on Holter ECG is important. We designed a method of analyzing QTc on Holter ECG that can be performed in daily clinical practice by combining automatic and manual measurements. METHODS: We reviewed the charts of healthy children (n = 210) and LQTS patients (n = 35) aged <16 years and analyzed QTc at rest and after exercise, and the maximum QTc on Holter ECG. RESULTS: The QTc (Fridericia's correction) of most controls and LQTS patients reached the maximum at night or early in the morning. QTc differed according to sex and age. In the control group, QTc on ECG of all three types tended to lengthen with age. QTc after exercise was slightly longer than QTc at rest, and the maximum QTc on Holter ECG was much longer than both, reaching >450 ms in boys and 500 ms in girls. In most LQTS type 1 patients, QTc after exercise and that on Holter ECG tended to be long. In most LQTS type 2 and 3 patients, QTc at rest and that after exercise was long, and that on Holter ECG tended to be much longer. CONCLUSIONS: The present method of analyzing QTc on Holter ECG, in which automatic and manual measurements are combined, is practical and may be useful for diagnosis and risk stratification of LQTS.

N2  - This review examines the influence on heart rate variability (HRV) indices in  athletes from training status, different types of exercise training, sex and ageing, presented from both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. The predictability of HRV in over-training, athletic condition and athletic performance is also included. Finally, some recommendations concerning the application of HRV methods in athletes are made.The cardiovascular system is mostly controlled by autonomic regulation through the activity of sympathetic and parasympathetic pathways of the autonomic nervous system. Analysis of HRV permits insight in this control mechanism. It can easily be determined from ECG recordings, resulting in time series (RR-intervals) that are usually analysed in time and frequency domains. As a first approach, it can be assumed that power in different frequency bands corresponds to activity of sympathetic (0.04-0.15 Hz) and parasympathetic (0.15-0.4 Hz) nerves. However, other mechanisms (and feedback loops) are also at work, especially in the low frequency band. During dynamic exercise, it is generally assumed that heart rate increases due to both a parasympathetic withdrawal and an augmented sympathetic activity. However, because some authors disagree with the former statement and the fact that during exercise there is also a technical problem related to the non-stationary signals, a critical look at interpretation of results is needed. It is strongly suggested that, when presenting reports on HRV studies related to exercise physiology in general or concerned with athletes, a detailed description should be provided on analysis methods, as well as concerning population, and training schedule, intensity and duration. Most studies concern relatively small numbers of study participants, diminishing the power of statistics. Therefore, multicentre studies would be preferable. In order to further develop this fascinating research field, we advocate prospective, randomised, controlled, long-term studies using validated measurement methods. Finally, there is a strong need for basic research on the nature of the control and regulating mechanism exerted by the autonomic nervous system on cardiovascular function in athletes, preferably with a multidisciplinary approach between cardiologists, exercise physiologists, pulmonary physiologists, coaches and biomedical engineers.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: Patients in ICUs are susceptible to subacute potentially catastrophic  illnesses such as respiratory failure, sepsis, and hemorrhage that present as severe derangements of vital signs. More subtle physiologic signatures may be present before clinical deterioration, when treatment might be more effective. We performed multivariate statistical analyses of bedside physiologic monitoring data to identify such early subclinical signatures of incipient life-threatening illness. DESIGN: We report a study of model development and validation of a retrospective observational cohort using resampling (Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model for Individual Prognosis Or Diagnosis type 1b internal validation) and a study of model validation using separate data (type 2b internal/external validation). SETTING: University of Virginia Health System (Charlottesville), a tertiary-care, academic medical center. PATIENTS: Critically ill patients consecutively admitted between January 2009 and June 2015 to either the neonatal, surgical/trauma/burn, or medical ICUs with available physiologic monitoring data. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We analyzed 146 patient-years of vital sign and electrocardiography waveform time series from the bedside monitors of 9,232 ICU admissions. Calculations from 30-minute windows of the physiologic monitoring data were made every 15 minutes. Clinicians identified 1,206 episodes of respiratory failure leading to urgent unplanned intubation, sepsis, or hemorrhage leading to multi-unit transfusions from systematic individual chart reviews. Multivariate models to predict events up to 24 hours prior had internally validated C-statistics of 0.61-0.88. In adults, physiologic signatures of respiratory failure and hemorrhage were distinct from each other but externally consistent across ICUs. Sepsis, on the other hand, demonstrated less distinct and inconsistent signatures. Physiologic signatures of all neonatal illnesses were similar. CONCLUSIONS: Subacute potentially catastrophic illnesses in three diverse ICU populations have physiologic signatures that are detectable in the hours preceding clinical detection and intervention. Detection of such signatures can draw attention to patients at highest risk, potentially enabling earlier intervention and better outcomes.

N2  - Automatic methods for the detection of characteristic points in electrocardiography  signals support cardiologists in assessing the state of a patient's cardiovascular system. In this work, we apply a general method for parameter estimation to the specific problem of QRS complex, P-, and T-wave delineation, i.e. the computation of their on- and offset points in time. As input the method expects a piecewise Gaussian derivative model that is potentially a good fit for the morphology of electrocardiography waves, but a thorough investigation is needed. The model parameters are estimated by substituting zero-crossings of the input signals' scale-space representation into scale-dependent algebraic expressions and are further refined by fitting the model to the electrocardiography signal in a least-squares sense. Validating the results on the QT database and comparing to state-of-the-art algorithms shows smallest mean error for 3 out of 9 fiducial points and for the others only small differences to the respective best competitors.

N2  - The autonomic nervous system (ANS) controls mainly automatic bodily functions that  are engaged in homeostasis, like heart rate, digestion, respiratory rate, salivation, perspiration and renal function. The ANS has two main branches: the sympathetic nervous system, preparing the human body for action in times of danger and stress, and the parasympathetic nervous system, which regulates the resting state of the body. ANS activity can be measured invasively, for instance by radiotracer techniques or microelectrode recording from superficial nerves, or it can be measured non-invasively by using changes in an organ's response as a proxy for changes in ANS activity, for instance of the sweat glands or the heart. Invasive measurements have the highest validity but are very poorly feasible in large scale samples where non-invasive measures are the preferred approach. Autonomic effects on the heart can be reliably quantified by the recording of the electrocardiogram (ECG) in combination with the impedance cardiogram (ICG), which reflects the changes in thorax impedance in response to respiration and the ejection of blood from the ventricle into the aorta. From the respiration and ECG signals, respiratory sinus arrhythmia can be extracted as a measure of cardiac parasympathetic control. From the ECG and the left ventricular ejection signals, the preejection period can be extracted as a measure of cardiac sympathetic control. ECG and ICG recording is mostly done in laboratory settings. However, having the subjects report to a laboratory greatly reduces ecological validity, is not always doable in large scale epidemiological studies, and can be intimidating for young children. An ambulatory device for ECG and ICG simultaneously resolves these three problems. Here, we present a study design for a minimally invasive and rapid assessment of cardiac autonomic control in children, using a validated ambulatory device (1-5), the VU University Ambulatory Monitoring System (VU-AMS, Amsterdam, the Netherlands, www.vu-ams.nl).

N2  - The electrocardiogram (ECG) signal is widely employed as one of the most important  tools in clinical practice in order to assess the cardiac status of patients. The classification of the ECG into different pathologic disease categories is a complex pattern recognition task. In this paper, we propose a method for ECG heartbeat pattern recognition using wavelet neural network (WNN). To achieve this objective, an algorithm for QRS detection is first implemented, then a WNN Classifier is developed. The experimental results obtained by testing the proposed approach on ECG data from the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database demonstrate the efficiency of such an approach when compared with other methods existing in the literature.

N2  - Sleep-related conditions require high-cost and low-comfort diagnosis at the hospital  during one night or longer. To overcome this situation, this work aims to evaluate an unobtrusive monitoring technique for sleep apnea. This paper presents, for the first time, the evaluation of contactless capacitively-coupled electrocardiography (ccECG) signals for the extraction of sleep apnea features, together with a comparison of different signal quality indicators. A multichannel ccECG system is used to collect signals from 15 subjects in a sleep environment from different positions. Reference quality labels were assigned for every 30-s segment. Quality indicators were calculated, and their signal classification performance was evaluated. Features for the detection of sleep apnea were extracted from capacitive and reference signals. Sleep apnea features related to heart rate and heart rate variability achieved high similarity to the reference values, with p-values of 0.94 and 0.98, which is in line with the more than 95% beat-matching obtained. Features related to signal morphology presented lower similarity with the reference, although signal similarity metrics of correlation and coherence were relatively high. Quality-based automatic classification of the signals had a maximum accuracy of 91%. Best-performing quality indicators were based on template correlation and beat-detection. Results suggest that using unobtrusive cardiac signals for the automatic detection of sleep apnea can achieve similar performance as contact signals, and indicates clinical value of ccECG. Moreover, signal segments can automatically be classified by the proposed quality metrics as a pre-processing step. Including contactless respiration signals is likely to improve the performance and provide a complete unobtrusive cardiorespiratory monitoring solution; this is a promising alternative that will allow the screening of more patients with higher comfort, for a longer time, and at a reduced cost.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Wired electrocardiogram monitors are an important component of current  perioperative monitoring. Wireless monitoring units could help reduce the number of cables attached to patients and thus improve anesthesia ergonomics and patient management. However, there is concern that electromagnetic interference generated by electrosurgical units may prevent effective wireless signals in the operating room. To evaluate the extent of this problem, we developed a Bluetooth electrocardiogram prototype monitor and compared its electrocardiogram traces to those captured with a standard wired electrocardiogram monitor in our operating room. METHODS: Bluetooth electrocardiogram and standard electrocardiogram traces captured from 10 patients undergoing surgical procedures that required use of an electrosurgical unit were compared by analysis of the durations of the P wave, QRS complex, and T wave and the position of the ST segment from the isoelectric line. The impact of the electrosurgical units on the Bluetooth electrocardiogram and S-electrocardiogram recordings was also assessed. RESULTS: There were no clinically relevant differences in P wave, QRS complex, or T-wave durations (0.006, 0.004, and 0.017 seconds, respectively) between Bluetooth electrocardiogram and standard electrocardiogram or in the position of the ST segment from the isoelectric line (0.02 mV). Mean differences were near zero, and Bland-Altman limits of agreement for individual differences were narrow (-0.035 to 0.047, -0.03 to 0.038, and -0.112 to 0.078 seconds for P wave, QRS complex, and T-wave durations, respectively, and -0.13 to 0.17 mV for ST segment position). Electrosurgical units use electrically disrupted Bluetooth electrocardiogram and standard electrocardiogram signals, but there was no electromagnetic interference effect on the Bluetooth electrocardiogram signals. CONCLUSIONS: Wireless electrocardiogram using Bluetooth can be reliably used in the operating room. The electrosurgical unit induces electric rather than electromagnetic artifacts, thus affecting wired and wireless electrocardiogram in a similar fashion.

N2  - Reconstruction of phase space is an effective method to quantify the dynamics of a  signal or a time series. Various phase space reconstruction techniques have been investigated. However, there are some issues on the optimal reconstructions and the best possible choice of the reconstruction parameters. This research introduces the idea of gradient cross recurrence (GCR) and mean gradient cross recurrence density which shows that reconstructions in time frequency domain preserve more information about the dynamics than the optimal reconstructions in time domain. This analysis is further extended to ECG signals of normal and congestive heart failure patients. By using another newly introduced measure-gradient cross recurrence period density entropy, two classes of aforesaid ECG signals can be classified with a proper threshold. This analysis can be applied to quantifying and distinguishing biomedical and other nonlinear signals.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Compressed sensing is a low-complexity compression technology that has  recently been proposed. It can be applied to long-term electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring using wearable devices. In this study, an automatic screening method for atrial fibrillation based on lossy compression of the electrocardiogram signal is proposed. APPROACH: The proposed method combines the compressed sensing with the convolutional neural network. The sparse binary sensing matrix is first used to project the raw ECG signal randomly, transformed the raw ECG data from high-dimensional space to low-dimensional space to complete compression, and then uses CNN to classify the compressed ECG signal involving AF. Our proposed model is validated on the MIT-BIH Atrial Fibrillation Database. MAIN RESULTS: The experimental results show that the model only needs about 1s to complete the 24-hour ECG recording of AF, which is 3.41%, 69.84% and 67.56% less than the time required by AlexNet, VGGNet and GoogLeNet. Under different compression ratios of 10% to 90%, the maximum and minimum F1 scores reach 96.25% and 88.17%, respectively. SIGNIFICANCE: The CS-CNN model has high computational efficiency while ensuring prediction accuracy, and is a promising method for AF screening in wearable application scenarios.

N2  - Processing temporal sequences is central to a variety of applications in health  care, and in particular multichannel Electrocardiogram (ECG) is a highly prevalent diagnostic modality that relies on robust sequence modeling. While Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have led to significant advances in automated diagnosis with time-series data, they perform poorly when models are trained using a limited set of channels. A crucial limitation of existing solutions is that they rely solely on discriminative models, which tend to generalize poorly in such scenarios. In order to combat this limitation, we develop a generative modeling approach to limited channel ECG classification. This approach first uses a Seq2Seq model to implicitly generate the missing channel information, and then uses the latent representation to perform the actual supervisory task. This decoupling enables the use of unsupervised data and also provides highly robust metric spaces for subsequent discriminative learning. Our experiments with the Physionet dataset clearly evidence the effectiveness of our approach over standard RNNs in disease prediction.

N2  - The purpose of the study was to compare the EASI system with the standard 12-lead  surface electrocardiogram (ECG) for the accuracy in detecting the main electrocardiographic parameters (J point, PR, QT, and QRS) commonly monitored in patients with acute coronary syndromes or heart failure. In this observational comparative study, 253 patients who were consecutively admitted to the coronary care unit with acute coronary syndrome or heart failure were evaluated. In all patients, two complete 12-lead ECGs were acquired simultaneously. A total of 6,072 electrocardiographic leads were compared (3,036 standard and 3,036 EASI). No significant differences were found between the investigate parameters of the two measurement methods, either in patients with acute coronary syndrome or in those with heart failure. This study confirmed the accuracy of the EASI system in monitoring the main ECG parameters in patients admitted to the coronary care unit with acute coronary syndrome or heart failure.

N2  - Automatic detection of fetal ECG features can assist in diagnosis of fetal cardiac  complications and may reduce the time required for diagnosis. Detection of the end of the repolarization period wave in ECG has been proven challenging due to its low amplitude and low frequency range. The prolongation of end of T-wave is associated with sudden cardiac death, thus, methods that can accurately pinpoint it is highly desirable for early diagnosis of cardiac diseases. In this paper, a technique based on recurrence plots is developed for the detection of end of T-wave. The developed technique was tested on maternal ECG (mECG), fetal scalp ECG (fsECG) and non-invasive fetal ECG (nfECG) records. The technique was able to detect end of T-waves in all of the mECG beats, 75% of the non-invasive fECG beats (verified by simultaneously captured doppler ultrasound signals) and 78% of the fsECG beats. Detection of fECG signals were more challenging than mECG signals due to the noise and their low amplitude T-waves.

N2  - The development of a system for the automatic, objective, and reliable detection of  cough events is a need underlined by the medical literature for years. The benefit of such a tool is clear as it would allow the assessment of pathology severity in chronic cough diseases. Even though some approaches have recently reported solutions achieving this task with a relative success, there is still no standardization about the method to adopt or the sensors to use. The goal of this paper is to study objectively the performance of several sensors for cough detection: ECG, thermistor, chest belt, accelerometer, contact, and audio microphones. Experiments are carried out on a database of 32 healthy subjects producing, in a confined room and in three situations, voluntary cough at various volumes as well as other event categories which can possibly lead to some detection errors: background noise, forced expiration, throat clearing, speech, and laugh. The relevance of each sensor is evaluated at three stages: mutual information conveyed by the features, ability to discriminate at the frame level cough from these latter other sources of ambiguity, and ability to detect cough events. In this latter experiment, with both an averaged sensitivity and specificity of about 94.5%, the proposed approach is shown to clearly outperform the commercial Karmelsonix system which achieved a specificity of 95.3% and a sensitivity of 64.9%.

N2  - The automatic analysis of the electrocardiogram (ECG) begins, traditionally, with  the detection of QRS complexes. Afterwards, useful information can be extracted from it, ranging from the estimation of the instantaneous heart rate to nonlinear heart rate variability analysis. A plethora of works have been published on this topic; consequently, there exist many QRS complex detectors with high-performance values. However, just a few detectors have been conceived that profit from the information contained in several ECG leads to provide a robust QRS complex detection. In this work, we explore the fusion of multi-channel ECG recordings QRS detections as a means to improve the detection performance. This paper presents a decentralized multi-channel QRS complex fusion scheme that optimally combines single-channel detections to produce a single detection signal. Using six different widely used QRS complex detectors on the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia and INCART databases, a reduction in false and missed detections was achieved with the proposed approach compared with the single-channel counterpart. Furthermore, our detection results are comparable with the performance of other multi-channel detectors found in the literature, showing, in turn, various advantages in scalability, adaptability, and simplicity in the system's implementationGraphical AbstractN QRS complex detectors simultaneously monitor N ECG channels. Once a detection occurs in a given channel, a 150 ms long window is opened to look for detections in other channels. Within this window, y(n) = + 1 if a QRS complex is detected and y(n) = - 1 otherwise. A coefficient α n, obtained during a training period and related to the detection performance in channel n, multiplies the detection signal y(n), so that greater weights are assigned to ECG channels where single-channel detectors performed better. Finally, the binary detection decision (f ) is obtained from the comparison of the weighted sum of single-channel detections (z) with a fixed threshold (β).

N2  - This study aims to discover the characteristics of heart rate variability of resting  and real-time motional states in healthy population. The ECG data of 16 healthy young subjects during 5-minute resting and motion periods were recorded respectively. After that, the R wave was extracted through Hilbert transformation and the RR interval time series was computed. The calculations for HRV parameters in time and frequency domains, Poincaré scatter plots and the detrended fluctuation analysis were conducted. Our study finds that, the measures of real-time motion in time domain (Mean RR, SDNN and RMSSD), the measures in frequency domain (VLF, LF, HF, TP), and the measures of Poincaré scatter plots are significantly less than those of resting state (P <0.001). The measure of long-term fractal exponent (α(2)) in real-time motion state is significantly higher than resting state (P <0.05). Between the two states, there are no statistically significant differences in other parameters of frequency domain (LF norm, HF norm, LF/HF) and short-term fractal exponent (α(1)), P>0.05. This study suggests that, the results can provide new characteristic signatures and statistical evidence for sport medicine or rehabilitation medicine.

N2  - Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) polymorphism has been shown to be important in  hypertension progression and also in diabetes complications, especially associated with heart disease. Heart rate variability (HRV) is an established measure for classification of autonomic function regulating heart rate, based on the interbeat interval time series derived from a raw ECG recording. Results of this paper show that the length (number of interbeat intervals) and preprocessing of the tachogram affect the HRV analysis outcome. The comparison was based on tachogram lengths of 250, 300, 350, and 400 RR-intervals and five preprocessing approaches. An automated adaptive preprocessing method for the heart rate biosignal and tachogram length of 400 interbeat intervals provided the best classification. HRV results differed for the Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) group between the I/I genotype and the I/D and D/D genotypes, whereas for controls there was no significant difference in HRV between genotypes. Selecting an appropriate length of recording and automated preprocessing has confirmed that there is an effect of ACE polymorphism including the I/I genotype and that I/I should not be combined with I/D genotype in determining the extent of autonomic modulation of the heart rate.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: A neural network classifier has been designed, which is able to  distinguish atrial fibrillation (AF) from other supraventricular arrhythmias in ambulatory (Holter) ECGs. METHOD AND RESULTS: The classification algorithm uses a rhythm analysis that considers the ECG to be a time series of RR interval durations. This is combined with an analysis of baseline morphology that considers the morphological characteristics of the non-QRS portions of the waveform. A backpropagation-based neural network has been used as part of the classifier implementation. When applied to a library consisting exclusively of 42,970 examples of AF and other supraventricular rhythm disturbances validated by an experienced cardiologist, the algorithm demonstrated a sensitivity of 82.4% for 10-beat runs of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) and a specificity of 96.6%. Since this system has been implemented as a postprocessor to a conventional automated Holter system, operating only on segments of ECG that are known to contain supraventricular arrhythmias rather than ventricular arrhythmias or sinus rhythm, it can be added to most existing Holter processing systems without significantly increasing the average time to process a tape. CONCLUSION: A neural network system has been designed, which can potentially provide, for the first time, an accurate, quantitative technique to determine the natural history of PAF and to evaluate potential treatments for PAF.

N2  - Dexmedetomidine is a selective alpha-2 adrenergic agonist with concurrent sedative  and analgesic effects, and it is being increasingly used in pediatric anesthesia and intensive care. This study aimed to investigate the pharmacokinetics of intravenous dexmedetomidine in mechanically ventilated children in the intensive care unit (ICU) after neurosurgery. Pediatric patients aged 2-12 years, who were mechanically ventilated in ICU after neurosurgery, were allocated into a low-dose (n = 15) or high-dose (n = 14) group. The low-dose group received dexmedetomidine at a loading dose of 0.25 µg/kg for 10 min, followed by a maintenance dose of 0.25 µg/kg/h for 50 min, whereas the high-dose group received dexmedetomidine at a loading dose of 0.5 µg/kg for 10 min, followed by a maintenance dose of 0.5 µg/kg/h for 50 min. Serial blood samples were collected for a pharmacokinetic analysis up to 480 min after the end of the infusion. The sedative effect of dexmedetomidine was assessed using the Bispectral Index and University of Michigan Sedation Scale. Adverse reactions, electrocardiography findings, and vital signs were monitored for a safety assessment. A population pharmacokinetic analysis was performed using non-linear mixed effects modeling. Dexmedetomidine induced a moderate-to-deep degree of sedation during infusion in both groups. The pharmacokinetics of dexmedetomidine were best described by a two-compartment disposition model with first-order elimination kinetics. The parameters were standardized for a body weight of 70 kg using an allometric power model. The population estimates (95% confidence interval) per 70 kg body weight were as follows: clearance of 81.0 (72.9-90.9) L/h, central volume of distribution of 64.2 (50.6-81.0) L, intercompartment clearance of 116.4 (90.6-156.0) L/h, and peripheral volume of distribution of 167 (132-217) L. No serious adverse reactions or hemodynamic changes requiring the discontinuation of dexmedetomidine were observed. Dexmedetomidine had increased clearance and volume of distribution in mechanically ventilated children in ICU after neurosurgery, thereby indicating the need to adjust the dosage to obtain a target plasma concentration.

N2  - We present an innovative and robust solution to both biometric and emotion  identification using the electrocardiogram (ECG). The ECG represents the electrical signal that comes from the contraction of the heart muscles, indirectly representing the flow of blood inside the heart, it is known to convey a key that allows biometric identification. Moreover, due to its relationship with the nervous system, it also varies as a function of the emotional state. The use of information-theoretic data models, associated with data compression algorithms, allowed to effectively compare ECG records and infer the person identity, as well as emotional state at the time of data collection. The proposed method does not require ECG wave delineation or alignment, which reduces preprocessing error. The method is divided into three steps: (1) conversion of the real-valued ECG record into a symbolic time-series, using a quantization process; (2) conditional compression of the symbolic representation of the ECG, using the symbolic ECG records stored in the database as reference; (3) identification of the ECG record class, using a 1-NN (nearest neighbor) classifier. We obtained over 98% of accuracy in biometric identification, whereas in emotion recognition we attained over 90%. Therefore, the method adequately identify the person, and his/her emotion. Also, the proposed method is flexible and may be adapted to different problems, by the alteration of the templates for training the model.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Technology in neurointensive care units can collect and store vast  amounts of complex patient data. The CHART-ADAPT project is aimed at developing technology that will allow for the collection, analysis and use of these big data at the patient's bedside in neurointensive care units. A requirement of this project is to automatically extract and transfer high-frequency waveform data (e.g. ICP) from monitoring equipment to high performance computing infrastructure for analysis. Currently, no agreed data standard exists in neurointensive care for the description of this type of data. In this pilot study, we investigated the use of Medical Waveform Format Encoding Rules (MFER- www.mfer.org-ISO 11073-92001) as a possible data standard for neurointensive care waveform data. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Several waveform formats were explored (e.g. XML, DICOM waveform) and evaluated for suitability given existing computing infrastructure constraints, e.g. NHS network capacity and the processing capabilities of existing integration software. Key requirements of the format included a compact data size and the use of a recognised standard. The MFER waveform format (ISO/TS 11073-92001) met both requirements. To evaluate the practicality of the MFER waveform format, seven waveform signals (ICP, ECG, ART, CVP, EtCO2, Pleth, Resp) collected over a period of 8 h from a patient at the Institute of Neurological Sciences in Glasgow were converted into MFER waveform format. RESULTS: The MFER waveform format has two main components: sampling information and frame information. Sampling information describes the frequency of the data sampling and the resolution of the data. Frame information describes the data itself; it consists of three elements: data block (the actual data), channel (each type of waveform data occupies a channel) and sequence (the repetition of the data). All seven waveform signals were automatically and successfully converted into the MFER waveform format. One MFER file was created for each minute of data (total of 479 files, 181 KB each). CONCLUSIONS: The MFER waveform format has potential as a lightweight standard for representing high-frequency neurointensive care waveform data. Further work will include a comparison with other waveform data formats and a live trial of using the MFER waveform format to stream patient data over a longer period.

N2  - PURPOSE: To investigate whether electrocardiogram (ECG)-gated single- and  dual-heartbeat computed tomography coronary angiography (CTCA) with automatic exposure control (AEC) yields images with uniform image noise at reduced radiation doses. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using an anthropomorphic chest CT phantom we performed prospectively ECG-gated single- and dual-heartbeat CTCA on a second-generation 320-multidetector CT volume scanner. The exposure phase window was set at 75%, 70-80%, 40-80%, and 0-100% and the heart rate at 60 or 80 or corr80 bpm; images were reconstructed with filtered back projection (FBP) or iterative reconstruction (IR, adaptive iterative dose reduction 3D). We applied AEC and set the image noise level to 20 or 25 HU. For each technique we determined the image noise and the radiation dose to the phantom center. RESULTS: With half-scan reconstruction at 60 bpm, a 70-80% phase window- and a 20-HU standard deviation (SD) setting, the imagenoise level and -variation along the z axis manifested similar curves with FBP and IR. With half-scan reconstruction, the radiation dose to the phantom center with 70-80% phase window was 18.89 and 12.34 mGy for FBP and 4.61 and 3.10 mGy for IR at an SD setting SD of 20 and 25 HU, respectively. At 80 bpm with two-segment reconstruction the dose was approximately twice that of 60 bpm at both SD settings. However, increasing radiation dose at corr80 bpm was suppressed to 1.39 times compared to 60 bpm. CONCLUSION: AEC at ECG-gated single- and dual-heartbeat CTCA controls the image noise at different radiation dose.

N2  - A ballistocardiograph records the mechanical activity of the heart. We present a  novel algorithm for the detection of individual heart beats and beat-to-beat interval lengths in ballistocardiograms (BCGs) from healthy subjects. An automatic training step based on unsupervised learning techniques is used to extract the shape of a single heart beat from the BCG. Using the learned parameters, the occurrence of individual heart beats in the signal is detected. A final refinement step improves the accuracy of the estimated beat-to-beat interval lengths. Compared to many existing algorithms, the new approach offers heart rate estimates on a beat-to-beat basis. The agreement of the proposed algorithm with an ECG reference has been evaluated. A relative beat-to-beat interval error of 1.79% with a coverage of 95.94% was achieved on recordings from 16 subjects.

N2  - Energy harvesting devices are widely discussed as an alternative power source for  todays active implantable medical devices. Repeated battery replacement procedures can be avoided by extending the implants life span, which is the goal of energy harvesting concepts. This reduces the risk of complications for the patient and may even reduce device size. The continuous and powerful contractions of a human heart ideally qualify as a battery substitute. In particular, devices in close proximity to the heart such as pacemakers, defibrillators or bio signal (ECG) recorders would benefit from this alternative energy source. The clockwork of an automatic wristwatch was used to transform the hearts kinetic energy into electrical energy. In order to qualify as a continuous energy supply for the consuming device, the mechanism needs to demonstrate its harvesting capability under various conditions. Several in-vivo recorded heart motions were used as input of a mathematical model to optimize the clockworks original conversion efficiency with respect to myocardial contractions. The resulting design was implemented and tested during in-vitro and in-vivo experiments, which demonstrated the superior sensitivity of the new design for all tested heart motions.

N2  - For the development of a totally implantable ventricular assist system (VAS), we  have been developing the vibrating flow pump (VFP), which can generate oscillated blood flow with a relatively high frequency (10-50 Hz) for a totally implantable system. In this study, effects of left ventricular assistance with this unique oscillated blood flow were analyzed by nonlinear mathematics for evaluation as the entire circulatory regulatory system, not as a separate part of the system. Left heart bypasses using VFPs from the left atriums to the descending aortas were performed in chronic animal experiments using healthy adult goats. Electrocardiogram (ECG), arterial blood pressure, VFP pump flow, and flow of the descending aorta data taken while the goats were awake were recorded in the data recorder and analyzed in the personal computer system through the AD convertor. Using nonlinear mathematics, time series data were embedded into the phase space, and the Lyapunov numerical method, fractal dimension analysis, and power spectrum analysis were performed to evaluate the nonlinear dynamics. During left ventricular assistance with the VFP, Mayer wave fluctuations were decreased in the power spectrum, the fractal dimension of the hemodynamics was significantly decreased, and peripheral vascular resistance was significantly decreased. These results suggest that nonlinear dynamics, which mediate the cardiovascular dynamics, may be affected during LV bypass with oscillated flow. Decreased power of the Mayer wave in the spectrum caused the limit cycle attractor of the hemodynamics and decreased the peripheral resistance. Decreased sympathetic discharges may be the origin of the decreased Mayer wave and fractal dimension. These nonlinear dynamical analyses may be useful to design the optimal VAS control.

N2  - Cardiac activity has been monitored continuously in daily life by virtue of advanced  medical instruments with microelectromechanical system (MEMS) technology. Seismocardiography (SCG) has been considered to be free from the burden of measurement for cardiac activity, but it has been limited in its application in daily life. The most important issues regarding SCG are to overcome the limitations of motion artifacts due to the sensitivity of motion sensor. Although novel adaptive filters for noise cancellation have been developed, they depend on the researcher&rsquo;s subjective decision. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can extract significant features from data automatically without a researcher&rsquo;s subjective decision, so that signal processing has been recently replaced as CNNs. Thus, this study aimed to develop a novel method to enhance heart rate estimation from thoracic movement by CNNs. Thoracic movement was measured by six-axis accelerometer and gyroscope signals using a wearable sensor that can be worn by simply clipping on clothes. The dataset was collected from 30 participants (15 males, 15 females) using 12 measurement conditions according to two physical conditions (i.e., relaxed and aroused conditions), three body postures (i.e., sitting, standing, and supine), and six movement speeds (i.e., 3.2, 4.5, 5.8, 6.4, 8.5, and 10.3 km/h). The motion data (i.e., six-axis accelerometer and gyroscope) and heart rate (i.e., electrocardiogram (ECG)) were determined as the input data and labels in the dataset, respectively. The CNN model was developed based on VGG Net and optimized by testing according to network depth and data augmentation. The ensemble network of the VGG-16 without data augmentation and the VGG-19 with data augmentation was determined as optimal architecture for generalization. As a result, the proposed method showed higher accuracy than the previous SCG method using signal processing in most measurement conditions. The three main contributions are as follows: (1) the CNN model enhanced heart rate estimation with the benefits of automatic feature extraction from the data; (2) the proposed method was compared with the previous SCG method using signal processing; (3) the method was tested in 12 measurement conditions related to daily motion for a more practical application.

N2  - EEG recordings are generally affected by interference from physiological and  non-physiological sources which may obscure underlying brain activity and hinder effective EEG analysis. In particular, cardiac interference can be caused by the electrical activity of the heart and/or cardiovascular activity related to blood flow. Successful EEG application in sports science settings requires a method for artifact removal that is automatic and flexible enough to be applied in a variety of acquisition conditions without requiring simultaneous ECG recordings that could restrict movement. We developed an automatic method for classifying and removing both electrical cardiac and cardiovascular artifacts (ARCI) that does not require additional ECG recording. Our method employs independent component analysis (ICA) to isolate data independent components (ICs) and identifies the artifactual ICs by evaluating specific IC features in the time and frequency domains. We applied ARCI to EEG datasets with cued artifacts and acquired during an eyes-closed condition. Data were recorded using a standard EEG wet cap with either 128 or 64 electrodes and using a novel dry electrode cap with either 97 or 64 dry electrodes. All data were decomposed into different numbers of components to evaluate the effect of ICA decomposition level on effective cardiac artifact detection. ARCI performance was evaluated by comparing automatic ICs classifications with classifications performed by experienced investigators. Automatic and investigator classifications were highly consistent resulting in an overall accuracy greater than 99% in all datasets and decomposition levels, and an average sensitivity greater than 90%. Best results were attained when data were decomposed into a fewer number of components where the method achieved perfect sensitivity (100%). Performance was also evaluated by comparing automatic component classification with externally recorded ECG. Results showed that ICs automatically classified as artifactual were significantly correlated with ECG activity whereas the other ICs were not. We also assessed that the interference affecting EEG signals was reduced by more than 82% after automatic artifact removal. Overall, ARCI represents a significant step in the detection and removal of cardiac-related EEG artifacts and can be applied in a variety of acquisition settings making it ideal for sports science applications.

N2  - The calcium burden as estimated from non-ECG-synchronized computed tomography (CT)  exams acquired in screening of heavy smokers has been shown to be a strong predictor of cardiovascular events. We present a method for automatic coronary calcium scoring with low-dose, non-contrast-enhanced, non-ECG-synchronized chest CT. First, a probabilistic coronary calcium map was created using multi-atlas segmentation. This map assigned an a priori probability for the presence of coronary calcifications at every location in a scan. Subsequently, a statistical pattern recognition system was designed to identify coronary calcifications by texture, size, and spatial features; the spatial features were computed using the coronary calcium map. The detected calcifications were quantified in terms of volume and Agatston score. The best results were obtained by merging the results of three different supervised classification systems, namely direct classification with a nearest neighbor classifier, and two-stage classification with nearest neighbor and support vector machine classifiers.We used a total of 231 test scans containing 45,674 mm³ of coronary calcifications. The presented method detected on average 157/198 mm³ (sensitivity 79.2%) of coronary calcium volume with on average 4 mm false positive volume. Calcium scoring can be performed automatically in low-dose, non-contrast enhanced, non-ECG-synchronized chest CT in screening of heavy smokers to identify subjects who might benefit from preventive treatment.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Critical value reporting has been widely adopted by hospitals throughout  the world, but there were few reports about neonatal critical values. This study aimed to analyze characteristics of the neonatal critical values considered at our center and to provide information on improving neonatal intensive care. METHODS: A retrospective study of critical values at a newborn tertiary center in China was conducted to assess neonatal critical values according to test, distribution, reporting time, patient outcome and the impact to the therapy. RESULTS: In total, 926 critical values were recorded. Overall, 66.52% (616/926) of the items were reported within 24 hours of admission, 50.28% (465/926) during duty times and 54.75% (507/926) in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). The routine coagulation test was the most frequent source of critical values. Electrocardiography, blood gas analysis and therapeutic drug monitoring of drug levels were associated with the highest rates of treatment intervention (100%); routine coagulation tests were the lowest (23.14%). Sample quality was the main cause of false-positive critical values. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of neonatal critical values peaked during the first 24 hours post-admission and during duty periods. Each newborn center needs to enact rapid treatment guidelines to address common critical values in order to facilitate clinical interventions. Periodically reviewing critical values could help to optimize clinical practices.

N2  - Using BRAVO algorithm (AMPS-LLC, NY, v4.4.0), 5223 ECGs from a publicly available  annotated dataset from a randomized clinical trial on four different compounds and placebo were analyzed. ECGs were automatically processed and JTp interval was computed on: 12 standard ECG leads, Vector Magnitude (VM), and root mean square (RMS) leads. On VM and RMS, JTp intervals were nearly identical (228 ± 29 vs. 227 ± 30 ms respectively, with correlation of 0.99, p < 0.0001). On lead II, JTp interval was about 10 ms longer, but highly correlated with that measured on VM (0.94, p < 0.0001). Similarly, on lead V5, JTp was about 8 ms longer than on VM, with a correlation of 0.95, p < 0.0001. When compared to the public available annotations, JTp by BRAVO generated longer (about 8 ms) measurement and evidenced outliers conducible to both the T-wave peak (in few ECGs presenting notched shapes) and, to a lesser degree, to the J point, due to variability of the two algorithms. Differences on the drug-induced effect from the four compounds were negligible.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: In 2006 the apnea of prematurity (AOP) consensus group identified  inaccurate counting of apnea episodes as a major barrier to progress in AOP research. We compare nursing records of AOP to events detected by a clinically validated computer algorithm that detects apnea from standard bedside monitors. STUDY DESIGN: Waveform, vital sign, and alarm data were collected continuously from all very low-birth-weight infants admitted over a 25-month period, analyzed for central apnea, bradycardia, and desaturation (ABD) events, and compared with nursing documentation collected from charts. Our algorithm defined apnea as > 10 seconds if accompanied by bradycardia and desaturation. RESULTS: Of the 3,019 nurse-recorded events, only 68% had any algorithm-detected ABD event. Of the 5,275 algorithm-detected prolonged apnea events > 30 seconds, only 26% had nurse-recorded documentation within 1 hour. Monitor alarms sounded in only 74% of events of algorithm-detected prolonged apnea events > 10 seconds. There were 8,190,418 monitor alarms of any description throughout the neonatal intensive care unit during the 747 days analyzed, or one alarm every 2 to 3 minutes per nurse. CONCLUSION: An automated computer algorithm for continuous ABD quantitation is a far more reliable tool than the medical record to address the important research questions identified by the 2006 AOP consensus group.

N2  - We report on two new physiological phenomena: the long-term and total heart rate  asymmetry, which describe a significantly larger contribution of heart rate accelerations to long-term and total heart rate variability. In addition to the existing pair of indices, SD1(d); SD1(a); which are based on partitioning short-term variance, we introduce two other pairs of descriptors based on partitioning longterm (SD2(d); SD2(a)) and total (SDNN(d); SDNN(a)) heart rate variability. The new asymmetric descriptors are used to analyze RR intervals time series derived from the 30-min ECG recordings of 241 healthy subjects resting in supine position. It is shown that both new types of asymmetry are present in 76% of the subjects. The new phenomena reported here are real physiological findings rather than artifacts of the method since they vanish after data shuffling.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Although the autonomic nervous system plays a key role in mediating  cardiovascular changes during obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) activity during sleep apnea has not yet been sufficiently investigated. This study is to discuss the relationship between PNS activity and OSA. METHODS: Polysomnography recording was carried out in 76 patients (71 male and 5 female) with OSA. Cumulative PNS activity during sleep for each patient was derived from time series data of electrocardiogram (ECG) and analyzed by coarse graining spectral analysis of heart rate variability. The correlation between cumulative PNS activity and apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) was then discussed. RESULTS: Cumulative PNS activity and PNS peaks during sleep were lowly but significantly correlated with OSA severity (r=-0.344, p<0.005; and r=-0.266, p<0.05 respectively), and a linear regression equation could be established. Furthermore, significant correlation was also observed in the adult groups and in the moderate and severe groups, but not in the juvenile and the elderly and mild groups. CONCLUSION: These findings indicated that PNS function was obviously influenced by OSA during sleep. Cumulative PNS activity level might also serve as a useful parameter for the evaluation of OSA.

N2  - The scaling (fractal) characteristics of electrocardiograms (ECG) provide  information complementary to traditional linear measurements (heart rate, repolarisation rate etc.) allowing them to discriminate signal changes induced pathologically or pharmacologically. Under such interventions scaling behaviour is described by multiple local scaling exponents and the signal is termed multifractal. Exercise testing is used extensively to quantify and monitor cardiorespiratory health, yet to our knowledge there has been no previous multifractal investigation of exercise-induced changes in heart rate dynamics. Ambulatory ECGs were acquired from eight healthy participants. Linear descriptive statistics and a parameterisation of multifractal singularity spectra were determined for inter-beat (RR) and intra-beat (QT) time-series before and after exercise. Multivariate analyses of both linear and multifractal measures discriminated between pre- and post-exercise periods and proportionally more significant correlations were observed between linear than between multifractal measures. Variance was more uniformly distributed over the first three principal components for multifractal measures and the two classes of measures were uncorrelated. Order and phase randomisation of the time-series indicated that both sample distribution and correlation properties contribute to multifractalilty. This exploratory study indicates the possibility of using physical exercise in conjunction with multifractal methodology as an adjunctive description of autonomically mediated modulation of heart rate.

N2  - Acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) is a major public health problem throughout  the world and its importance is continuing to grow. More than 50% of ADHF patients have coronary artery disease, which is generally associated with a history of hypertension. Recent data suggest that half of the patients presenting with acute heart failure have preserved left ventricular systolic function. The diagnosis of ADHF may be difficult at times, and the clinical assessment and patient profiling is essential for appropriate therapy. Immediate therapeutic goals are not only to improve symptoms, restore oxygenation and stabilize hemodynamic conditions, but also to improve short- and long-term survival. In addition to general supportive measures such as oxygen supplementation, noninvasive ventilation, analgesia, diuretics, vasodilators together with inotropic agents and/or vasopressors remain the cornerstone of therapy in patients with ADHF.

N2  - A novel R-peak detection algorithm suitable for wearable electrocardiogram (ECG)  devices is proposed with four objectives: robustness to noise, low latency processing, low resource complexity, and automatic tuning of parameters. The approach is a two-pronged algorithm comprising (1) triangle template matching to accentuate the slope information of the R-peaks and (2) a single moving average filter to define a dynamic threshold for peak detection. The proposed algorithm was validated on eight ECG public databases. The obtained results not only presented good accuracy, but also low resource complexity, all of which show great potential for detection R-peaks in ECG signals collected from wearable devices.

N2  - Automatic detection of ectopic beats has become a thoroughly researched topic, with  literature providing manifold proposals typically incorporating morphological analysis of the electrocardiogram (ECG). Although being well understood, its utilization is often neglected, especially in practical monitoring situations like online evaluation of signals acquired in wearable sensors. Continuous blood pressure estimation based on pulse wave velocity considerations is a prominent example, which depends on careful fiducial point extraction and is therefore seriously affected during periods of increased occurring extrasystoles. In the scope of this work, a novel ectopic beat discriminator with low computational complexity has been developed, which takes advantage of multimodal features derived from ECG and pulse wave relating measurements, thereby providing additional information on the underlying cardiac activity. Moreover, the blood pressure estimations' vulnerability towards ectopic beats is closely examined on records drawn from the Physionet database as well as signals recorded in a small field study conducted in a geriatric facility for the elderly. It turns out that a reliable extrasystole identification is essential to unsupervised blood pressure estimation, having a significant impact on the overall accuracy. The proposed method further convinces by its applicability to battery driven hardware systems with limited processing power and is a favorable choice when access to multimodal signal features is given anyway.

N2  - Electrocardiogram (ECG) is a convenient, economic, and non-invasive detecting tool  in myocardial ischemia (MI). Its clinical appearance is mainly exhibited by ST-T complex change. MI events are usually instantaneous and asymptomatic in some cases, which cannot be forecasted to have a precautionary measure in time by doctors. The automatic detection of MI by computer and a cued warning of danger in real time play an important role in diagnosing heart disease. With the help of the medical staff, some quantitative approbatory indicators, such as ST-segment deviation, the amplitude of T-wave peak and the rate of ST and heart rate (HR), were combined to judge MI using fuzzy reasoning. After MIT-BIH database and the long-term ST database (LTST) verification, sensitivity and positive predictive values reached 75% and 78% respectively, and specificity and negative predictive values were 85% and 87% respectively. In addition, the proposed method was close to human way of thinking and understanding, and easy to apply in clinical detection and engineering fields.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Continuous ischemia monitoring helps identify patients with acute, but  often silent, myocardial ischemia. Evidence suggests nurses do not activate ischemia monitoring because they think it is difficult to use. ST-Map software incorporates graphic displays to make monitoring of ongoing ischemia easier. OBJECTIVES: To determine if nurses' use of and attitude toward ischemia monitoring and the quality of patient care improve with use of ST-Map. METHODS: The study included 61 nurses and 202 patients with acute coronary syndrome in a cardiac intensive care unit. Baseline data on nurses' use of and attitude toward ischemia monitoring and quality of care were obtained. Education was then provided and ST-Map software was installed on all monitors. Follow-up data were obtained 4 months later. RESULTS: The percentage of nurses who had ever used ischemia monitoring was 13% before ST Map and 90% afterward (P < .001). The most common reason for not using ischemia monitoring before ST Map was inadequate knowledge (62%). The most common reason for liking ischemia monitoring after ST Map was knowing when a patient has ischemia (80%). Time to acquisition of a 12-lead electrocardiogram in response to symptoms or ST-segment changes was 5 to 15 minutes before ST Map and always less than 5 minutes afterward (P < .001). Time to return to the catheterization laboratory did not differ before and after ST Map. CONCLUSIONS: ST Map was associated with more frequent use of ischemia monitoring, improved attitudes of nurses toward ischemia monitoring, and shorter time to obtaining 12-lead electrocardiograms.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the influence of 2nd-degree AV blocks (AVB) on RR  interval-based heart rate variability (HRV) variables; to investigate the effect of using PP interval time series and of artifact filtering on HRV analyses; to investigate the influence of electrocardiogram (ECG) recording length and time of recording; and to calculate day-to-day variability and reference intervals of HRV variables. ANIMALS: Thirty healthy adult horses. METHODS: RR and PP interval time series were extracted from 10-h Holter ECGs and an automated filter was applied to the RR time series (RR(f)). Time-domain HRV variables were calculated based on RR, PP, and RR(f) time series and their relation to the number of AVBs was assessed. Hourly 10- and 60-min segments were extracted to investigate the influence of segment length and recording time on HRV variables. Day-to-day variability and reference intervals of HRV variables were calculated. RESULTS: Variables of short-term HRV were significantly influenced by the number of AVBs when based on RR, but not when based on PP- and RR(f) time series. PP- and RR(f)-based HRV variables were in good agreement. The majority of HRV variables were influenced by recording time and ECG segment length. Day-to-day variability of HRV variables was low when based on 10-h ECG recordings but moderate to high when based on 60-min and 10-min recordings. CONCLUSIONS: Second-degree AVBs significantly influence conventional RR-based, but not PP- and RR(f)-based time-domain HRV variables. However, PP and RR(f) analyses have limitations and recording length and time of recording must be considered.

N2  - DATABASE: The efficiency and robustness of the proposed method has been tested on  Fantasia Database (FTD), MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database (MIT-AD), and MIT-BIH Normal Sinus Rhythm Database (MIT-NSD). AIM: Because of the importance of QRS complex in the diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases, improvement in accuracy of its measurement has been set as a target. The present study provides an algorithm for automatic detection of QRS complex on the ECG signal, with the benefit of energy and reduced impact of noise on the ECG signal. METHOD: The method is basically based on the Teager energy operator (TEO), which facilitates the detection of the baseline threshold and extracts QRS complex from the ECG signal. RESULTS: The testing of the undertaken method on the Fanatasia Database showed the following results: sensitivity (Se) = 99.971%, positive prediction (P+) = 99.973%, detection error rate (DER) = 0.056%, and accuracy (Acc) = 99.944%. On MIT-AD involvement, Se = 99.74%, P+ = 99.97%, DER = 0.291%, and Acc = 99.71%. On MIT-NSD involvement, Se = 99.878%, P+ = 99.989%, DER = 0.134%, and Acc = 99.867%. CONCLUSION: Despite the closeness of the recorded peaks which inflicts a constraint in detection of the two consecutive QRS complexes, the proposed method, by applying 4 simple and quick steps, has effectively and reliably detected the QRS complexes which make it suitable for practical purposes and applications.

N2  - This study sought to employ a novel approach based on joint symbolic dynamics (JSD)  to study the influence of respiratory phase on baroreflex function. We recorded electrocardiograms (ECG), blood pressure and respiration in 10 (5 male/5 female) healthy experienced athletes. For our analysis, time series of R-R intervals and systolic blood pressure were extracted, and respiratory phases were obtained using the Hilbert transform. Based on the changes between successive values, each series was transformed into binary symbol vectors, and words of length '2' were formed. From parallel analysis of the symbolic dynamics in the three time series, the relationship between respiratory phases and baroreflex function was quantified. We analysed baroreflex patterns via different word combinations for specific respiratory phases and observed that baroreflex patterns occurred at similar frequency during expiration, inspiration and phase transitions (25.0±14.4% vs. 33.4±19.5%, expiration-inspiration: 25.0±12.6% and inspiration-expiration: 22.1±17.4%, respectively). From this study, it appears that JSD provides a novel and efficient technique for the combined analysis of interactions between respiration, heart rate and blood pressure.

N2  - Cuff-less blood pressure (BP) monitoring is increasingly being needed for  cardiovascular events management in clinical. Many of the existing methods, however, are based on manual feature extraction, which cannot characterize the complex relationship between the physiological signals and BP. In this study, the 16-layer VGGNet was used to construct cuff-less BP from electrocardiogram (ECG) and pressure pulse wave (PPW) signals, with no need extract features from raw signals. The deep network architecture has the ability of automatic feature learning, and the learned features are the higher-level abstract description of low-level raw physiological signals. Eight-nine middle-aged and elderly subjects were enrolled to evaluate the performance of the proposed BP estimation method, with oscillometric technique-based BP as a reference. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method had a commendable accuracy in BP estimation, with a correlation coefficient of 0.91 and an estimation error of -2.06 ± 6.89 mmHg for systolic BP, and 0.89 and -4.66 ± 4.91 mmHg for diastolic BP. This study shows that the proposed method provided a potential novel insight for the cuff-less BP estimation.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: We evaluated ST-segment monitoring to detect clinical decompensation in  infants with single ventricle anatomy. We proposed a signal processing algorithm for ST-segment instability and hypothesized that instability is associated with cardiopulmonary arrests. DESIGN: Retrospective, observational study. SETTING: Tertiary children's hospital 21-bed cardiovascular ICU and 36-bed step-down unit. PATIENTS: Twenty single ventricle infants who received stage 1 palliation surgery between January 2013 and January 2014. Twenty rapid response events resulting in cardiopulmonary arrests (arrest group) were recorded in 13 subjects, and nine subjects had no interstage cardiopulmonary arrest (control group). INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Arrest data were collected over the 4-hour time window prior to cardiopulmonary arrest. Control data were collected from subjects with no interstage arrest using the 4-hour time window prior to cardiovascular ICU discharge. A paired subgroup analysis was performed comparing subject 4-hour windows prior to arrest (prearrest group) with 4-hour windows prior to discharge (postarrest group). Raw values of ST segments were compared between groups. A 3D ST-segment vector was created using three quasi-orthogonal leads (II, aVL, and V5). Magnitude and instability of this continuous vector were compared between groups. There was no significant difference in mean unprocessed ST-segment values in the arrest and control groups. Utilizing signal processing, there was an increase in the ST-vector magnitude (p = 0.02) and instability (p = 0.008) in the arrest group. In the paired subgroup analysis, there was an increase in the ST-vector magnitude (p = 0.05) and instability (p = 0.05) in the prearrest state compared with the postarrest state prior to discharge. CONCLUSIONS: In single ventricle patients, increased ST instability and magnitude were associated with rapid response events that required intervention for cardiopulmonary arrest, whereas conventional ST-segment monitoring did not differentiate an arrest from control state.

N2  - Earlier studies have shown that short term heart rate variability (HRV) analysis of  ECG seems promising for detection of epileptic seizures. A precise and accurate automatic R-peak detection algorithm is a necessity in a real-time, continuous measurement of HRV, in a portable ECG device. We used the portable CE marked ePatch® heart monitor to record the ECG of 14 patients, who were enrolled in the videoEEG long term monitoring unit for clinical workup of epilepsy. Recordings of the first 7 patients were used as training set of data for the R-peak detection algorithm and the recordings of the last 7 patients (467.6 recording hours) were used to test the performance of the algorithm. We aimed to modify an existing QRS-detection algorithm to a more precise R-peak detection algorithm to avoid the possible jitter Qand S-peaks can create in the tachogram, which causes error in short-term HRVanalysis. The proposed R-peak detection algorithm showed a high sensitivity (Se = 99.979%) and positive predictive value (P+ = 99.976%), which was comparable with a previously published QRS-detection algorithm for the ePatch® ECG device, when testing the same dataset. The novel R-peak detection algorithm designed to avoid jitter has very high sensitivity and specificity and thus is a suitable tool for a robust, fast, real-time HRV-analysis in patients with epilepsy, creating the possibility for real-time seizure detection for these patients.

N2  - The discrimination between ventricular (VT) and supraventricular tachycardia (SVT)  and the evaluation of their hemodynamic impact are essential issues in the arrhythmia management. A new pacing device features a tachycardia diagnostic system relying on simultaneous recording of the transvalvular impedance (TVI) and a special integrated electric signal derived by the whole set of endocardial electrodes (iECG). The iECG waveform is sensitive to the pattern of ventricular activation, similarly to the surface ECG. The TVI increases in systole and decreases in diastole and the amplitude of this cyclic fluctuation is an expression of the effectiveness of the pump function. In order to test the value of these signals in the analysis of a tachycardia, we have assessed the iECG and TVI modifications induced by different SVTs and tolerated and non-tolerated VTs, during electrophysiological (EP) studies. In case of SVT, the ventricular component of the iECG maintained the same morphology as in sinus rhythm. The peak-peak amplitude of the TVI fluctuation was reduced to 66 ± 11 % of the individual sinus rhythm reference, but the signal was present at every beat and showed a remarkable stability (variation coefficient 0.19 ± 0.01). In case of VT, the ventricular component of the iECG was strikingly different than in sinus rhythm. Regular TVI fluctuation was observed with tolerated VTs (peak-peak amplitude 74 ± 6 %; variation coefficient 0.21 ± 0.04). In contrast, with non-tolerated VTs the TVI amplitude was depressed below 40%, and the signal was virtually absent in the event of very fast VT or VF. Our results confirm that the iECG is a reliable tool to quickly discriminate VTs from SVTs and that TVI can provide information on the severity of the hemodynamic impairment produced by a tachycardia, with potential clinical benefit in the follow-up of pacemaker patients. Furthermore, the application of these signals to automatic algorithms of arrhythmia recognition might improve the specificity of therapy administration by an implantable defibrillator (ICD).

N2  - False and non-actionable alarms in critical care can be reduced by developing  algorithms which assess the trueness of an arrhythmia alarm from a bedside monitor. Computational approaches that automatically identify artefacts in ECG signals are an important branch of physiological signal processing which tries to address this issue. Signal quality indices (SQIs) derived considering differences between artefacts which occur in ECG signals and normal QRS morphology have the potential to discriminate pathologically different arrhythmic ECG segments as artefacts. Using ECG signals from the PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2015 training set, we studied previously reported ECG SQIs in the scientific literature to differentiate ECG segments with artefacts from arrhythmic ECG segments. We found that the ability of SQIs to discriminate between ECG artefacts and arrhythmic ECG varies based on arrhythmia type since the pathology of each arrhythmic ECG waveform is different. Therefore, to reduce the risk of SQIs classifying arrhythmic events as noise it is important to validate and test SQIs with databases that include arrhythmias. Arrhythmia specific SQIs may also minimize the risk of misclassifying arrhythmic events as noise.

N2  - This paper presents a novel method for automatic identification of motion artifact  beats in ECG recordings. The proposed method is based on the ECG complexes clustering, fuzzy logic and multi-parameters decision. Firstly, eight simulated datasets with different signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) were built for identification experiments. Results show that the identification sensitivity of our method is sensitive to SNR levels and acts like a low-pass filter that matches the cardiologists' recognition, while the Norm FP rate and PVB FP rate keep significantly low regardless of SNR. Furthermore, a simulated dataset including random durations of motion activities superimposed segments and two clinical datasets acquired from two different commercial recorders were adopted for the evaluation of accuracy and robustness. The overall identification results on these datasets were: sensitivity >94.69%, Norm FP rate <0.60% and PVB FP rate <2.65%. All the results were obtained without any manual threshold adjustment according to the priori information, thus dissolving the drawbacks of previous published methods. Additionally, the total cost time of our method applied to 24 h recordings is less than 1 s, which is extremely suitable in the situation of magnanimity data in long-term ECG recordings.

N2  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: ECG is one of the biometric signals that has been studied  in peer-reviewed over past years. The developments on the signal analysis methods show that the studies on the ECG would continue unabatedly. It has a common use on cardiac diseases with high rates of classification performances by integrating it with signal analysis methods. The aim of the study is to utilize the ECG for human identification. METHODS: Second Order Difference Plot (SODP) is a non-linear time-series analysis method that allows determining the features using the statistical analysis of the wave distributions. The SODP features were extracted using different quantification methods for ECG-based human identification. A new quantification approach has been proposed on the SODP for ECG-based human identification. The proposed method, Logarithmic Grid Analysis, was compared with the existing quantification methods on the SODP. The region of the SODP was divided into sub-regions with logarithmically increasing distances and the numbers of data points in each logarithmic sub regions were calculated in the proposed method. Three different databases were used to test the validity of the method. These records have been tested with the conventional feature extraction methods on the SODP. The long-term ECG signals were divided into 5-s short-term ECG signals. RESULTS: The Logarithmic Grid Analysis features that were counted from short-time ECG signals were classified with k-Nearest Neighbor algorithm using 10-fold cross validation, and the identification performance of the proposed model was evaluated. Consequently, high accuracy rates of 91.96%, 99.86% and 95.12% were achieved on ECG-based human identification using the Logarithmic Grid Analysis method on the SODP. CONCLUSIONS: The density score of data points at the center of the SODP is too high. This case increases the importance of the regions close the center in order to find the detailed and significant features from the SODP. The number of data points at the center has been extracted in more detail and the vertex areas of the major axes of the SODP can be interpreted in the aggregate sub-regions by using logarithmically increasing distances with a small number of feature size.

N2  - The Karhunen-Loève transform (KLT) is applied to study the ventricular  repolarisation period as reflected in the ST-T complex of the surface ECG. The KLT coefficients provide a sensitive means of quantitating ST-T shapes. A training set of ST-T complexes is used to derive a set of KLT basis vectors that permits representation of 90% of the signal energy using four KLT coefficients. As a truncated KLT expansion tends to favor representation of the signal over any additive noise, a time series of KLT coefficients obtained from successive ST-T complexes is better suited for representation of both medium-term variations (such as ischemic changes) and short-term variations (such as ST-T alternans) than discrete parameters such as the ST level or other local indices. For analysis of ischemic changes, an adaptive filter is described that can be used to estimate the KLT coefficient, yielding an increase in the signal-to-noise ratio of 10 dB (u = 0.1), with a convergence time of about three beats. A beat spectrum of the unfiltered KLT coefficient series is used for detection of ST-T alterans. These methods are illustrated with examples from the European ST-T Database. About 20% of records revealed quasi-periodic salvos of ischemic ST-T change episodes and another 20% exhibit repetitive, but not clearly periodic patterns of ST-T change episodes. About 5% of ischemic episodes were associated with ST-T alterans.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Systems providing computer-based analysis of the resting  electrocardiogram (ECG) seek to improve the quality of health care by providing accurate and timely automatic diagnosis of, for example, cardiac rhythm to clinicians. The accuracy of these diagnoses, however, remains questionable. OBJECTIVES: We tested the hypothesis that (a) 2 independent automated ECG systems have better accuracy in rhythm diagnosis than nonexpert clinicians and (b) both systems provide correct diagnostic suggestions in a large percentage of cases where the diagnosis of nonexpert clinicians is incorrect. METHODS: Five hundred ECGs were manually analyzed by 2 senior experts, 3 nonexpert clinicians, and automatically by 2 automated systems. The accuracy of the nonexpert rhythm statements was compared with the accuracy of each system statement. The proportion of rhythm statements when the clinician's diagnoses were incorrect and the systems instead provided correct diagnosis was assessed. RESULTS: A total of 420 sinus rhythms and 156 rhythm disturbances were recognized by expert reading. Significance of the difference in accuracy between nonexperts and systems was P = .45 for system A and P = .11 for system B. The percentage of correct automated diagnoses in cases when the clinician was incorrect was 28% ± 10% for system A and 25% ± 11% for system B (P = .09). CONCLUSION: The rhythm diagnoses of automated systems did not reach better average accuracy than those of nonexpert readings. The computer diagnosis of rhythm can be incorrect in cases where the clinicians fail in reaching the correct ECG diagnosis.

N2  - Cardiac death risk is still a big problem by an important part of the population,  especially in elderly patients. In this study, we propose to characterize and analyze the cardiovascular and cardiorespiratory systems using the Poincaré plot. A total of 46 cardiomyopathy patients and 36 healthy subjets were analyzed. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was used to stratify patients with low risk (LR: LVEF > 35%, 16 patients), and high risk (HR: LVEF ≤ 35%, 30 patients) of heart attack. RR, SBP and T(Tot) time series were extracted from the ECG, blood pressure and respiratory flow signals, respectively. Parameters that describe the scatterplott of Poincaré method, related to short- and long-term variabilities, acceleration and deceleration of the dynamic system, and the complex correlation index were extracted. The linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and the support vector machines (SVM) classification methods were used to analyze the results of the extracted parameters. The results showed that cardiac parameters were the best to discriminate between HR and LR groups, especially the complex correlation index (p = 0.009). Analising the interaction, the best result was obtained with the relation between the difference of the standard deviation of the cardiac and respiratory system (p = 0.003). When comparing HR vs LR groups, the best classification was obtained applying SVM method, using an ANOVA kernel, with an accuracy of 98.12%. An accuracy of 97.01% was obtained by comparing patients versus healthy, with a SVM classifier and Laplacian kernel. The morphology of Poincaré plot introduces parameters that allow the characterization of the cardiorespiratory system dynamics.

N2  - We present generalizations of our previously published artificial models for  generating multi-channel ECG to provide simulations of abnormal cardiac rhythms. Using a three-dimensional vectorcardiogram (VCG) formulation, we generate the normal cardiac dipole for a patient using a sum of Gaussian kernels, fitted to real VCG recordings. Abnormal beats are specified either as perturbations to the normal dipole or as new dipole trajectories. Switching between normal and abnormal beat types is achieved using a first-order Markov chain. Probability transitions can be learned from real data or modeled by coupling to heart rate and sympathovagal balance. Natural morphology changes from beat-to-beat are incorporated by varying the angular frequency of the dipole as a function of the inter-beat (RR) interval. The RR interval time series is generated using our previously described model whereby time- and frequency-domain heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability characteristics can be specified. QT-HR hysteresis is simulated by coupling the Gaussian kernels associated with the T-wave in the model with a nonlinear factor related to the local HR (determined from the last n RR intervals). Morphology changes due to respiration are simulated by introducing a rotation matrix couple to the respiratory frequency. We demonstrate an example of the use of this model by simulating HR-dependent T-wave alternans (TWA) with and without phase-switching due to ectopy. Application of our model also reveals previously unreported effects of common TWA estimation methods.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Identifying hospitalized patients at risk for QT interval prolongation  could lead to interventions to reduce the risk of torsades de pointes. Our objective was to develop and validate a risk score for QT prolongation in hospitalized patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this study, in a single tertiary care institution, consecutive patients (n=900) admitted to cardiac care units comprised the risk score development group. The score was then applied to 300 additional patients in a validation group. Corrected QT (QTc) interval prolongation (defined as QTc>500 ms or an increase of >60 ms from baseline) occurred in 274 (30.4%) and 90 (30.0%) patients in the development group and validation group, respectively. Independent predictors of QTc prolongation included the following: female (odds ratio, 1.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-2.0), diagnosis of myocardial infarction (2.4 [1.6-3.9]), septic shock (2.7 [1.5-4.8]), left ventricular dysfunction (2.7 [1.6-5.0]), administration of a QT-prolonging drug (2.8 [2.0-4.0]), ≥2 QT-prolonging drugs (2.6 [1.9-5.6]), or loop diuretic (1.4 [1.0-2.0]), age >68 years (1.3 [1.0-1.9]), serum K⁺ <3.5 mEq/L (2.1 [1.5-2.9]), and admitting QTc >450 ms (2.3; confidence interval [1.6-3.2]). Risk scores were developed by assigning points based on log odds ratios. Low-, moderate-, and high-risk ranges of 0 to 6, 7 to 10, and 11 to 21 points, respectively, best predicted QTc prolongation (C statistic=0.823). A high-risk score ≥11 was associated with sensitivity=0.74, specificity=0.77, positive predictive value=0.79, and negative predictive value=0.76. In the validation group, the incidences of QTc prolongation were 15% (low risk); 37% (moderate risk); and 73% (high risk). CONCLUSIONS: A risk score using easily obtainable clinical variables predicts patients at highest risk for QTc interval prolongation and may be useful in guiding monitoring and treatment decisions.

N2  - Introduction Carbon monoxide poisoning may cause myocardial toxicity and cardiac  autonomic dysfunction, which may contribute to the development of life-threatening arrhythmias. We investigated the potential association between acute carbon monoxide exposure and cardiac autonomic function measured by heart rate variability. METHOD: The present study included 40 children aged 1-17 years who were admitted to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit with acute carbon monoxide poisoning and 40 healthy age- and sex-matched controls. Carboxyhaemoglobin and cardiac enzymes were measured at admission. Electrocardiography was performed on admission and discharge, and 24-hour Holter electrocardiography was digitally recorded. Heart rate variability was analysed at both time points - 24-hour recordings - and frequency domains - from the first 5 minutes of intensive care unit admission. RESULTS: Time domain and frequency indices such as high-frequency spectral power and low-frequency spectral power were similar between patient and control groups (p>0.05). The ratio of low-frequency spectral power to high-frequency spectral power was significantly lower in the carbon monoxide poisoning group (p<0.001) and was negatively correlated with carboxyhaemoglobin levels (r=-0.351, p<0.05). The mean heart rate, QT dispersion, corrected QT dispersion, and P dispersion values were higher in the carbon monoxide poisoning group (p<0.05) on admission. The QT dispersion and corrected QT dispersion remained longer in the carbon monoxide poisoning group compared with controls on discharge (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: The frequency domain indices, especially the ratio of low-frequency spectral power to high-frequency spectral power, are useful for the evaluation of the cardiac autonomic function. The decreased low-frequency spectral power-to-high-frequency spectral power ratio reflects a balance of the autonomic nervous system, which shifted to parasympathetic components.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Assessment of heart rate variability by means of deceleration capacity  (DC) provides a noninvasive probe of cardiac autonomic activity. However, clinical use of DC is limited by the need of manual review of the ECG signals to eliminate artifacts, noise, and nonstationarities. OBJECTIVE: To validate a novel approach to fully automatically assess DC from noisy, nonstationary signals METHODS: We analyzed 100 randomly selected ECG tracings recorded for 10 minutes by routine monitor devices (GE DASH 4000, sample size 100 Hz) in a medical emergency department. We used a novel automated R-peak detection algorithm, which is mainly based on a Shannon energy envelope estimator and a Hilbert transformation. We transformed the automatically generated RR interval time series by phase-rectified signal averaging (PRSA) to assess DC of heart rate (DCauto ). DCauto was compared to DCmanual , which was obtained from the same manually preprocessed ECG signals. RESULTS: DCauto and DCmanual showed good correlation and agreement, particularly if a low-pass filter was implemented into the PRSA algorithm. Correlation coefficient between DCauto and DCmanual was 0.983 (P < 0.0001). Average difference between DCauto and DCmanual was -0.23±0.49 ms with limits of agreement ranging from -1.19 to 0.73 ms. Significantly lower correlations were observed when a different R-peak detection algorithm or conventional heart rate variability (HRV) measures were tested. CONCLUSIONS: DC can be fully automatically assessed from noisy, nonstationary ECG signals.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: The ability to detect left ventricular (LV) apical dyskinesis, the  hallmark of an aneurysm, is an important requirement of diagnostic cardiac imaging modalities that perform wall motion analysis. Our investigation assessed the ability of gated blood pool single-photon emission-computed tomography (GBPS) to automatically detect LV dyskinesis, using cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) as the reference standard. MATERIALS AND METHODS: GBPS data were analyzed for 41 patients with congestive heart failure or cardiomyopathy and compared with ECG-gated TrueFISP CMR evaluations. An experienced nuclear cardiologist without the knowledge of quantitative GBPS or CMR results graded visual impressions of regional wall motion while examining cinematic playbacks of GBPS images. GBPS algorithms automatically isolated LV counts and computed regional phase (phi) values in each of 17 conventional American Heart Association LV segments. LV asynchrony was quantified by the two local measures: maximum apical phi difference (Deltaalpha), and standard deviation among apical phases (sigmaalpha), and by the five global measures: varphi histogram bandwidth (BWHistogram), phi histogram standard deviation (sigmaHistogram), Z-scores, Entropy, and Synchrony. For CMR data, an expert manually drew endocardial LV outlines to measure regional wall motion in 17 LV segments. RESULTS: Apical dyskinesis was present in nine patients. Among GBPS measurements, the method with the greatest accuracy for detecting dyskinesis was Deltaalpha (receiver operating characteristic area=95%). The only method with a sufficiently high kappa statistic to represent 'very good agreement' with CMR was Deltaalpha, with kappa=0.81. Deltaalpha was more sensitive in detecting dyskinesis than visual analysis (100 vs. 33%, P=0.01). CONCLUSION: Automatic GBPS computations accurately identified patients with LV dyskinesis, and detected dyskinesis more successfully than did visual analysis.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Olanzapine is an atypical antipsychotic used for many years in the  treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Poisonings with this medicine can results with cardiotoxic effects in the form of ECG abnormalities. AIM OF THE STUDY: To evaluate the nature and incidence of electrocardiographic abnormalities in patients with acute olanzapine poisoning. MATERIAL: 23 adult (mean age 38.4 +/- 15.5 years) patients with acute olanzapine poisoning, including 10 men (30.4 +/- 8.1 years) and 11 women (45.7 +/- 17.2 years), where 1 man and 1 woman were poisoned twice. The toxic serum level of olanzapine (above 100 ng/mL) was confirmed in each patient. METHODS: Evaluation of electrocardiograms performed in patients in the first day of hospitalization with automatic measurement of durations of PQ, QRS and QTc and the identification of arrhythmias and conduction disorders on the basis of visual analysis of the ECG waveforms. Statistical analysis of the results using the methods of descriptive statistics. RESULTS: The mean durations of PQ, QRS and QTc in the study group were as follows: 135 +/- 23 ms, 91 +/- 12 ms, and 453 +/- 48 ms, respectively. The most common ECG abnormalities were prolonged QTc and supraventricular tachycardia (including sinus tachycardia) - each 22%; less common were ST-T changes (17%) and supraventricular premature complexes (9%), and only in individual cases (4%) ventricular premature complexes, bundle branch block, sinus bradycardia and atrial fibrillation were present. CONCLUSIONS: In the course of acute olanzapine poisonings: (1) prolonged QTc interval is quite common, but rarely leads to torsade de pointes tachycardia; (2) fast supraventricular rhythms are also common, but rarely cause irregular tachyarrhythmias, eg. atrial fibrillation; (3) conduction disorders (atrioventricular blocks, bundle branch blocks) are not typical abnormalities; (4) the observed ECG abnormalities emphasize the need of continuous ECG monitoring in these patients.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Optimization of stimulation parameters is essential to maximizing  therapeutic efficacy and minimizing side effects. METHODS: The ANTHEM-HF study enrolled patients with heart failure who received chronic autonomic regulation therapy (ART) with an implantable vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) system on either the right (n=30) or left side (n=29). Acute effects of continuously cycling VNS on R-R interval dynamics were evaluated using post hoc Poincaré analysis of ECG recordings collected during multiple titration sessions over an 8-12week period. During each titration session, VNS intensity associated with maximum tolerable dose was determined. Poincaré plots of R-R interval time series were created for epochs when VNS cycled from OFF to ON at varying intensity levels. RESULTS: VNS produced an immediate, relatively small change in beat-to-beat distribution of R-R intervals during the 14-sec ON time, which was correlated with stimulation current amplitude (r=0.85, p=0.05). During titration of right-sided stimulation, there was a strong correlation (r=0.91, p=0.01) between stimulus intensity and the Poincaré parameter of standard deviation, SD1, which is associated with high-frequency heart rate variability. The effect of VNS on instantaneous heart rate was indicated by a shift in the centroid of the beat-to-beat cloud distribution demarcated by the encircling ellipse. As anticipated, left-sided stimulation did not alter any Poincaré parameter except at high stimulation intensities (≥2mA). CONCLUSION: Quantitative Poincaré analysis reveals a tight coupling in beat-to-beat dynamics during VNS ON cycles that is directly related to stimulation intensity, providing a useful measurement for confirming autonomic engagement.

N2  - Sudden cardiac death (SCD) is one of the main causes of death among people. A new  methodology is presented for predicting the SCD based on ECG signals employing the wavelet packet transform (WPT), a signal processing technique, homogeneity index (HI), a nonlinear measurement for time series signals, and the Enhanced Probabilistic Neural Network classification algorithm. The effectiveness and usefulness of the proposed method is evaluated using a database of measured ECG data acquired from 20 SCD and 18 normal patients. The proposed methodology presents the following significant advantages: (1) compared with previous works, the proposed methodology achieves a higher accuracy using a single nonlinear feature, HI, thus requiring low computational resource for predicting an SCD onset in real-time, unlike other methodologies proposed in the literature where a large number of nonlinear features are used to predict an SCD event; (2) it is capable of predicting the risk of developing an SCD event up to 20 min prior to the onset with a high accuracy of 95.8%, superseding the prior 12 min prediction time reported recently, and (3) it uses the ECG signal directly without the need for transforming the signal to a heart rate variability signal, thus saving time in the processing.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Our aim is to better characterize the impact of sedation and its  interruption on continuously monitored heart rate variability and respiratory rate variability in critically ill patients. We aim to explore whether sedation reduces heart rate variability and respiratory rate variability in critically ill patients and whether the extent of reduction depends on degree of organ dysfunction. DESIGN: Prospective observational pilot study. SETTING: Intensive care unit in tertiary care teaching hospital. PATIENTS: Thirty-three critically ill adult patients experiencing respiratory and/or cardiac failure. INTERVENTIONS: Electrocardiogram and end-tidal capnography waveform capture were initiated from admission or intubation, respectively, and continued to intensive care unit discharge or a maximum of 14 d. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: All patient days with a sedation interruption (defined as cessation of a continuous infusion of sedation agent) were identified. Mean heart rate variability and respiratory rate variability were computed over two periods: 4 hrs directly prior to the sedation interruption, and the duration of sedation interruption (median: 1 hr 45 mins, interquartile range: 4 hrs 15 mins or max 4 hrs). Severity of organ dysfunction was assessed through multiple organ dysfunction syndrome scores, and sedative agents were recorded for each sedation interruption. Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome levels were defined as low (0-2), medium (3-4), and high (> 4). Variability before and during sedation interruption was compared and analyzed across multiple organ dysfunction syndrome levels and sedative types. Our results suggest that both heart rate variability and respiratory rate variability increased during sedation interruption (p < 0.05 for coefficient of variation). Patients with low and medium multiple organ dysfunction syndrome experienced greater increase in heart rate variability during sedation interruption (p < 0.05 for coefficient of variation), compared to patients with high multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, who failed to mount a significant increase in heart rate variability when sedation was stopped. Similarly, sedation interruption led to increased respiratory rate variability for low multiple organ dysfunction syndrome patients (p < 0.05 for SD), but in contrast, a further deterioration in respiratory rate variability occurred in the high multiple organ dysfunction syndrome patients. All trends persisted when controlling for sedative agents. CONCLUSIONS: Interruption of sedation allows for uncovering a greater restoration of heart rate variability and respiratory rate variability in patients with low organ failure. The further reduction in respiratory variability during the elimination of sedation in patients with high multiple organ dysfunction syndrome suggests a differential response and benefit from sedation interruption, and merits further investigation. As reduced variability correlates with severity of illness, and need for sedation depends on organ failure, variability monitoring may offer a dynamic measure of a variable response to the benefit, timing, and duration of sedation interruption.

N2  - Atrial fibrillation (AF) is one of the most common arrhythmias. The automatic AF  detection is of great clinical significance but at the same time it remains a big problem to researchers. In this study, a novel deep learning method to detect AF was proposed. For a 10 s length single lead electrocardiogram (ECG) signal, the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) was used to obtain the wavelet coefficient matrix, and then a convolutional neural network (CNN) with a specific architecture was trained to discriminate the rhythm of the signal. The ECG data in multiple databases were divided into 4 classes according to the rhythm annotation: normal sinus rhythm (NSR), atrial fibrillation (AF), other types of arrhythmia except AF (OTHER), and noise signal (NOISE). The method was evaluated using three different wavelet bases. The experiment showed promising results when using a Morlet wavelet, with an overall accuracy of 97.56%, an average sensitivity of 97.56%, an average specificity of 99.19%. Besides, the area under curve (AUC) value is 0.9983, which showed that the proposed method was effective for detecting AF.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To propose a wavelet-based template matching technique to extract  features for automatic classification of electrocardiogram signals of normal and arrhythmic individuals. METHODS: The study was conducted from December 2014 to December 2015 at the Department of Electrical Engineering, Institute of Space Technology, Islamabad, Pakistan. Electrocardiogram signals analysed in this study were taken from the freely available database www.physionet.org. The data for normal subjects was taken from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology-Beth Israel Hospital's normal sinus rhythm database and data for diseased subjects was taken from the arrhythmia database. RESULTS: Of the 30 subjects, there were 15(50%) normal and 15(50%) diseased subjects. The group-averaged phase difference indices of arrhythmic subjects were significantly larger than that of normal individuals (p<0.05) within the frequency range of 0.9-1.1 Hz. Moreover, the scatter plot between the phase difference index and magnitude of wavelet cross-spectrum for frequency range of 0.9-1.1 Hz demonstrated a satisfactory delineation between normal and arrhythmic individuals. CONCLUSIONS: Wavelet decomposition-based template matching technique achieved satisfactory delineation of normal and arrhythmic electrocardiogram dynamics.

N2  - In diabetic cardiomyopathy, left ventricular (LV) diastolic dysfunction is one of  the earliest signs of cardiac involvement prior to the definitive development of heart failure (HF). We aimed to explore the LV diastolic function using electrocardiography (ECG)-gated (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ((18)F-FDG PET) imaging beyond the assessment of cardiac glucose utilization in a diabetic rat model. ECG-gated (18)F-FDG PET imaging was performed in a rat model of type 2 diabetes (ZDF fa/fa) and ZL control rats at age of 13 weeks (n = 6, respectively). Under hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp to enhance cardiac activity, (18)F-FDG was administered and subsequently, list-mode imaging using a dedicated small animal PET system with ECG signal recording was performed. List-mode data were sorted and reconstructed into tomographic images of 16 frames per cardiac cycle. Left ventricular functional parameters (systolic: LV ejection fraction (EF), heart rate (HR) vs. diastolic: peak filling rate (PFR)) were obtained using an automatic ventricular edge detection software. No significant difference in systolic function could be obtained (ZL controls vs. ZDF rats: LVEF, 62.5 ± 4.2 vs. 59.4 ± 4.5%; HR: 331 ± 35 vs. 309 ± 24 bpm; n.s., respectively). On the contrary, ECG-gated PET imaging showed a mild but significant decrease of PFR in the diabetic rats (ZL controls vs. ZDF rats: 12.1 ± 0.8 vs. 10.2 ± 1 Enddiastolic Volume/sec, P < 0.01). Investigating a diabetic rat model, ECG-gated (18)F-FDG PET imaging detected LV diastolic dysfunction while systolic function was still preserved. This might open avenues for an early detection of HF onset in high-risk type 2 diabetes before cardiac symptoms become apparent.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The mechanisms whereby aerobic training reduces the occurrence of sudden  cardiac death in humans are not clear. We test the hypothesis that exercise-induced increased resistance to ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation (VT/VF) involve an intrinsic remodeling in healthy hearts. METHODS AND RESULTS: Thirty rats were divided into a sedentary (CTRL, n = 16) and two exercise groups: short- (4 weeks, ST, n = 7) and long-term (8 weeks, LT, n = 7) trained groups. Following the exercise program hearts were isolated and studied in a Langendorff perfusion system. An S1-S2 pacing protocol was applied at the right ventricle to determine inducibility of VT/VF. Fast Fourier transforms were applied on ECG time-series. In-vivo measurements showed training-induced increase in aerobic capacity, heart-to-body weight ratio and a 50% low-to-high frequency ratio reduction in the heart rate variability (p<0.05). In isolated hearts the probability for VF decreased from 26.1±14.4 in CTRL to 13.9±14.1 and 6.7±8.5% in the ST and LT, respectively (p<0.05). Duration of VF also decreased from 19.0±5.7 in CTRL to 8.8±7.1 and 6.0±5.8 sec in ST and LT respectively (p<0.05). Moreover, the pacing current required for VF induction increased following exercise (2.9±1.7 vs. 5.4±2.1 and 8.5±0.9 mA, respectively; p<0.05). Frequency analysis of ECG revealed an exercise-induced VF transition from a narrow single peak spectrum at 17 Hz in CTRL to a broader range of peaks ranging between 8.8 and 22.5 Hz in the LT group (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: Exercise in rats leads to reduced VF propensity associated with an intrinsic cardiac remodeling related to a broader spectral range and faster frequency components in the ECG.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: The authors' primary objective was to test the hypothesis that Cerebral  State Index (CSI)-guided control of anesthetic depth might reduce the consumption of anesthetics and shorten the duration of ICU and hospital stays after surgical correction of combined valve disorders. DESIGN: Single center, randomized trial. SETTING: City Hospital Number 1 of Arkhangelsk, Russian Federation. PARTICIPANTS: Fifty adult patients with combined valve disorders requiring surgical correction. INTERVENTIONS: The patients were randomized into 2 groups. In the CSI group, anesthetic depth was monitored, and the rate of infusion of propofol was titrated to maintain the depth of anesthesia corresponding to a CSI of 40-60. In the control group, the depth of anesthesia was monitored clinically, and the dosage of propofol was administered according to the recommendations of the manufacturer. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: All patients received standard perioperative monitoring. Consumption of anesthetics and length of ICU and hospital stays were recorded. Preoperative patient characteristics did not differ significantly between the groups. In the CSI group, average intraoperative doses of midazolam and propofol were reduced by 41% and 19%, respectively (p<0.01). Maintenance of anesthesia guided by CSI shortened the time until fit for ICU discharge by 50% and reduced the lengths of ICU and postoperative hospital stays by 35% and 25%, respectively (p< 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Monitoring of anesthetic depth reduces the requirements for midazolam and propofol, resulting in a faster recovery and a shorter postoperative ICU and hospital stay after surgical correction of combined valve disorders.

N2  - This work focuses on finding the most discriminatory or representative features that  allow to classify commercials according to negative, neutral and positive effectiveness based on the Ace Score index. For this purpose, an experiment involving forty-seven participants was carried out. In this experiment electroencephalography (EEG), electrocardiography (ECG), Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) and respiration data were acquired while subjects were watching a 30-min audiovisual content. This content was composed by a submarine documentary and nine commercials (one of them the ad under evaluation). After the signal pre-processing, four sets of features were extracted from the physiological signals using different state-of-the-art metrics. These features computed in time and frequency domains are the inputs to several basic and advanced classifiers. An average of 89.76% of the instances was correctly classified according to the Ace Score index. The best results were obtained by a classifier consisting of a combination between AdaBoost and Random Forest with automatic selection of features. The selected features were those extracted from GSR and HRV signals. These results are promising in the audiovisual content evaluation field by means of physiological signal processing.

N2  - Heart rate variability (HRV) is a measure of the beat-to-beat variations in heart  rate. It is usually calculated by analyzing a time series of beat-to-beat intervals from the ECG. Various measures of heart rate variability have been proposed, which can be subdivided into time domain, frequency domain and non-linear measures. HRV is regarded as an indicator of the activity of autonomic regulation of circulatory function. HRV has considerable potential to assess the role of autonomic nervous system fluctuations in normal healthy individuals, in patients with various cardiovascular and noncardiovascular disorders and, in patients undergoing general anesthesia. HRV studies should enhance our understanding of physiological phenomena, perioperative cardiovascular changes, the actions of medications, and disease mechanisms.

N2  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: With the emergence of long-term electrocardiogram (ECG)  recordings that extend several days beyond the typical 24-48 h, the development of new tools to measure heart rate variability (HRV) and QT variability is needed to utilize the full potential of such extra-long-term ECG recordings. METHODS: In this report, we propose a new nonlinear time-frequency analysis approach, the concentration of frequency and time (ConceFT), to study the HRV QT variability from extra-long-term ECG recordings. This approach is a generalization of Short Time Fourier Transform and Continuous Wavelet Transform approaches. RESULTS: As proof of concept, we used 14-day ECG recordings to show that the ConceFT provides a sharpened and stabilized spectrogram by taking the phase information of the time series and the multitaper technique into account. CONCLUSION: The ConceFT has the potential to provide a sharpened and stabilized spectrogram for the heart rate variability and QT variability in 14-day ECG recordings.

N2  - Cardiac and respiratory rhythms are highly nonlinear and nonstationary. As a result  traditional time-domain techniques are often inadequate to characterize their complex dynamics. In this article, we introduce a novel technique to investigate the interactions between R-R intervals and respiratory phases based on their joint symbolic dynamics. To evaluate the technique, electrocardiograms (ECG) and respiratory signals were recorded in 13 healthy subjects in different body postures during spontaneous and controlled breathing. Herein, the R-R time series were extracted from ECG and respiratory phases were obtained from abdomen impedance belts using the Hilbert transform. Both time series were transformed into ternary symbol vectors based on the changes between two successive R-R intervals or respiratory phases. Subsequently, words of different symbol lengths were formed and the correspondence between the two series of words was determined to quantify the interaction between cardiac and respiratory cycles. To validate our results, respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) was further studied using the phase-averaged characterization of the RSA pattern. The percentage of similarity of the sequence of symbols, between the respective words of the two series determined by joint symbolic dynamics, was significantly reduced in the upright position compared to the supine position (26.4 ± 4.7 vs. 20.5 ± 5.4%, p < 0.01). Similarly, RSA was also reduced during upright posture, but the difference was less significant (0.11 ± 0.02 vs. 0.08 ± 0.01 s, p < 0.05). In conclusion, joint symbolic dynamics provides a new efficient technique for the analysis of cardiorespiratory interaction that is highly sensitive to the effects of orthostatic challenge.

N2  - This paper proposes a method for the automatic classification of heartbeats in an  ECG signal. Since this task has specific characteristics such as time dependences between observations and a strong class unbalance, a specific classifier is proposed and evaluated on real ECG signals from the MIT arrhythmia database. This classifier is a weighted variant of the conditional random fields classifier. Experiments show that the proposed method outperforms previously reported heartbeat classification methods, especially for the pathological heartbeats.

N2  - In industrialized countries with aging populations, heart failure affects 0.3-2% of  the general population. The investigation of 24 h-ECG recordings revealed the potential of nonlinear indices of heart rate variability (HRV) for enhanced risk stratification in patients with ischemic heart failure (IHF). However, long-term analyses are time-consuming, expensive, and delay the initial diagnosis. The objective of this study was to investigate whether 30 min short-term HRV analysis is sufficient for comparable risk stratification in IHF in comparison to 24 h-HRV analysis. From 256 IHF patients [221 at low risk (IHFLR) and 35 at high risk (IHFHR)] (a) 24 h beat-to-beat time series (b) the first 30 min segment (c) the 30 min most stationary day segment and (d) the 30 min most stationary night segment were investigated. We calculated linear (time and frequency domain) and nonlinear HRV analysis indices. Optimal parameter sets for risk stratification in IHF were determined for 24 h and for each 30 min segment by applying discriminant analysis on significant clinical and non-clinical indices. Long- and short-term HRV indices from frequency domain and particularly from nonlinear dynamics revealed high univariate significances (p < 0.01) discriminating between IHFLR and IHFHR. For multivariate risk stratification, optimal mixed parameter sets consisting of 5 indices (clinical and nonlinear) achieved 80.4% AUC (area under the curve of receiver operating characteristics) from 24 h HRV analysis, 84.3% AUC from first 30 min, 82.2 % AUC from daytime 30 min and 81.7% AUC from nighttime 30 min. The optimal parameter set obtained from the first 30 min showed nearly the same classification power when compared to the optimal 24 h-parameter set. As results from stationary daytime and nighttime, 30 min segments indicate that short-term analyses of 30 min may provide at least a comparable risk stratification power in IHF in comparison to a 24 h analysis period.

N2  - We present generalizations of our previously published artificial models for  generating multi-channel ECG so that the simulation of abnormal rhythms is possible. Using a three-dimensional vectorcardiogram (VCG) formulation, we generate the normal cardiac dipole for a patient using a sum of Gaussian kernels, fitted to real VCG recordings. Abnormal beats are then specified either as new dipoles, or as perturbations of the existing dipole. Switching between normal and abnormal beat types is achieved using a hidden Markov model (HMM). Probability transitions can be learned from real data or modeled by coupling to heart rate and sympathovagal balance. Natural morphology changes form beat-to-beat are incorporated as before from varying the angular frequency of the dipole as a function of the inter-beat (RR) interval. The RR interval time series is generated using our previously described model whereby time-and frequency-domain heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) characteristics can be specified. QT-HR hysteresis is simulated by coupling the Gaussian kernels associated with the T-wave in the model with a nonlinear factor related to the local HR (determined from the last n RR intervals). Morphology changes due to respiration are simulated by coupling the RR interval to the angular frequency of the dipole. We demonstrate an example of the use of this model by simulating T-Wave Alternans (TWA). The magnitude of the TWA effect is modeled as a disturbance on the T-loop of the dipole with a magnitude that differs in each of the three VCG planes. The effect is then turned on or off using a HMM. The values of the transition matrix are determined by the local heart rate, such that when the HR ramps up towards 100 BPM, the probability of observing a TWA effect rapidly but smoothly increases. In this way, no 'sudden' switching from non-TWA to TWA is observed, and the natural tendency for TWA to be associated with a critical HR-related activation level is simulated. Finally, to generate multi-lead signals, the VCG is mapped to any set of clinical leads using a Dower-like transform derived from a least-squares optimization between known VCGs and known lead morphologies. ECGs with calibrated amounts of TWA were generated by this model and included in the PhysioNet/CinC Challenge 2008 data set.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: We present a method for automatic processing of single-lead  electrocardiogram (ECG) with duration of up to 60 s for the detection of atrial fibrillation (AF). The method categorises an ECG recording into one of four categories: normal, AF, other and noisy rhythm. For training the classification model, 8528 scored ECG signals were used; for independent performance assessment, 3658 scored ECG signals. APPROACH: Our method was based on features derived from RR interbeat intervals. The features included time domain, frequency domain and distribution features. We assessed the performance of three different classifiers (linear and quadratic discriminant analysis, and quadratic neural network (QNN)) on the training set using 100-fold cross-validation. The QNN was selected as the highest performing classifier, and a further performance assessment on the test data made. MAIN RESULTS: On the test set, our method achieved an F1 score for the normal, AF, other and noisy classes of 0.90, 0.75, 0.68 and 0.32, respectively. The overall F1 score was 0.78. SIGNIFICANCE: The computational cost of our algorithm is low as all features are derived from RR intervals and are processed by a single hidden layer neural network. This makes it potentially suitable for low-power devices.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To measure the magnitude of the effect of an individualized  parameterization protocol for hemodynamic alarms in patients with acute myocardial infarction. METHOD: Pragmatic clinical trial, open label and single arm, whose intervention was performed through a protocol validated and tested in 32 patients using multiparametric monitors. The heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation and ST segment-monitoring were measured and classified for clinical consistency one hour before and after the intervention, for 64 hours. RESULTS: The protocol obtained Content Validity Index of 0.92. Of the 460 registered alarms, 261 were considered inconsistent before the intervention and 47 after it. The Relative Risk of inconsistent alarms after the protocol was 0.32 (95% CI 0.23-0.43, p <0.0001). CONCLUSION: The protocol proved to be a protective factor to the appearance of inconsistent clinical alarms of multiparametric monitors.

N2  - The use of spectral techniques to quantify short term heart rate fluctuations on the  order of seconds to minutes has helped define the autonomic contributions to beat-to-beat control of heart rate. We used similar techniques to quantify the entire spectrum (0.00003-1.0 Hz) of heart rate variability during 24 hour ambulatory ECG monitoring. The ECG from standard Holter monitor recordings from normal subjects was sampled with the use of a phase locked loop, and a heart rate time series was constructed at 3 Hz. Frequency analysis of the heart rate signal was performed after a nonlinear filtering algorithm was used to eliminate artifacts. A power spectrum of the entire 24 hour record revealed power that was inversely proportional to frequency, 1/f, over 4 decades from 0.00003 to 0.1 Hz (period approximately 10 hours to 10 seconds). Displaying consecutive spectra calculated at 5 minute intervals revealed marked variability in the peaks at all frequencies throughout the 24 hours, probably accounting for the lack of distinct peaks in the spectra of the entire records.

N2  - The analysis of heart rate variability (HRV) is a powerful tool in the study of the  autonomic control of the heart. While circadian HRV rhythms have widely been characterized by traditional spectral measures, ultradian oscillations are not commonly investigated. In this study the identification of HRV ultradian rhythms is assigned to a quantitative measure characterizing the fractal-like behavior of the time series: the fractal dimension (FD). In order to assess ultradian regulation in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) 24-h Holter ECG recordings of 52 COPD and 10 normal (healthy) subjects were analyzed. The FD was calculated by Higuchi's algorithm both during daytime and nighttime to highlight possible wake-sleep states differences. All subjects showed a similar common rhythm (0.06mHz) that persists with generally higher amplitude during night-time. A further rhythm becomes predominant in normal subjects in the day-to-night transition (0.15mHz), probably under the influence of the REM/non-REM ultradian sleep cycle. A very large difference between night and day amplitudes of this rhythm and of the next one (at about 0.22mHz) characterize the HRV fractal dimension of the Normal in respect of COPD. In conclusion, the FD could be used as a marker of ultradian cardiac autonomic regulation providing new insights into autonomic physiology of normal and COPD patients.

N2  - The presence of respiratory information within the electrocardiogram (ECG) signal is  a well-documented phenomenon. We present a Gaussian process framework for the estimation of respiratory rate from the different sources of modulation in a single-lead ECG. We propose a periodic covariance function to model the frequency- and amplitude-modulation time series derived from the ECG, where the hyperparameters of the process are used to derive the respiratory rate. The approach is evaluated using data taken from 40 healthy subjects each with 2 hours of monitoring, containing ECG and respiration waveforms. Results indicate that the accuracy of our proposed method is comparable with that of existing methods, but with the advantages of a principled probabilistic approach, including the direct quantification of the uncertainty in the estimation.

N2  - An automatic configuration that can detect the position of R-waves, classify the  normal sinus rhythm (NSR) and other four arrhythmic types from the continuous ECG signals obtained from the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database is proposed. In this configuration, a support vector machine (SVM) was used to detect and mark the ECG heartbeats with raw signals and differential signals of a lead ECG. An algorithm based on the extracted markers segments waveforms of Lead II and V1 of the ECG as the pattern classification features. A self-constructing neural fuzzy inference network (SoNFIN) was used to classify NSR and four arrhythmia types, including premature ventricular contraction (PVC), premature atrium contraction (PAC), left bundle branch block (LBBB), and right bundle branch block (RBBB). In a real scenario, the classification results show the accuracy achieved is 96.4%. This performance is suitable for a portable ECG monitor system for home care purposes.

A second aim was the functional assessment of cardiovascular parameters, including heart rate variability (HRV) and blood pressure variability (BPV), so that these data could be used as the basis for the objective evaluation of autonomic activity and balance in different behavioural contexts. Eleven domestic pigs (German Landrace) underwent surgery for the placement of a telemetric device. At day 15 after surgery, 512 consecutive inter-beat intervals and pressure waves were analysed using different detection methods (automatic and manually corrected) while the animals were resting or feeding, respectively. HRV and BPV were calculated. Incomplete datasets were found in four pigs due to missing ECG or BP signals. Technical and surgical issues concerning catheterisation and detachment of the negative ECG lead were continuously improved. In the remaining pigs, excellent signal quality (manually corrected data of 1%) was obtained during resting and acceptable signal quality (<10%) was obtained during feeding. Automatic triggering was sufficiently reliable to eliminate errors in BP recordings during active behaviour, but this was not the case for ECG recordings. Sympathetic arousal with accompanying vagal withdrawal during feeding was documented. The established surgical implantation and functional assessment of the telemetric system with the reliable registration of cardiovascular parameters in freely moving pigs could serve as a basis for future studies of autonomic regulation in context of stress and animal welfare.

N2  - RATIONALE: Functional reinnervation of the transplanted human heart by the autonomic  nervous system has not been demonstrated. A lack of autonomic control of the transplanted allograft is reflected by an increased resting heart rate, a sluggish heart rate response to dynamical exercise and a reduced heart rate variability. Recent evidence suggests that a measure of deterministic chaos in the heartbeat interval series (point correlation dimension, PD2i) is superior to the conventional power spectrum or other stochastic measures in detecting changes in the mechanism underlying heartbeat generation. METHODS: The PD2i is based on the presumption that the variability is determined and patterned, whereas the stochastic measures all assume that the variability is around a stationary mean and is noise. The PD2i reconstructs the degrees of freedom (number of independent variables) in the system that generates the time series examined, and does this irrespective of whether the system is stochastic or deterministic and is stationary in time. RESULTS: PD2i was determined for heartbeat intervals (RR, ECG digitized at 1200 Hz; supine posture) of 23 heart transplant recipients (HTR: 9 adults, 14 children; 0.04-7.7 years after transplantation) and 21 healthy control subjects (CTL; 13 adults, 8 children). The PD2i (+/-SD) averaged 5.4 +/- 0.7 for the CTL adults and 5.4 +/- 0.6 for the CTL children. Mean PD2i was reduced after transplantation to 1.1 +/- 0.1 in 6 HTRs recorded within 1 year after surgery; in one HTR recorded 2 weeks after surgery the mean PD2i was 3.7. Between 1 to 2 years PD2i was found increased in 2 of 3 subjects and between 2 to 8 years it was increased in 13 of 13, but not to control levels. In normal hearts the QT subinterval of each heartbeat cycle is associated with inotropy and the RR-QT remainder with chronotropy (i.e., the dyastolic interval during which RR is primarily regulated). To examine more closely the residual and returning heartbeat dynamics of the HTR subjects, these subinterval series were examined during mild exercise (40 to 90 Watts) and its recovery. In recent HTRs, resting QT and RR-QT were moderately reduced and modulated by exercise and recovery, but with an approximate 100 beat latency. In long-term (7-8 years) HTR subjects there was a rapid and larger response to exercise/recovery, but compared to normal the range was smaller and the complexity of the subinterval trajectories in time was simpler. CONCLUSIONS: Recurrence of low-dimensional deterministic dynamics after transplantation suggests recovery of neurocardiac control attributable to 1) reorganization of the viable intrinsic cardiac nervous system, 2) reinnervation by the extrinsic autonomic nervous system, or 3) both.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: The electrocardiogram (ECG) provides an effective, non-invasive approach  for clinical diagnosis in patients with cardiac diseases such as atrial fibrillation (AF). AF is the most common cardiac rhythm disturbance and affects ~2% of the general population in industrialized countries. Automatic AF detection in clinics remains a challenging task due to the high inter-patient variability of ECGs, and unsatisfactory existing approaches for AF diagnosis (e.g. atrial or ventricular activity-based analyses). APPROACH: We have developed RhythmNet, a 21-layer 1D convolutional recurrent neural network, trained using 8528 single-lead ECG recordings from the 2017 PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology (CinC) Challenge, to classify ECGs of different rhythms including AF automatically. Our RhythmNet architecture contained 16 convolutions to extract features directly from raw ECG waveforms, followed by three recurrent layers to process ECGs of varying lengths and to detect arrhythmia events in long recordings. Large 15  ×  1 convolutional filters were used to effectively learn the detailed variations of the signal within small time-frames such as the P-waves and QRS complexes. We employed residual connections throughout RhythmNet, along with batch-normalization and rectified linear activation units to improve convergence during training. MAIN RESULTS: We evaluated our algorithm on 3658 testing data and obtained an F (1) accuracy of 82% for classifying sinus rhythm, AF, and other arrhythmias. RhythmNet was also ranked 5th in the 2017 CinC Challenge. SIGNIFICANCE: Potentially, our approach could aid AF diagnosis in clinics and be used for patient self-monitoring to improve the early detection and effective treatment of AF.

N2  - Fundamental understanding of higher cognitive functions can greatly benefit from  imaging of cortical activity with high spatiotemporal resolution in the behaving non-human primate. To achieve rapid imaging of high-resolution dynamics of cortical representations of spontaneous and evoked activity, we designed a novel data acquisition protocol for sensory stimulation by rapidly interleaving multiple stimuli in continuous sessions of optical imaging with voltage-sensitive dyes. We also tested a new algorithm for the "temporally structured component analysis" (TSCA) of a multidimensional time series that was developed for our new data acquisition protocol, but was tested only on simulated data (Blumenfeld, 2010). In addition to the raw data, the algorithm incorporates prior knowledge about the temporal structure of the data as well as input from other information. Here we showed that TSCA can successfully separate functional signal components from other signals referred to as noise. Imaging of responses to multiple visual stimuli, utilizing voltage-sensitive dyes, was performed on the visual cortex of awake monkeys. Multiple cortical representations, including orientation and ocular dominance maps as well as the hitherto elusive retinotopic representation of orientation stimuli, were extracted in only 10s of imaging, approximately two orders of magnitude faster than accomplished by conventional methods. Since the approach is rather general, other imaging techniques may also benefit from the same stimulation protocol. This methodology can thus facilitate rapid optical imaging explorations in monkeys, rodents and other species with a versatility and speed that were not feasible before.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Accurate measurement of QRS complex duration (QRSd) remains crucial for  the selection of patients for cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). However, assessment of QRSd on conventional surface electrocardiograms (ECG), especially when performed without computer assistance, may be challenging due to the limited accuracy of the human eye to discriminate differences in the range of 10 ms at 25 mm/s. The value and reproducibility of visual assessment of QRSd at 25 mm/s on conventional ECGs was compared to those obtained using an electrophysiology recording system (EPRS) with simultaneous 12 lead traces at 100 mm/s, which was considered the gold standard. METHODS: The ECGs of 102 consecutive patients with left ventricular dysfunction undergoing electrophysiological evaluation were collected. Two sets of measurements were obtained: 1) QRSd-25 measured on conventional 12-lead ECGs printed at 25 mm/s with standard amplification (10 mm/mV) by 4 different observers, and 2) QRSd-100 measured on simultaneous 12-lead traces at 100 mm/s and 40 mm/mV by 2 different observers using electronic callipers. RESULTS: Significant differences were observed between QRSd-100 and QRSd-25 measurements (19.3 ± 9.9 ms, range 1.0-47.5, p < 0.001). QRSd-25 showed significant inter and intra-observer variability. When categorizing individual ECGs in three QRSd-25 subgroups (<120 ms, 120-149 ms and ≥150 ms), low concordance was observed between both techniques (kappa index 0.25, p < 0.001). The sensitivity and specificity of QRSd-25 to detect QRSd-100 ≥ 150 ms was 36.6% and 100.0% respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Visual measurement of QRSd at 25 mm/s often underestimates its magnitude and presents significant inter and intraobserver variability.

N2  - Haemodynamic responses during parabolic flight were studied. The hypothesis that  haemodynamic changes may be counteracted by a transient vagal reflex during acute gravity transitions was tested. ECG, arterial pressure and respiration were recorded continuously in seven male subjects during parabolic flight. Beat-to-beat haemodynamic parameters were estimated. In the supine position no significant differences were shown among the different gravity phases. In the upright position, significant within-group differences were observed across gravity phases for all parameters. Postural differences in haemodynamic data disappeared during the microgravity phase and were enlarged during hypergravity phases. Detailed temporal analysis of cardiac time series in standing subjects confirmed the hypothesized biphasic response of initial parasympathetic modulation: a sharp increase of RRI within 3-5 s followed by a 10% decrease in the remaining period of microgravity (p < 0.001); a sharp increase in SAP within 2-4 s followed by a slow decrease of 25%. Significant within-group differences were observed in the standing position for mean RRI (836 ± 170 ms, p = 0.003), DAP (66 ± 8 mmHg, p < 0.001), MAP (139 ± 12 mmHg, p = 0.001), RRI HF amplitude (17.6 ± 7.5 ms, p < 0.001), SV (146 ± 5%, p < 0.001) and SVR (73 ± 10%, p = 0.020). In standing subjects, the initial baroreflex-mediated vagal heart rate response is limited to a transition period at early microgravity lasting about 3-5 s, followed by a gradual heart rate recovery during the remaining 15-17 s due to a parasympathetic withdrawal. The resultant increase in cardiac output induces a baroreflex-mediated systemic vasodilatation, which may be the driving force for a decreased arterial pressure in weightlessness.

N2  - This crossover observational study compares the data characteristics and performance  of new-generation Nellcor OXIMAX and Masimo SET SmartPod pulse oximeter technologies. The study was conducted independent of either original equipment manufacturer (OEM) across eleven preterm infants in a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU). The SmartPods were integrated with Dräger Infinity Delta monitors. The Delta monitor measured the heart rate (HR) using an independent electrocardiogram sensor, and the two SmartPods collected arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2) and pulse rate (PR). All patient data were non-Gaussian. Nellcor PR showed a higher correlation with the HR as compared to Masimo PR. The statistically significant difference found in their median values (1% for SpO2, 1 bpm for PR) was deemed clinically insignificant. SpO2 alarms generated by both SmartPods were observed and categorized for performance evaluation. Results for sensitivity, positive predictive value, accuracy and false alarm rates were Nellcor (80.3, 50, 44.5, 50%) and Masimo (72.2, 48.2, 40.6, 51.8%) respectively. These metrics were not statistically significantly different between the two pulse oximeters. Despite claims by OEMs, both pulse oximeters exhibited high false alarm rates, with no statistically or clinically significant difference in performance. These findings have a direct impact on alarm fatigue in the NICU. Performance evaluation studies can also impact medical device purchase decisions made by hospital administrators.

N2  - BACKGROUND: During atrial fibrillation (AF) irregularity of RR intervals may modify  QT/RR relation differently from sinus rhythm. The purpose of this study was to compare QT/RR relation based on a single-beat analysis using the first preceding RR interval with the modified RR interval reflecting not only the first preceding but also the second and further preceding RR intervals during AF. METHODS: QT and RR intervals were measured using an automatic QT analyzing system in 32 patients who had both AF and sinus rhythm on the same 24-h Holter ECG recording. In 12 patients antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) were administered. To reflect irregularity of the preceding RR intervals during AF, a modified RR (mRR) using a weighted average of five successive RR intervals: (5RR(1)+2RR(2)+RR(3)+RR(4)+RR(5))/10 was adopted. Linear regression analyses between QT and RR intervals were performed using the preceding RR(1) (QT/RR) and the modified RR (QT/mRR) during AF. RESULTS: During AF the slope of QT/RR was lower than that of QT/mRR and was also lower than that of QT/RR during sinus rhythm in patients with and without AAD. Slopes of regression line in QT/RR during sinus rhythm, QT/RR and QT/mRR during AF were steeper in patients with AAD than those in patients without. Slopes of QT/RR during sinus rhythm correlated with those of QT/mRR (r=0.79, p<0.01) better than those of QT/RR (r=0.64, p<0.05) during AF. QT interval at an RR interval of 1.20s or 1.00 s obtained from QT/RR during AF was significantly smaller than that during sinus rhythm in patients with and without AAD. CONCLUSIONS: The slope of QT/mRR during AF became closer to that of QT/RR during sinus rhythm compared with that of QT/RR during AF. QT interval during sinus rhythm could be estimated better using QT/mRR than using QT/RR during AF.

N2  - The aim of this paper is to present the project of telecardiology within the ASP of  Cosenza, one of the largest provinces of Italy characterized by a particular orography, with difficult and inaccessible roads. The goal of this project is to manage the emergency more efficiently by reducing the time of intervention by bringing the patient not to the nearest hospital, but more importantly to the hospital more appropriately suited to better manage the cardiological emergency. This system also uses the most modern web-based interface technology protected by login and password. The project also provides the integration, supply and installation of advanced and modern central by ensuring efficient screening is carried out using monitors in all the coronary care units of the ASP of Cosenza, networking with electrocardiography of all the point of first medical contact and all the 118 emergency rescue service. By integrating all these procedures and information and making them available to any point in the hospital and territorial network, this project becomes not only a more efficient system for managing cardiac emergency but also a pathway that will guarantee increased care of patients from the onset of symptoms to discharge.

N2  - BACKGROUND: As cardiovascular diseases have become the leading cause of death in  many countries including China, nurses are increasingly required to be abreast of technological advances and the skills necessary to manage this increasing health care problem. Chinese nurses are under pressure to provide skilled electrocardiography monitoring, and be sufficiently skilled to detect myocardial ischemia and infarction, in this large patient population. This presents a challenge for the nursing profession in China, particularly for nurses working in coronary care in a country where advancement has been so rapid, yet little research has been conducted or reported in the literature. OBJECTIVES: The two main objectives were: to explore the demographic and educational factors that affect the use of ST-segment monitoring and correct electrode placement by CCU/ICU nurses in China; and to explore the factors both individual and institutional that affect monitoring and lead placement. METHODS: A self-administered questionnaire was distributed to nurses in 126 randomly selected tertiary hospitals, which were stratified into three homogeneous regions across China. The instrument examined demographics, information about hospitals, electrocardiogram devices, current practice patterns and perceptions toward monitoring and lead placement. Data from 734 nurses and 59 nurse managers from 59 hospitals were analyzed using t-tests, ANOVA, Chi-square test and logistic regression. RESULTS: Electrocardiogram monitoring was used to detect myocardial ischemia by 43.7% of respondents, and 35.1% selected leads according to electrocardiogram or angiography findings. Most (70%) agreed that monitoring for acute coronary syndrome was important, while 39.2% did so, and 15.7% were able to identify correct placement. Logistic regression revealed a significant relationship between the uses of ST-segment monitoring and number of hospital beds, continuing education and a belief in its use and ease of use. Correct electrode placement was significantly correlated with respondents from university hospitals, hospitals with more acute coronary syndrome admissions and more independent thinking nurses. CONCLUSIONS: Despite best practice evidence, less than half of the sample used electrocardiogram monitoring to detect myocardial ischemia and the majority could not identify correct electrode placement, while ST-segment monitoring was not used routinely. This paper highlights the need for improvements in education both in universities and hospitals and discussion addresses conventions in units, which inhibit development of nurses' skills.

N2  - Goal-directed therapy (GDT) encompasses guidance of intravenous (IV) fluid and  vasopressor/inotropic therapy by cardiac output or similar parameters to help in early recognition and management of high-risk cardiac surgical patients. With the aim of establishing the utility of perioperative GDT using robust clinical and biochemical outcomes, we conducted the present study. This multicenter randomized controlled study included 130 patients of either sex, with European system for cardiac operative risk evaluation ≥3 undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting on cardiopulmonary bypass. The patients were randomly divided into the control and GDT group. All the participants received standardized care; arterial pressure monitored through radial artery, central venous pressure (CVP) through a triple lumen in the right internal jugular vein, electrocardiogram, oxygen saturation, temperature, urine output per hour, and frequent arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis. In addition, cardiac index (CI) monitoring using FloTrac™ and continuous central venous oxygen saturation (ScVO2) using PreSep™ were used in patients in the GDT group. Our aim was to maintain the CI at 2.5-4.2 L/min/m2, stroke volume index 30-65 ml/beat/m2, systemic vascular resistance index 1500-2500 dynes/s/cm5/m2, oxygen delivery index 450-600 ml/min/m2, continuous ScVO2 >70%, and stroke volume variation <10%; in addition to the control group parameters such as CVP 6-8 mmHg, mean arterial pressure 90-105 mmHg, normal ABG values, oxygen saturation, hematocrit value >30%, and urine output >1 ml/kg/h. The aims were achieved by altering the administration of IV fluids and doses of inotropes or vasodilators. The data of sixty patients in each group were analyzed in view of ten exclusions. The average duration of ventilation (19.89 ± 3.96 vs. 18.05 ± 4.53 h, P = 0.025), hospital stay (7.94 ± 1.64 vs. 7.17 ± 1.93 days, P = 0.025), and Intensive Care Unit (ICU) stay (3.74 ± 0.59 vs. 3.41 ± 0.75 days, P = 0.012) was significantly less in the GDT group, compared to the control group. The extra volume added and the number of inotropic dose adjustments were significantly more in the GDT group. The two groups did not differ in duration of inotropic use, mortality, and other complications. The perioperative continuation of GDT affected the early decline in the lactate levels after 6 h in ICU, whereas the control group demonstrated a settling lactate only after 12 h. Similarly, the GDT group had significantly lower levels of brain natriuretic peptide, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin levels as compared to the control. The study clearly depicts the advantage of GDT for a favorable postoperative outcome in high-risk cardiac surgical patients.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Haloperidol is the most frequently prescribed antipsychotic for delirium  symptoms. The risk of QTc prolongation often raises concerns, although the effect of haloperidol on QTc interval has not yet been investigated in a randomised placebo-controlled fixed-dose study. METHODS: A subanalysis of a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled study was conducted to evaluate the effect of prophylactic haloperidol 1 mg or placebo 1 mg orally twice-daily (maximum of 14 doses) on QTc interval in patients aged 70 years and over. Bedside, 12-lead ECGs were recorded before, during and after the one-week intervention period. Automatic QTc measurements were obtained in addition to manual measurements of QT and RR intervals, blinded for treatment status. Manual measurements were corrected (QTc) using Bazett (QTc-B), Framingham (QTc-Fa), Fridericia (QTc-Fi) and Hodges (QTc-H) methods. Mixed model analyses were used to test for differences in longitudinal course of QTc between patients receiving haloperidol and placebo. RESULTS: ECG recordings of 72 patients (haloperidol n = 38) were analysed, 45.8% male. Median (range) haloperidol serum concentration on day 4 was 0.71 (0.32-1.82) µg/L (n = 23). Longitudinal course of mean QTc did not significantly differ between treatment arms for any of the automatic or manually derived QTc values. CONCLUSIONS: Low dose oral haloperidol did not result in QTc prolongation in older acutely hospitalised patients. Results may not be generalizable to patients with existing ECG abnormalities such as atrial fibrillation.

N2  - Over recent years, Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) has gained popularity as an  effective means to denoise biologically sourced single channel signals, especially Electromyogram (EMG) and Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals amongst others. There are numerous applications whereby the signal acquisition process results in the mixing of both types of signals along with body motion artifacts and the inevitable electromagnetic interference. Both ECG and EMG signals are very useful to physicians, though preferably in isolation, though they rarely present themselves in this manner. Simple filtering techniques are ineffective in their separation as both signal spectra overlap in the frequency domain. In this paper, we propose a technique based on a sliding SSA algorithm which proves to be more successful in separating real mixed EMG and ECG signals than traditional block based approaches on single channel data. SSA is a non-parametric technique that decomposes the original time series into a number of additive components, each of which can then be readily identified based on statistical analysis as belonging to EMG or ECG signals. This approach could be applied equally to other signal types using different statistical methods as required, moreover, this technique is relatively straight-forward to implement and does not require any reference signals or training.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Sudden cardiac arrest continues to be the leading cause of death in  the industrialized world. SOURCES OF DATA: Original papers, reviews and guidelines. AREAS OF AGREEMENT: Community programs for lay bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and automatic external defibrillation improve outcomes. Post-arrest care, including targeted temperature management (TTM) combined with early coronary angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention, is helpful for those suffering cardiac arrest during an ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. AREAS OF CONTROVERSY: (1) The optimal approach to encourage lay bystanders to assist with resuscitation efforts. (2) Whether TTM combined with early coronary angiography is cost effective for those without ST elevation on their post-arrest ECG is unknown. GROWING POINTS: Increasing data show that chest compression-only CPR is preferred by lay rescuers and improves local survival rates. AREAS TIMELY FOR DEVELOPING RESEARCH: Randomized clinical trials are underway to examine the utility of early coronary angiography in the treatment of post-arrest patients without ST-segment elevation.

N2  - This article presents a new deep learning approach for cardiac arrhythmia (17  classes) detection based on long-duration electrocardiography (ECG) signal analysis. Cardiovascular disease prevention is one of the most important tasks of any health care system as about 50 million people are at risk of heart disease in the world. Although automatic analysis of ECG signal is very popular, current methods are not satisfactory. The goal of our research was to design a new method based on deep learning to efficiently and quickly classify cardiac arrhythmias. Described research are based on 1000 ECG signal fragments from the MIT - BIH Arrhythmia database for one lead (MLII) from 45 persons. Approach based on the analysis of 10-s ECG signal fragments (not a single QRS complex) is applied (on average, 13 times less classifications/analysis). A complete end-to-end structure was designed instead of the hand-crafted feature extraction and selection used in traditional methods. Our main contribution is to design a new 1D-Convolutional Neural Network model (1D-CNN). The proposed method is 1) efficient, 2) fast (real-time classification) 3) non-complex and 4) simple to use (combined feature extraction and selection, and classification in one stage). Deep 1D-CNN achieved a recognition overall accuracy of 17 cardiac arrhythmia disorders (classes) at a level of 91.33% and classification time per single sample of 0.015 s. Compared to the current research, our results are one of the best results to date, and our solution can be implemented in mobile devices and cloud computing.

N2  - Electrocardiogram (ECG) is the electrical activity of the heart indicated by P,  Q-R-S and T wave. The minute changes in the amplitude and duration of ECG depicts a particular type of cardiac abnormality. It is very difficult to decipher the hidden information present in this nonlinear and nonstationary signal. An automatic diagnostic system that characterizes cardiac activities in ECG signals would provide more insight into these phenomena thereby revealing important clinical information. Various methods have been proposed to detect cardiac abnormalities in ECG recordings. Application of higher order spectra (HOS) features is a seemingly promising approach because it can capture the nonlinear and dynamic nature of the ECG signals. In this paper, we have automatically classified five types of beats using HOS features (higher order cumulants) using two different approaches. The five types of ECG beats are normal (N), right bundle branch block (RBBB), left bundle branch block (LBBB), atrial premature contraction (APC) and ventricular premature contraction (VPC). In the first approach, cumulant features of segmented ECG signal were used for classification; whereas in the second approach cumulants of discrete wavelet transform (DWT) coefficients were used as features for classifiers. In both approaches, the cumulant features were subjected to data reduction using principal component analysis (PCA) and classified using three layer feed-forward neural network (NN) and least square-support vector machine (LS-SVM) classifiers. In this study, we obtained the highest average accuracy of 94.52%, sensitivity of 98.61% and specificity of 98.41% using first approach with NN classifier. The developed system is ready clinically to run on large datasets.

N2  - The aim of this paper was to study the effect of spontaneous arousals during  night-time sleep on the interactions between R-R intervals and respiratory phases in healthy children. We collected overnight polysomnography data of 40 healthy children and investigated cardio-respiratory interaction before and after spontaneous arousals during stage 2 sleep using joint symbolic dynamics. The R-R time series were extracted from electrocardiograms (ECG) and respiratory phases were obtained from abdominal sensors using the Hilbert transform. Both the series were transformed into ternary symbol vectors based on the changes between two successive R-R intervals or respiratory phases, respectively. Subsequently, words of length '2' were formed and the correspondence between words of the two series was determined to quantify cardio-respiratory interaction for pre- and post-spontaneous arousal episodes. We observed a brief but significant shortening in R-R and respiratory intervals after arousal. There was also a significant short-term increase in cardio-respiratory interaction during the first 30-second post-arousal episode as compared to 30-second pre-arousal episode (7.5±3.4 vs. 5.2±3.7%, p&#60;0.0001, respectively). In conclusion, spontaneous arousals in healthy children during night-time sleep are associated with a temporal but significant increase in cardio-respiratory interaction.

N2  - Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is a rare malignant  arrhythmia, usually diagnosed in the adolescent years. The diagnosis can typically be made by one or more of the following: a positive family history, exercise electrocardiography, ambulatory ECG monitoring and/or an intra-cardiac, electrophysiological examination. This is a case report of a patient with CPVT that was refractory to treatment with beta-blockade and an implanted automatic cardioverter defibrillator. However, after a selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor (SSRI) was added to the therapeutic regimen, no further episodes of ventricular tachycardia occurred during the following two years.

N2  - AIMS: This study used entropy- and cross entropy-based methods to explore the  cardiorespiratory coupling of depressive patients, and thus to assess the values of those entropy methods for identifying depression patients with different disease severities. METHODS: Electrocardiogram (ECG) and respiration signals from 69 depression patients were recorded simultaneously for 5 min. Patients were classified into three groups according to the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) scores: group Non-De (HDRS 0-7), Mid-De (HDRS 8-17), and Con-De (HDRS >17). Sample entropy (SEn), fuzzy measure entropy (FMEn) and high-frequency power (HF) were computed on the original RR interval time series and breath-to-breath interval time series. Cross sample entropy (CSEn) and cross fuzzy measure entropy (CFMEn) were computed on interval time series resampled at 2 Hz and 4 Hz, respectively. The difference among three patient groups and correlation between entropy values and HDRS scores were analyzed by statistical analysis. Surrogate data were also employed to confirm the validation of entropy measures in this study. RESULTS: A consistent increasing trend has been found among most entropy measures from Non-De, to Mid-De, and to Con-De groups, and a significant (p < 0.05) difference in FMEn of RR intervals exists between Non-De and Mid-De or Con-De groups. Significant differences have been also found in all cross entropies, between Non-De and Con-De groups and between Mid-De and Con-De groups. Furthermore, significant correlations also exist between HDRS scores and FMEn of RR intervals (R = 0.24, p < 0.05), CSEn at 4 Hz (R = 0.26, p < 0.05) or 2 Hz (R = 0.28, p < 0.05) resampling, and CFMEn at 4 Hz (R = 0.31, p < 0.01) or 2 Hz (R = 0.30, p < 0.05) resampling. A significant difference of cardiorespiratory coupling parameters between different depression stages and significant correlations between entropy measures and depression severity both indicate central autonomic dysregulation in depression patients and reflect varying degrees of vagal modulation reduction among different depression levels. Analysis based on surrogate data confirms that the non-linear properties of the physiological signals played a major role in depression recognition. CONCLUSION: The current study demonstrates the potential of cardiorespiratory coupling in the auxiliary diagnosis of depression based on the entropy method.

N2  - Computer systems for Electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis support the clinician in  tedious tasks (e.g., Holter ECG monitored in Intensive Care Units) or in prompt detection of dangerous events (e.g., ventricular fibrillation). Together with clinical applications (arrhythmia detection and heart rate variability analysis), ECG is currently being investigated in biometrics (human identification), an emerging area receiving increasing attention. Methodologies for clinical applications can have both differences and similarities with respect to biometrics. This paper reviews methods of ECG processing from a pattern recognition perspective. In particular, we focus on features commonly used for heartbeat classification. Considering the vast literature in the field and the limited space of this review, we dedicated a detailed discussion only to a few classifiers (Artificial Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines) because of their popularity; however, other techniques such as Hidden Markov Models and Kalman Filtering will be also mentioned.

N2  - With age, our blood vessels are prone to aging, which induces cardiovascular  disease. As an important basis for diagnosing heart disease and evaluating heart function, the electrocardiogram (ECG) records cardiac physiological electrical activity. Abnormalities in cardiac physiological activity are directly reflected in the ECG. Thus, ECG research is conducive to heart disease diagnosis. Considering the complexity of arrhythmia detection, we present an improved convolutional neural network (CNN) model for accurate classification. Compared with the traditional machine learning methods, CNN requires no additional feature extraction steps due to the automatic feature processing layers. In this paper, an improved CNN is proposed to automatically classify the heartbeat of arrhythmia. Firstly, all the heartbeats are divided from the original signals. After segmentation, the ECG heartbeats can be inputted into the first convolutional layers. In the proposed structure, kernels with different sizes are used in each convolution layer, which takes full advantage of the features in different scales. Then a max-pooling layer followed. The outputs of the last pooling layer are merged and as the input to fully-connected layers. Our experiment is in accordance with the AAMI inter-patient standard, which included normal beats (N), supraventricular ectopic beats (S), ventricular ectopic beats (V), fusion beats (F), and unknown beats (Q). For verification, the MIT arrhythmia database is introduced to confirm the accuracy of the proposed method, then, comparative experiments are conducted. The experiment demonstrates that our proposed method has high performance for arrhythmia detection, the accuracy is 99.06%. When properly trained, the proposed improved CNN model can be employed as a tool to automatically detect different kinds of arrhythmia from ECG.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is critically associated with  cardiovascular mortality and morbidity, especially in patients with heart failure (HF). However, the majority of SDB patients remain undiagnosed. In contrast, abnormality in heart rate variability has been reported in patients with SDB. To explore an efficient electrocardiogram (ECG)-based screening tool for SDB, we examined the usefulness of cyclic variation in heart rate score (CVHRS) by Holter ECG in subjects with HF. METHODS: In this study, 102 subjects with HF were enrolled. We simultaneously performed Holter ECG with overnight portable sleep monitoring, and we measured the respiratory disturbance index (RDI) and CVHRS. We determined the temporal position of the individual dips comprising the CVHRS using time-domain methods. CVHRS was measured as cyclic and autocorrelated dips in smoothed interbeat interval time series. RESULTS: There were 25 subjects with severe SDB (RDI ≥ 30 events/h) and 77 subjects with none-to-moderate SDB (0 ≤ RDI < 30 events/h). There was a significant positive correlation between CVHRS and RDI (r = 0.60, P < .001). In receiver operating characteristic analysis, CVHRS (cutoff of 30 events/h) identified severe SDB with a sensitivity of 82%, a specificity of 77%, and an area under the curve of 0.83. CONCLUSIONS: CVHRS determined by Holter ECG is a useful screening index for severe SDB in subjects with HF.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Prolonged Tpeak-end (the interval from the peak of the T wave to the end  of the T wave) and Tpeak-end/QT ratio have been shown to be markers of arrhythmogenesis in various cardiac disorders. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the utility of Tpeak-end and Tpeak-end/QT ratio at admission in patients with acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) in predicting malignant ventricular arrhythmias. METHODS: The study group included 50 patients presenting with STEMI, in whom Tpeak-end and Tpeak-end/QT ratio were measured at admission; these patients were monitored for arrhythmias with a continuous electrocardiogram in the intensive care unit for 48 hours, and 50 healthy individuals acted as controls. RESULTS: The Tpeak-end (0.11 ± 0.04 seconds vs 0.08 ± 0.006 seconds; P < .0010) and Tpeak-end/QT ratio (0.30 ± 0.06 vs 0.21 ± 0.02; P < .001) were prolonged in patients with STEMI. Three patients with STEMI who sustained ventricular fibrillation (VF) within 24 hours of admission had prolonged corrected QT interval (0.39 ± 0.04 seconds vs 0.46 ± 0.13 seconds; P = .019), Tpeak-end (0.10 ± 0.02 seconds vs 0.20 ± 0.11 seconds; P < .001), and Tpeak-end/QT ratio (0.26 ± 0.05 vs 0.41 ± 0.09; P < .001) as compared with patients with STEMI without VF. Tpeak-end > 0.1 seconds and Tpeak-end/QT ratio > 0.3 predicted VF with a sensitivity of 100%. However, the Tpeak-end/QT ratio had a higher specificity (82.9% for Tpeak-end/QT ratio vs 44.7% for Tpeak-end) and accuracy (84% for Tpeak-end/QT ratio vs 48% for Tpeak-end). CONCLUSION: Tpeak-end and Tpeak-end/QT ratio are prolonged in patients with STEMI compared with healthy individuals, and Tpeak-end > 0.1 and Tpeak-end/QT ratio > 0.3 predict malignant ventricular arrhythmias within 24 hours of STEMI.

N2  - Atrial fibrillation (A-fib) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia. To effectively  treat or prevent A-fib, automatic A-fib detection based on Electrocardiograph (ECG) monitoring is highly desirable. This paper reviews recently developed techniques for A-fib detection based on non-episodic surface ECG monitoring data. A-fib detection methods in the literature can be mainly classified into three categories: (1) time domain methods; (2) frequency domain methods; and (3) non-linear methods. In general the performances of these methods were evaluated in terms of sensitivity, specificity and overall detection accuracy on the datasets from the Physionet repository. Based on our survey, we conclude that no promising A-fib detection method that performs consistently well across various scenarios has been proposed yet.

N2  - Survival after in-hospital cardiac arrest (I-HCA) remains < 30 %. There is very  limited literature exploring the electrocardiogram changes prior to I-HCA. The purpose of the study was to determine demographics and electrocardiographic predictors prior to I-HCA. A retrospective study was conducted among 39 cardiovascular subjects who had cardiopulmonary resuscitation from I-HCA with initial rhythms of pulseless electrical activity (PEA) and asystole. Demographics including medical history, ejection fraction, laboratory values, and medications were examined. Electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters from telemetry were studied to identify changes in heart rate, QRS duration and morphology, and time of occurrence and location of ST segment changes prior to I-HCA. Increased age was significantly associated with failure to survive to discharge (p < 0.05). Significant change was observed in heart rate including a downtrend of heart rate within 15 min prior to I-HCA (p < 0.05). There was a significant difference in heart rate and QRS duration during the last hour prior to I-HCA compared to the previous hours (p < 0.05). Inferior ECG leads showed the most significant changes in QRS morphology and ST segments prior to I-HCA (p < 0.05). Subjects with an initial rhythm of asystole demonstrated significantly greater ECG changes including QRS morphology and ST segment changes compared to the subjects with initial rhythms of PEA (p < 0.05). Diagnostic ECG trends can be identified prior to I-HCA due to PEA and asystole and can be further utilized for training a predictive machine learning model for I-HCA.

N2  - Non-invasive fetal electrocardiography is still an open research issue. The recent  publication of an annotated dataset on Physionet providing four-channel non-invasive abdominal ECG traces promoted an international challenge on the topic. Starting from that dataset, an algorithm for the identification of the fetal QRS complexes from a reduced number of electrodes and without any a priori information about the electrode positioning has been developed, entering into the top ten best-performing open-source algorithms presented at the challenge.In this paper, an improved version of that algorithm is presented and evaluated exploiting the same challenge metrics. It is mainly based on the subtraction of the maternal QRS complexes in every lead, obtained by synchronized averaging of morphologically similar complexes, the filtering of the maternal P and T waves and the enhancement of the fetal QRS through independent component analysis (ICA) applied on the processed signals before a final fetal QRS detection stage. The RR time series of both the mother and the fetus are analyzed to enhance pseudoperiodicity with the aim of correcting wrong annotations. The algorithm has been designed and extensively evaluated on the open dataset A (N = 75), and finally evaluated on datasets B (N = 100) and C (N = 272) to have the mean scores over data not used during the algorithm development. Compared to the results achieved by the previous version of the algorithm, the current version would mark the 5th and 4th position in the final ranking related to the events 1 and 2, reserved to the open-source challenge entries, taking into account both official and unofficial entrants. On dataset A, the algorithm achieves 0.982 median sensitivity and 0.976 median positive predictivity.

N2  - This paper discusses the effect of atrioventricular conduction time (AVCT) on the  short-term Heart Rate Variability (HRV) by computing HRV parameters using intervals between the onsets of successive P waves (PP time series) for three groups: normal, arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death (SCD) patients. A very precise wavelet transform based ECG delineator was developed to detect PP, PR and RR time series. Mean PR variation in arrhythmia and SCD group was found to be significantly high as compared to the normal group. It was observed that when PR variations in arrhythmia and SCD cases crossed a certain threshold, RR variability no longer provided a very accurate estimate of HRV. In such cases, PP variability was able to provide a better assessment of HRV.

N2  - BACKGROUND: We studied 715 patients 2 weeks after myocardial infarction to test the  hypothesis that short-term power spectral measures of RR variability (calculated from 2 to 15 minutes of normal RR interval data) will predict all-cause mortality or arrhythmic death. METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed power spectral analyses on the entire 24-hour RR interval time series. To compare with the 24-hour analyses, we selected short segments of ECG recordings from two time periods for analysis: 8 AM to 4 PM and midnight to 5 AM. The former corresponds to the time interval during which short-term measures of RR variability would most likely be obtained. The latter, during sleep, represent a period of increased vagal tone, which may simulate the conditions that exist when patients have a signal-averaged ECG recorded, ie, lying quietly in the laboratory. Four frequency domain measures were calculated from spectral analysis of heart period data over a 24-hour interval. We computed the 24-hour power spectral density and calculated the power within three frequency bands: (1) 0.0033 to < 0.04 Hz, very low frequency power, (2) 0.04 to < 0.15 Hz, low frequency power, and (3) 0.15 to 0.40 Hz, high frequency power. In addition, we calculated the ratio of low to high frequency power. These measures were calculated for 15-, 10-, 5-, and 2-minute segments during the day and at night. Mean power spectral values from short periods during the day and night were similar to 24-hour values, and the correlations between short segment values and 24-hour values were strong (many correlations were > or = 0.75). Using the optimal cutpoints determined previously for the 24-hour power spectral values, we compared the survival experience of patients with low values for RR variability in short segments of ECG recordings to those with high values. We found that power spectral measures of RR variability were excellent predictors of all-cause, cardiac, and arrhythmic mortality and sudden death. Patients with low values were 2 to 4 times as likely to die over an average follow-up of 31 months as were patients with high values. The power spectral measures of RR variability did not predict arrhythmic or sudden deaths substantially better than all-cause mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Power spectral measures of RR variability calculated from short (2 to 15 minutes) ECG recordings are remarkably similar to those calculated over 24 hours. The power spectral measures of RR variability are excellent predictors of all-cause mortality and sudden cardiac death.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: A number of small portable systems that can measure HRV are available to  address questions related to autonomic regulation in free-living subjects. However, ambulatory HRV measurements obtained through use of these systems have not previously been validated against standard clinical measurements such as Holter recordings. The objective of this study was to validate HRV obtained using a commonly used system, Actiheart, during occupational and leisure-time activities. METHOD: Full-day ambulatory electrocardiography (ECG) signals were recorded from 8 females simultaneously using Actiheart and Holter recorders, and signals were processed to RR-interval time series. Segments of 5-minute duration were sampled every 30 minutes, and spectral components of the heart rate variability were calculated. Actiheart and Holter values were compared using Deming regression analysis and Bland-Altman plots. RESULTS: In total, 489 segments were available with an HRV value from both Actiheart and Holter recordings after filtering out segments with >10% interpolated beats. No systematic differences between Actiheart and Holter HRV were found. The random deviations between Actiheart and Holter were comparable to the repeatability standard deviation between consecutive Holter measurements. DISCUSSION: The results show that Actiheart is suited as a stand-alone ambulatory method for heart rate variability monitoring during occupational and leisure-time activities.

N2  - This paper addresses the challenge of extracting meaningful information from  measured bioelectric signals generated by complex, large scale physiological systems such as the brain or the heart. We focus on a combination of the well-known Laplacian eigenmaps machine learning approach with dynamical systems ideas to analyze emergent dynamic behaviors. The method reconstructs the abstract dynamical system phase-space geometry of the embedded measurements and tracks changes in physiological conditions or activities through changes in that geometry. It is geared to extract information from the joint behavior of time traces obtained from large sensor arrays, such as those used in multiple-electrode ECG and EEG, and explore the geometrical structure of the low dimensional embedding of moving time windows of those joint snapshots. Our main contribution is a method for mapping vectors from the phase space to the data domain. We present cases to evaluate the methods, including a synthetic example using the chaotic Lorenz system, several sets of cardiac measurements from both canine and human hearts, and measurements from a human brain.

N2  - This study investigates ECG features, focusing on T-wave amplitude, from a wearable  ECG device as a potential method for fitness monitoring in exercise rehabilitation. An automatic T-peak detection algorithm is presented that uses local baseline detection to overcome baseline drift without the need for preprocessing, and offers adequate performance on data recorded in noisy environments. The algorithm is applied to 24 hour data recordings from two subject groups with different physical activity histories. Results indicate that, while mean heart rate (HR) differs most significantly between the groups, T-amplitude features could be useful depending on the disparities in fitness level, and require further investigation on an individual basis.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The QRS complex is the most noticeable feature in the electrocardiogram  (ECG) signal, therefore, its detection is critical for ECG signal analysis. The existing detection methods largely depend on hand-crafted manual features and parameters, which may introduce significant computational complexity, especially in the transform domains. In addition, fixed features and parameters are not suitable for detecting various kinds of QRS complexes under different circumstances. METHODS: In this study, based on 1-D convolutional neural network (CNN), an accurate method for QRS complex detection is proposed. The CNN consists of object-level and part-level CNNs for extracting different grained ECG morphological features automatically. All the extracted morphological features are used by multi-layer perceptron (MLP) for QRS complex detection. Additionally, a simple ECG signal preprocessing technique which only contains difference operation in temporal domain is adopted. RESULTS: Based on the MIT-BIH arrhythmia (MIT-BIH-AR) database, the proposed detection method achieves overall sensitivity Sen = 99.77%, positive predictivity rate PPR = 99.91%, and detection error rate DER = 0.32%. In addition, the performance variation is performed according to different signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) values. CONCLUSIONS: An automatic QRS detection method using two-level 1-D CNN and simple signal preprocessing technique is proposed for QRS complex detection. Compared with the state-of-the-art QRS complex detection approaches, experimental results show that the proposed method acquires comparable accuracy.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Measurements of QRS duration (QRSD) in patients undergoing cardiac  resynchronization therapy (CRT) are not standardized. We hypothesized that both the measurement of QRSD and its predictive value on CRT response are sensitive to the method by which QRSD is measured. METHODS: Electrocardiograms (ECGs) pre- and post-CRT from 52 CRT patients (66 ± 12 years, 65% male) were retrospectively analyzed. Custom-made software was developed to measure global QRSD (QRSDglobal ) and lead-specific QRSD (QRSDI,II,III,aVR,aVL,aVF,V1,V2,V3,V4,V5,V6 ). QRSD was also assessed automatic by a routinely used ECG device. For each method we measured QRSD pre- and post-CRT and shortening of QRSD (∆QRSD). Response to CRT at 6 months was defined as an improvement of ≥1 class in New York Heart Association classification and an increase by >7.5% in left ventricular ejection fraction. RESULTS: The CRT response rate was 77% (n = 40). Different methods to measure QRSD show divergent nominal values before (median range 152-172 ms, P < 0.001) and after CRT (130-152 ms, P < 0.001). The predictive value of QRSD measurements for CRT response also varies significantly according to the method used (range AUC pre-CRT QRSD 0.400-0.580, P < 0.05; AUC post-CRT QRSD 0.447-0.768, P < 0.05; AUC ΔQRSD 0.540-0.858, P < 0.05). Global QRSD measurements revealed lower variability compared to lead-specific QRSD. CONCLUSION: Different methods to measure QRSD yield not only different nominal values but also influence the value of QRSD in predicting CRT response. Measuring QRSD by a global method can help to standardize QRSD measurements in future studies.

N2  - Heart rate variability analysis is a dynamic method to estimate the autonomic  control over the cardiac cycle. Although dysfunction in this control system may appear spontaneously, other deficits may require provocation of the system. In this article we describe a non-invasive method to perturb the autonomic influences on the cardiac cycle. We recorded the ECG and respiratory pressure of ten healthy volunteers while introducing a random forced oscillation pressure wave onto spontaneous respiration. The heart period time series was determined and the power spectra for the 0.05-0.15, 0.15-0.3 and 0.05-0.4 Hz bands were calculated. The random input did not alter mean heart rate. However, the segments with the forced oscillation input demonstrated, on average, a tenfold increase in spectral power averaged across all subjects, with a maximum observed effect of 100-fold increase in power. This increase in power correlated with the respiratory frequency. This study demonstrates that random noise ventilation, such as used in respiratory forced oscillation impedance estimates, significantly alters the autonomic input to cardiac cycle variability in wake subjects.

N2  - The analysis of heart rate variability (HRV) has been performed on long-term  electrocardiography (ECG) recordings (12~24 hours) and short-term recordings (2~5 minutes), which may not capture momentary change of HRV. In this study, we present a new method to analyze the momentary HRV (mHRV). The ECG recordings were segmented into a series of overlapped HRV analysis windows with a window length of 5 minutes and different time increments. The performance of the proposed method in delineating the dynamics of momentary HRV measurement was evaluated with four commonly used time courses of HRV measures on both synthetic time series and real ECG recordings from human subjects and dogs. Our results showed that a smaller time increment could capture more dynamical information on transient changes. Considering a too short increment such as 10 s would cause the indented time courses of the four measures, a 1-min time increment (4-min overlapping) was suggested in the analysis of mHRV in the study. ECG recordings from human subjects and dogs were used to further assess the effectiveness of the proposed method. The pilot study demonstrated that the proposed analysis of mHRV could provide more accurate assessment of the dynamical changes in cardiac activity than the conventional measures of HRV (without time overlapping). The proposed method may provide an efficient means in delineating the dynamics of momentary HRV and it would be worthy performing more investigations.

N2  - The purpose of this research is to propose an algorithm that could accomplish  automatic delineation of the seismocardiogram (SCG) signal without using a reference electrocardiogram R-wave. As a result, the SCG signal could be used, as a stand-alone solution for many cardiovascular medical applications such as hemorrhage detection, cardiac computed tomographic gating, cardiac resynchronization therapy, hemodynamics estimations and diastolic timed vibration. Multiple envelopes were derived from the seismocardiogram signal by using filtering and triple integration. The first envelope is referred as the heart rate envelope, which has the characteristics of having a period of exactly one cardiac cycle and its purpose is to replace the ECG R-wave as a reference point. Our dataset is based on the lower body negative pressure (LBNP) test that was conducted on 18 individuals, containing 21610 cardiac cycles. For 94% of the LBNP dataset, the aforementioned envelope estimated heart rate within 3 beats per minute. Three different peaks of the SCG signal are of our interest: isovolumic contraction (IM), aortic valve opening (AO) and aortic valve closure (AC). For each of these desired peaks of the SCG signal, a different envelope was designed in a manner that its peak is very close to IM, AO and AC, respectively. For the same lower body negative pressure data set, a mean difference of (9, 9, 6) and standard deviation of (8, 9, 9) millisecond between the peak of envelopes and IM, AO and AC is accomplished. This could be used as a good initial estimation of the annotation points.

N2  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to retrospectively assess the accuracy of the  maximal left atrial volume (LAV(max)) measured at 75% of the cardiac cycle compared to the 40% measurements and to evaluate this volume according to age and gender. PATIENTS AND METHOD: A total of 150 patients with a mean age of 50±17 (SD) years (range: 21-79 years) were analyzed. There were 78 men and 72 women. LAV(max) were measured from retrospective triphasic cardiac-gated multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT) data at the 40% (LAV(40)) and 75% (LAV(75)) of the RR cycle phases by a semi-automatic method. RESULTS: LAV(40)was 50.7±14mL/m(2) and LAV(75) was 42.5±13mL/m(2). The difference was statistically significant. Considering the reference range of LAV(max) reported in the literature, 33% of the patients had enlarged LA with LAV(40) and only 17% with LAV(75). These volumes were positively influenced by age but not by gender. The relationship between LAV(75) and LAV(40) was: LAV(75)=0.908 LAV(40)-3.486 (r(2)=0.92) or LAV(40)=1.1×LAV(75)+3.8 (r(2)=0.92). CONCLUSION: LAV(max) measured at the 75% of the cardiac cycle phase significantly underestimates actual LAV leading to reconsider normal values. LAV(40) can be computed from the measured value of LAV(75) obtained on prospective ECG-gated MDCT.

N2  - One of the biggest challenges in averaging ECG or EEG signals is to overcome  temporal misalignments and distortions, due to uncertain timing or complex non-stationary dynamics. Standard methods average individual leads over a collection of epochs on a time-sample by time-sample basis, even when multi-electrode signals are available. Here we propose a method that averages multi electrode recordings simultaneously by using spatial patterns and without relying on time or frequency.

N2  - It is significant to establish scene ECG database which improves the automatic  diagnostic function of electrocardiograph under different application scenarios. We built the ECG database in different scene according to the hospital level (grade 3, grade 2, grade 1) and clinical environment (intensive care and acute wards, outpatient clinics and general wards). Sample size was obtained according to the incidence of various ECG diagnoses. The database covers ECG signal, ECG waveform, ECG characteristic values, ECG diagnostic results by experts and clinical information of patients etc. It not only provides important reference for electrocardiograph manufacturers to evaluate and test the parameters of automatic diagnosis under different clinical scene, but also provides valuable scientific research and teaching resources for medical workers.

N2  - Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a serious cardiovascular disease with the phenomenon of  beating irregularly. It is the major cause of variety of heart diseases, such as myocardial infarction. Automatic AF beat detection is still a challenging task which needs further exploration. A new framework, which combines modified frequency slice wavelet transform (MFSWT) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), was proposed for automatic AF beat identification. MFSWT was used to transform 1 s electrocardiogram (ECG) segments to time-frequency images, and then, the images were fed into a 12-layer CNN for feature extraction and AF/non-AF beat classification. The results on the MIT-BIH Atrial Fibrillation Database showed that a mean accuracy (Acc) of 81.07% from 5-fold cross validation is achieved for the test data. The corresponding sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp), and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) results are 74.96%, 86.41%, and 0.88, respectively. When excluding an extremely poor signal quality ECG recording in the test data, a mean Acc of 84.85% is achieved, with the corresponding Se, Sp, and AUC values of 79.05%, 89.99%, and 0.92. This study indicates that it is possible to accurately identify AF or non-AF ECGs from a short-term signal episode.

N2  - To observe the effect of sub-hypothermia (HT) blood purification technique in the  treatment of cardiac shock after heart valve disease.The patients were randomly divided into normothermic (NT) continuous blood purification (CBP) group (NT group) and HT CBP group (HT group). Observe the cardiac index (CI), the oxygen delivery (DO2) and oxygen consumption (VO2) ratio, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation III(APACHE III) score, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) score, dynamic monitoring of electrocardiograph, blood loss with or without muscle tremors, intensive care unit stay, mechanical ventilation time, CBP time, and the cases of infection and mortality at 0 day, 1 day, 2 day, 3 day; all above indicators were compared between 2 groups.Ninety-five patients were randomly assigned into HT group (48 cases) and NT group (47 cases); there were no significant differences between the 2 groups for age, gender, pre-operative cardiac function, cardiothoracic ratio, and type of valve replacement (P > .05). There were no significant differences among the 1 day, 2 day, 3 day after recruited for CI, DO2/VO2 ratio, APACHE III score, MODS score (P > .05). But in HT group, DO2/VO2 ratio had been significantly improved after treatment for 1 day (2.5 ± 0.7 vs 1.8 ± 0.4, P = .024), and CI (3.0 ± 0.5 vs 1.9 ± 0.7, P = .004), APACHE III score (50.6 ± 6.2 vs 77.5 ± 5.5 P = .022), MODS score (6.0 ± 1.5 vs 9.3 ± 3.4, P = .013) also had been significantly improved after treatment for 3 days. In clinical outcomes, there were no significant differences between 2 groups for blood loss (617.0 ± 60.7 ml vs 550.9 ± 85.2 ml, P = .203), infection ratio (54.17% vs 53.19%, P = .341), the incidence of ventricular arrhythmia (31.25% vs 36.17%, P = .237), and muscle tremors (14.58% vs 8.51%, P = .346), while there were significant differences between 2 groups for intensive care unit stay (6.9 ± 3.4 days vs 12.5 ± 3.5 days, P = .017,), mechanical ventilation time (4.2 ± 1.3 days vs 7.5 ± 2.7 days, P = .034,), CBP time (4.6 ± 1.4 days vs 10.5 ± 4.0 days, P = .019), mortality (12.50% vs 23.40%, P = .024). But the incidence of bradycardia in HT group was much higher than the NT group (29.16% vs 14.89%, P = .029).HT blood purification is a safer and more effective treatment than NT blood purification for patients who suffered from cardiac shock after valve surgery.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the accuracy of paper cardiopulmonary resuscitation records.  DESIGN: Case series. SETTING: Twenty-six-bed video-monitored pediatric cardiac ICU. PATIENTS: All patients who had a resuscitation event with available video and electronically stored vital sign and waveform data from May 2012 to February 2013. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: There were 41 cardiopulmonary resuscitation events during the study period. Fifteen had complete and valid data from the paper cardiopulmonary resuscitation forms, the retrieved monitor data, and the continuous bedside video monitoring. These 15 events occurred in 12 individual patients, and there was 100% agreement of data in the documentation of interventions in place (ventilation, arterial catheter, pulse oximetry, and vascular access) and in the presence of a witness at the onset of the arrest. All events were witnessed. Of the 15 events, video and monitor review revealed that 14 used waveform and numeric capnometry to confirm endotracheal tube/tracheostomy placement, but this section was only completed on the paper cardiopulmonary resuscitation record in three of the 14 cases. All records showed no discrepancies in the time of return of spontaneous circulation. The video and monitor review revealed delay in initiating cardiopulmonary resuscitation (mode, 2 min; two cases ≥ 7 min) and shockable rhythms (ventricular arrhythmia) in two cases. A sign of pulseless state was discovered in seven cases classified on the paper record as "always with a pulse." Those include sudden loss of consciousness, flat arterial line tracing, and abrupt drop in the partial pressure of exhaled carbon dioxide tracing (< 10 mm Hg). CONCLUSIONS: Eyewitness accounts of cardiopulmonary resuscitation are often inaccurate and incomplete. Review of information from video and electronically stored vital sign and waveform data provides more accurate information than review of paper-based cardiopulmonary resuscitation records and may provide the insight necessary to improving cardiopulmonary resuscitation.

N2  - The automatic and unsupervised analysis of biomedical time series is of primary  importance for diagnostic and preventive medicine, enabling fast and reliable data processing to reveal clinical insights without the need for human intervention. Representation learning (RL) methods perform an automatic extraction of meaningful features that can be used, e.g., for a subsequent classification of the measured data. The goal of this study is to explore and quantify the benefits of RL techniques of varying degrees of complexity, focusing on modern deep learning (DL) architectures. We focus on the automatic classification of atrial fibrillation (AF) events from noisy single-lead electrocardiographic signals (ECG) obtained from wireless sensors. This is an important task as it allows the detection of sub-clinical AF which is hard to diagnose with a short in-clinic 12-lead ECG. The effectiveness of the considered architectures is quantified and discussed in terms of classification performance, memory/data efficiency and computational complexity.

N2  - Hypertension (HT) is an extreme increment in blood pressure that can prompt a  stroke, kidney disease, and heart attack. HT does not show any symptoms at the early stage, but can lead to various cardiovascular diseases. Hence, it is essential to identify it at the beginning stages. It is tedious to analyze electrocardiogram (ECG) signals visually due to their low amplitude and small bandwidth. Hence, to avoid possible human errors in the diagnosis of HT patients, an automated ECG-based system is developed. This paper proposes the computerized segregation of low-risk hypertension (LRHT) and high-risk hypertension (HRHT) using ECG signals with an optimal orthogonal wavelet filter bank (OWFB) system. The HRHT class is comprised of patients with myocardial infarction, stroke, and syncope ECG signals. The ECG-data are acquired from physionet's smart health for accessing risk via ECG event (SHAREE) database, which contains recordings of a total 139 subjects. First, ECG signals are segmented into epochs of 5 min. The segmented epochs are then decomposed into six wavelet sub-bands (WSBs) using OWFB. We extract the signal fractional dimension (SFD) and log-energy (LOGE) features from all six WSBs. Using Student's t-test ranking, we choose the high ranked WSBs of LOGE and SFD features. We develop a novel hypertension diagnosis index (HDI) using two features (SFD and LOGE) to discriminate LRHT and HRHT classes using a single numeric value. The performance of our developed system is found to be encouraging, and we believe that it can be employed in intensive care units to monitor the abrupt rise in blood pressure while screening the ECG signals, provided this is tested with an extensive independent database.

N2  - Cardiac computed tomography angiography (CCTA) studies have risen concern of  radiobiological effects over the patients. Therefore, estimating radiation doses absorbed during CCTA is important. In this study, we compared radiation dose and image quality by using three different retrospective electrocardiography (ECG) protocols. A total of 123 patients undergoing CCTA were divided in three different groups. We used full-dose modulation (CareDose4D) technique in group (1); fixed tube current 200 mAs for group (2); and in group (3), chest circumference was used to adapt tube current (180-200 mAs) and tube potential (100-120 kVp). For groups (1) and (2), tube potential adapted depends on body mass index (BMI) in which it was 100 kVp for BMI < 27 kg/m2, and 120 kVp for BMI ≥ 27 kg/m2. Quantitive assessment of image quality was calculated by measuring signal intensity (SI) and image noise (IN) in the proximal segments of aorta root on left and right coronary arteries. Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) were also calculated by using SI and IN. Two experienced radiologists using a 4-point scale assessed the subjective image quality. Our results show that in group (1), the mean effective dose was 4.46 mSv (range: 1.75-8.6 mSv) and for group (2), the mean effective radiation dose was 5.07 mSv (range: 2.57-9.74 mSv) and in group (3), the mean effective dose was 5.85 mSv (range: 3.36-12.17 mSv). Group (1) representing 12% and 23% decrease in radiation dose comparing by groups (2) and (3). In multivariate analysis, adjusting for BMI, radiation dose for patients with BMI < 27 kg/m2 was significantly different; 2.53 mSv for group (1) compared to 3.54 mSv in group (2) and 5.207 in group (3) (p < 0.0001). In addition, lowering tube potential from 120 to 100 kVp in 200 mAs fixed tube current, represents 27% decrease in radiation dose. The quantitative image quality (IN, SI, SNR and CNR) was not statistically significant among the groups. To sum up, Retrospective-ECG gating may reduce radiation dose by using automatic tube current modulation and 100kVp tube potential with preservation of image quality in patient's whose BMI < 27 kg/m2.

N2  - The electrocardiogram (ECG) acquisition is often accompanied by high-frequency  electromyographic (EMG) noise. The noise is difficult to be filtered, due to considerable overlapping of its frequency spectrum to the frequency spectrum of the ECG. Today, filters must conform to the new guidelines (2007) for low-pass filtering in ECG with cutoffs of 150 Hz for adolescents and adults, and to 250 Hz for children. We are suggesting a pseudo-real-time low-pass filter, self-adjustable to the frequency spectra of the ECG waves. The filter is based on the approximation procedure of Savitzky-Golay with dynamic change in the cutoff frequency. The filter is implemented pseudo-real-time (real-time with a certain delay). An additional option is the automatic on/off triggering, depending on the presence/absence of EMG noise. The analysis of the proposed filter shows that the low-frequency components of the ECG (low-power P- and T-waves, PQ-, ST- and TP-segments) are filtered with a cutoff of 14 Hz, the high-power P- and T-waves are filtered with a cutoff frequency in the range of 20-30 Hz, and the high-frequency QRS complexes are filtered with cutoff frequency of higher than 100 Hz. The suggested dynamic filter satisfies the conflicting requirements for a strong suppression of EMG noise and at the same time a maximal preservation of the ECG high-frequency components.

N2  - Measuring the instantaneous frequency of a signal rapidly and accurately is  essential in many applications. However, the instantaneous frequency by definition is a parameter difficult to determine. Fourier-based methods introduce estimation delays as computations are performed in a time-window. Instantaneous methods based on the Hilbert transform lack robustness. State-of-the-art adaptive filters yield accurate estimates, however, with an adaptation delay. In this study we propose an algorithm based on short length-3 FIR notch filters to estimate the instantaneous frequency of a signal at each sample, in a real-time manner and with very low delay. The output powers of a bank of the above-mentioned filters are used in a recursive weighting scheme to estimate the dominant frequency of the input. This scheme has been extended to process multiple inputs containing a common frequency by introducing an additional weighting scheme upon the inputs. The algorithm was tested on synthetic data and then evaluated on real biomedical data, i.e. the estimation of the respiratory rate from the electrocardiogram. It was shown that the proposed method provided more accurate estimates with less delay than those of state-of-the-art methods. By virtue of its simplicity and good performance, the proposed method is a worthy candidate to be used in biomedical applications, for example in health monitoring developments based on portable and automatic devices.

N2  - Sudden cardiac arrest is one of the leading causes of death in the industrialized  world. Pulse detection is essential for the recognition of the arrest and the recognition of return of spontaneous circulation during therapy, and it is therefore crucial for the survival of the patient. This paper introduces the first method based exclusively on the ECG for the automatic detection of pulse during cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Random forest classifier is used to efficiently combine up to nine features from the time, frequency, slope, and regularity analysis of the ECG. Data from 191 cardiac arrest patients was used, and 1177 ECG segments were processed, 796 with pulse and 381 without pulse. A leave-one-patient out cross validation approach was used to train and test the algorithm. The statistical distributions of sensitivity (SE) and specificity (SP) for pulse detection were estimated using 500 patient-wise bootstrap partitions. The mean (std) SE/SP for nine-feature classifier was 88.4 (1.8) %/89.7 (1.4) %, respectively. The designed algorithm only requires 4-s-long ECG segments and could be integrated in any commercial automated external defibrillator. The method permits to detect the presence of pulse accurately, minimizing interruptions in cardiopulmonary resuscitation therapy, and could contribute to improve survival from cardiac arrest.

N2  - This work presents a modelling approach to accurately predict the blood pressure  (BP) waveform time series from a single input signal. A nonlinear autoregressive model with exogenous input (NARX) is implemented using artificial neural networks and trained on Electrocardiography (ECG) signals to predict the BP waveform. The efficacy of the model is demonstrated using the MIMIC II database. The proposed method can accurately estimate systolic and diastolic BP. The NARX model together with ECG measurement allows continuous monitoring of BP, enables the estimation of other physiological measurements, such as the cardiac output, and provides more insight on the patient health condition.

N2  - In this paper, we propose a new approach for heartbeat classification based on a  combination of morphological and dynamic features. Wavelet transform and independent component analysis (ICA) are applied separately to each heartbeat to extract morphological features. In addition, RR interval information is computed to provide dynamic features. These two different types of features are concatenated and a support vector machine classifier is utilized for the classification of heartbeats into one of 16 classes. The procedure is independently applied to the data from two ECG leads and the two decisions are fused for the final classification decision. The proposed method is validated on the baseline MIT-BIH arrhythmia database and it yields an overall accuracy (i.e., the percentage of heartbeats correctly classified) of 99.3% (99.7% with 2.4% rejection) in the "class-oriented" evaluation and an accuracy of 86.4% in the "subject-oriented" evaluation, comparable to the state-of-the-art results for automatic heartbeat classification.

N2  - PURPOSE: The cardiac gating signal (CGS) in positron emission tomography (PET)  studies is usually obtained from an electrocardiography (ECG) monitor. In this work, we propose a method to obtain the CGS in small-animal PET using the acquired list-mode data without using any hardware or end-user input. PROCEDURES: The CGS was obtained from the number of coincidences over time acquired in the lines-of-response connected with the cardiac region. This region is identified in the image as its value changes with frequencies in the range of 3 to 12 Hz. The procedure was tested in a study with 29 Wistar rats and 6 mice injected with 2-deoxy-2-[(18)F]fluoro-D-glucose, which underwent a 45-min single-bed list-mode PET scan of the heart syncronized with an ECG. The estimated signals and the reconstructed images using eight-gated frames were compared with the ones obtained using the ECG signal from the monitor. RESULTS: The differences of the PET-based CGS with respect to the ECG relative to the duration of the heartbeats were 5.6 % in rats and 11.0 % in mice. The reconstructed gated images obtained from the proposed method do not differ qualitatively with respect to the ones obtained with the ECG. The quantitative analysis of both set of images were performed measuring the volume of the left ventricle (LV) of the rats in the end-of-systole and end-of-diastole phase. The differences found in these parameters between both methods were below 12.1 % in the ESV and 9.3 % in the EDV with a 95 % confidence interval, which are comparable to the accuracy (7 %) of the method used for segmenting the LV. CONCLUSION: The proposed method is able to provide a valid and accurate CGS in small-animal PET list-mode data.

N2  - For the development of a totally implantable ventricular assist system (VAS), we  have been developing the vibrating flow pump (VFP), which can generate oscillated blood flow with a relative high frequency (10-50 Hz) for a totally implantable system. In this study, the effects of left ventricular assistance with this unique oscillated blood flow were analyzed by the use of nonlinear mathematics for evaluation as the whole circulatory regulatory system, not as the decomposed parts of the system. Left heart bypasses using the VFP from the left atrium to the descending aorta were performed in chronic animal experiments using healthy adult goats. The ECG, arterial blood pressure, VFP pump flow, and the flow of the descending aorta were recorded in the data recorder during awake conditions and analyzed in a personal computer system through an A-D convertor. By the use of nonlinear mathematics, time series data were embedded into the phase space, the Lyapunov numerical method, fractal dimension analysis, and power spectrum analysis were performed to evaluate nonlinear dynamics. During left ventricular assistance with the VFP, Mayer wave fluctuations were decreased in the power spectrum, the fractal dimension of the hemodynamics was significantly decreased, and peripheral vascular resistance was significantly decreased. These results suggest that nonlinear dynamics, which mediate the cardiovascular dynamics, may be affected during left ventricular (LV) bypass with oscillated flow. The decreased power of the Mayer wave in the spectrum caused the limit cycle attractor of the hemodynamics and decreased peripheral resistance. Decreased sympathetic discharges may be the origin of the decreased Mayer wave and fractal dimension. These nonlinear dynamic analyses may be useful to design optimal VAS control.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Most patients presenting to US Emergency Departments (ED) with chest  pain are hospitalized for comprehensive testing. These evaluations cost the US health system >$10 billion annually, but have a diagnostic yield for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) of <10%. The history/ECG/age/risk factors/troponin (HEART) Pathway is an accelerated diagnostic protocol (ADP), designed to improve care for patients with acute chest pain by identifying patients for early ED discharge. Prior efficacy studies demonstrate that the HEART Pathway safely reduces cardiac testing, while maintaining an acceptably low adverse event rate. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of HEART Pathway ADP implementation within a health system. METHODS: This controlled before-after study will accrue adult patients with acute chest pain, but without ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction on electrocardiogram for two years and is expected to include approximately 10,000 patients. Outcomes measures include hospitalization rate, objective cardiac testing rates (stress testing and angiography), length of stay, and rates of recurrent cardiac care for participants. RESULTS: In pilot data, the HEART Pathway decreased hospitalizations by 21%, decreased hospital length (median of 12 hour reduction), without increasing adverse events or recurrent care. At the writing of this paper, data has been collected on >5000 patient encounters. The HEART Pathway has been fully integrated into health system electronic medical records, providing real-time decision support to our providers. CONCLUSIONS: We hypothesize that the HEART Pathway will safely reduce healthcare utilization. This study could provide a model for delivering high-value care to the 8-10 million US ED patients with acute chest pain each year.

N2  - Spectral analysis of heart rate variability has recently been shown to be a reliable  noninvasive test for quantitative assessment of cardiovascular automatic regulatory responses. In 12 ambulant normotensive healthy young males (mean age 23 +/- 1 years) after a period of 10 min. for stabilisation, a continuous ecg recording (lead CM-5) for 8 min. was obtained in the supine and standing position, with a controlled respiration rate 15/min. Power spectrum of 512 point time series (R-R intervals) in both positions was calculated using a fast Fourier transform-based window periodogram method. Based upon results from the literature the power spectrum analysis was performed on two components: low frequency LF (0.05-0.15 Hz) and high frequency HF (0.15-0.50 Hz). Mean R-R interval decreased on standing position from 0.79 +/- 0.10 s to 0.59 +/- 0.11 s (p less than 0.001). The ratio HF/LF in supine was 0.63 +/- 0.70 and on standing position 2.54 +/- 0.73 (p less than 0.001). The relative LF component of the total HR power spectrum increased from 22.8% +/- 12.1% to 42.9 +/- 14.4% (p less than 0.001) after changing the position from supine to standing, and the relative HF component decreased from 56.3 +/- 22.4% to 25.5 +/- 16.2 (p less than 0.001). The total power was significantly lower when standing in comparison to supine position (681 +/- 519 s2, 1188 +/- 963 s2 respectively, p less than 0.05). Our results suggest that heart rate fluctuations in supine position in normal men are mainly vagally determined (HF power spectrum component).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

N2  - AIMS: automatic detection of the QRS complex on electrocardiogram (ECG) is used on  cardiac ultrasound scanners to separate ultrasound image series into cardiac cycles for playback and storage. On small hand-held scanners it is unpractical to connect ECG cables. We therefore aim to do automatic cardiac cycle separation using apical B-mode ultrasound images. METHODS AND RESULTS: cardiac cycle length is estimated by cyclicity analysis of B-mode intensities. To determine a cycle start estimate near QRS, a deformable model is fitted to the left ventricle in real-time. The model is used to initialize and constrain a speckle tracker positioned near the mitral annulus. In the displacement curve generated by the speckle tracker, a time point near maximum distance from the probe is detected as a cardiac cycle start estimate. Validation against ECG was done on 233 recordings from normal subjects and 46 recordings from subjects with coronary pathology. Several test cases were run for each recording to emulate B-mode series starting at all time points in the cardiac cycle. Totally, 11 886 test cases were run. Cycle length estimation was feasible in 98% of normal subject cases and 91% of pathology cases. Median difference in cycle length by ECG was 0 and -3 ms, respectively. Cycle start estimation was feasible in 90% of normal subject cases and 77% of pathology cases. Median difference to cycle start by ECG was 62 and 76 ms, respectively. CONCLUSION: apical B-mode series can automatically be separated into cardiac cycles without using ECG.

N2  - In this Letter, the authors propose an efficient and robust method for automatically  determining the VT and VF events in the electrocardiogram (ECG) signal. The proposed method consists of: (i) discrete cosine transform (DCT)-based noise suppression; (ii) addition of bipolar sequence of amplitudes with alternating polarity; (iii) zero-crossing rate (ZCR) estimation-based VTVF detection; and (iv) peak-to-peak interval (PPI) feature based VT/VF discrimination. The proposed method is evaluated using 18,000 episodes of different ECG arrhythmias taken from 6 PhysioNet databases. The method achieves an average sensitivity (Se) of 99.61%, specificity (Sp) of 99.96%, and overall accuracy (OA) of 99.92% in detecting VTVF and non-VTVF episodes by using a ZCR feature. Results show that the method achieves a Se of 100%, Sp of 99.70% and OA of 99.85% for discriminating VT from VF episodes using PPI features extracted from the processed signal. The robustness of the method is tested using different kinds of ECG beats and various types of noises including the baseline wanders, powerline interference and muscle artefacts. Results demonstrate that the proposed method with the ZCR, PPI features can achieve significantly better detection rates as compared with the existing methods.

N2  - Balloon floatation pulmonary artery catheters (PACs) have been used for hemodynamic  monitoring in cardiac, medical, and surgical intensive care units since the 1970s. With the availability of newer noninvasive diagnostic modalities, particularly echocardiography, the frequency of diagnostic pulmonary artery catheterization has declined. In this review, the evolution of PACs, the results of nonrandomized and randomized studies in various clinical conditions, the uses and abuses of bedside hemodynamic monitoring, and current indications for pulmonary artery catheterization are discussed.

N2  - In this paper, a technique for the automatic detection of any recurrent pattern in  ECG time series is introduced. The wavelet transform is used to obtain a multiresolution representation of some example patterns for signal structure extraction. Neural Networks are trained with the wavelet transformed templates providing an efficient detector even for temporally varying patterns within the complete time series. The method is also robust against offsets and stable for signal to noise ratios larger than one. Its reliability was tested on 60 Holter ECG recordings of patients at the Department of Cardiology (University of Bonn). Due to the convincing results and its fast implementation the method can easily be used in clinical medicine. In particular, it solves the problem of automatic P wave detection in Holter ECG recordings.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: The objectives of this study were to provide baseline normative values  for circadian changes in the time-series data collected over the course of a normal day in laboratory-housed dogs and to assess the relative efficiency of standard correction formulas to correct for the variations in QT intervals and heart rate functions. METHODS: One hundred and twenty-three beagle dogs (65 M, 58 F) were equipped with radiotelemetry transmitters and continuously monitored, while freely moving in their home cages. Electrocardiograms (ECGs), hemodynamic parameters (diastolic, systolic, and mean arterial pressures) as well as core body temperatures were recorded for 22 h. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Blood pressures and core body temperatures demonstrated only very slight variations in their respective values over the 22-h monitoring period. ECGs were measured by a computerized waveform analysis program and quantitative elements reported as RR, PR, QRS, and QT intervals. Little circadian rhythmicity was demonstrated in the ECG intervals. Standard study-specific correction formulas appeared to satisfactorily normalize (i.e., compensate for) the relationship between heart rate and QT intervals in these beagle dogs but elevated the values of the QTc as compared to the uncorrected QT intervals. In sharp contrast, a subject-specific correction method based on analysis of covariance produced a more linear function between heart rates and QT intervals and, more importantly, provided QTc values within the normal range of actual, recorded QT interval data.

N2  - Electrocardiograms (ECGs) recorded from patients in intensive care were investigated  to quantify any relationship between ECG signal quality and false monitoring alarms. False alarms are a considerable problem for nursing and medical staff as they distract from clinical care, and are also a problem for patients as they disturb rest, which is important for clinical recovery. ECG and alarm data were obtained for 750 patient alarms from the PhysioNet database. The final 8 s period before the alarm was triggered was investigated. All but one ECG channel in 38 ECG recordings with out-of-range data were associated with false positive alarms (p  <  0.0001). The frequency contributions for baseline (BL) instability, electromyogram (EMG) muscle noise, and high frequency (HF) noise were calculated. For all three frequency bands, the contributions associated with false positive alarms were very significantly greater than for true positive alarms (p  <  0.0001). The greatest difference was for BL with a mean level for false positive alarms 4.0 times greater than for true positive alarms, followed by EMG and HF at 1.6 times and 1.4 times respectively. These results confirm that attention needs to be taken to improve ECG signal quality to reduce the frequency of clinical false alarms, and hence improve conditions for clinical staff and patients.

N2  - High false alarm rates in the ICU decrease quality of care by slowing staff response  times while increasing patient delirium through noise pollution. The 2015 PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge provides a set of 1250 multi-parameter ICU data segments associated with critical arrhythmia alarms, and challenges the general research community to address the issue of false alarm suppression using all available signals. Each data segment was 5 minutes long (for real time analysis), ending at the time of the alarm. For retrospective analysis, we provided a further 30 seconds of data after the alarm was triggered. A total of 750 data segments were made available for training and 500 were held back for testing. Each alarm was reviewed by expert annotators, at least two of whom agreed that the alarm was either true or false. Challenge participants were invited to submit a complete, working algorithm to distinguish true from false alarms, and received a score based on their program's performance on the hidden test set. This score was based on the percentage of alarms correct, but with a penalty that weights the suppression of true alarms five times more heavily than acceptance of false alarms. We provided three example entries based on well-known, open source signal processing algorithms, to serve as a basis for comparison and as a starting point for participants to develop their own code. A total of 38 teams submitted a total of 215 entries in this year's Challenge. This editorial reviews the background issues for this challenge, the design of the challenge itself, the key achievements, and the follow-up research generated as a result of the Challenge, published in the concurrent special issue of Physiological Measurement. Additionally we make some recommendations for future changes in the field of patient monitoring as a result of the Challenge.

N2  - A miniaturized accelerometer attached to the heart has been used for monitoring  functional parameters such as early systolic velocity and displacement. Currently, processing of the accelerometer signal for derival of these functional parameters depends on determining start systole by detecting the ECG R-peaks. This study proposes an alternative method using only the accelerometer signal to detect start systole, making additional ECG recordings for this purpose redundant. A signal processing method for automatic detection of start systole by accelerometer alone was developed and compared with detected R-peaks in 15 pigs during 5 different interventions showing a difference of 30 ± 17 ms. Furthermore, the derived early systolic velocity and displacement using only accelerometer measurements correlated well (r(2)=0.91 and 0.82, respectively) with minor differences compared to the current method using ECG R-peaks as time reference. The results show that an accelerometer can be used to monitor cardiac function without the need to measure ECG which can simplify the monitoring system.

N2  - BACKGROUND: A collaboration led by the American Heart Association recently released  the scientific statement "Prevention of Torsade de Pointes in Hospital Settings." Patients receiving proarrhythmic drugs, who have electrolyte disturbances, or who have bradyarrhythmias require QT-interval monitoring. Prior studies have demonstrated that physicians have a poor level of proficiency at calculating QT intervals. The ability of nurses at calculating QT intervals remains untested. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate nurses' knowledge and ability to perform QT/QTc interval monitoring. METHODS: At a single institution, 47 QT-education classes were provided to 480 eligible nurses who regularly perform cardiac monitoring. All nurses completed a researcher-developed knowledge test at baseline and after the QT-related education intervention. RESULTS: Overall 379 nurses participated (mean age 39 [SD, 10] years), 71% had more than 5 years' nursing experience. Total test scores increased after intervention (46% vs 77%, P < .001). Education significantly improved marking of the QT/RR intervals (QT: 65% vs 91%, RR: 83% vs 90%, P ≤ .001 and P = .02) and measurement of the QT/RR intervals (QT: 47% vs 84%, RR: 35% vs 71% P ≤ .001 and P ≤ .001). Calculation of the QTc interval also increased significantly (6% vs 52%, P ≤ .001). CONCLUSIONS: Our study results demonstrate that nurses' baseline ability to perform QT interval monitoring is extremely poor. An unacceptable amount of error persists after an educational intervention. Accurate computer-assisted methods are needed to reduce the error associated with manual QT-interval monitoring.

N2  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: In this work, we develop a fully automatic and real-time  ventricular heartbeat classifier based on a single ECG lead. Single ECG lead classifiers can be especially useful for wearable technologies that provide continuous and long-term monitoring of the electrocardiogram. These wearables usually have a few non-standard leads and the quality of the signals depends on the user physical activity. METHODS: The proposed method uses an Echo State Network (ESN) to classify ECG signals following the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) recommendations with an inter-patient scheme. To achieve real-time classification, the classifier itself and the feature extraction approach are fast and computationally efficient. In addition, our approach allows transferring the knowledge from one database to another without additional training. RESULTS: The classification performance of the proposed model is validated on the MIT-BIH arrhythmia and INCART databases. The sensitivity and precision of the proposed method for MIT-BIH arrhythmia database are 95.3 and 88.8 for the modified lead II and 90.9 and 89.2 for the V1 lead. The results reported are further compared to the existing methodologies in literature. Our methodology is a competitive single lead ventricular heartbeat classifier, that is comparable to state-of-the-art algorithms using multiple leads. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed fully automated, single-lead and real-time heartbeat classifier of ventricular heartbeats reports an improved classification accuracy in different leads of the evaluated databases in comparison with other single lead heartbeat classifiers. These results open the possibility of applying our methodology to wearable long-term monitoring devices with an unconventional placement of the electrodes.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: The search for objective clinical signs is a constant practitioners' and  researchers' concern in psychiatry. New technologies (embedded sensors, artificial intelligence) give an easier access to untapped information such as passive data (i.e. that do not require patient intervention). The concept of "digital phenotype" is emerging in psychiatry: a psychomotor alteration translated by accelerometer's modifications contrasting with the usual functioning of the subject, or the graphorrhea of patients presenting a manic episode which is replaced by an increase of SMS sent. Our main objective is to highlight the digital phenotype of mood disorders by means of a selective review of the literature. METHOD: We conducted a selective review of the literature by querying the PubMed database until February 2017 with the terms [Computer] [Computerized] [Machine] [Automatic] [Automated] [Heart rate variability] [HRV] [actigraphy] [actimetry] [digital] [motion] [temperature] [Mood] [Bipolar] [Depression] [Depressive]. Eight hundred and forty-nine articles were submitted for evaluation, 37 articles were included. RESULTS: For unipolar disorders, smartphones can diagnose depression with excellent accuracy by combining GPS and call log data. Actigraphic measurements showing daytime alteration in basal function while ECG sensors assessing variation in heart rate variability (HRV) and body temperature appear to be useful tools to diagnose a depressive episode. For bipolar disorders, systems which combine several sensors are described: MONARCA, PRIORI, SIMBA and PSYCHE. All these systems combine passive and active data on smartphones. From a synthesis of these data, a digital phenotype of the disorders is proposed based on the accelerometer and the GPS, the ECG, the body temperature, the use of the smartphone and the voice. This digital phenotype thus brings into question certain clinical paradigms in which psychiatrists evolve. CONCLUSION: All these systems can be used to computerize the clinical characteristics of the various mental states studied, sometimes with greater precision than a clinician could do. Most authors recommend the use of passive data rather than active data in the context of bipolar disorders because automatically generated data reduce biases and limit the feeling of intrusion that self-questionnaires may cause. The impact of these technologies questions the psychiatrist's professional culture, defined as a specific language and a set of common values. We address issues related to these changes. Impact on psychiatrists could be important because their unity seems to be questioned due to technologies that profoundly modify the collect and process of clinical data.

N2  - In this work, arrhythmia appearing with the presence of abnormal heart electrical  activity is efficiently recognized and classified. A novel method is proposed for accurate recognition and classification of cardiac arrhythmias. Firstly, P-QRS-T waves is segmented from ECG waveform; secondly, morphological features are extracted from P-QRS-T waves, and ECG segment features are extracted from the selected ECG segment by using PCA and dynamic time warping(DTW); finally, SVM is applied to the features and automatic diagnosis results is presented. ECG data set used is derived from the MIT-BIH in which ECG signals are divided into the four classes: normal beats(N), supraventricular ectopic beats (SVEBs), ventricular ectopic beats (VEBs) and fusion of ventricular and normal (F). Our proposed method can distinguish N, SVEBs, VEBs and F with an accuracy of 97.80 percent. The sensitivities for the classes N, SVEBs, VEBs and F are 99.27, 87.47, 94.71, and 73.88 percent and the positive predictivities are 98.48, 95.25, 95.22 and 86.09 percent respectively. The detection sensitivity of SVEBs and VEBs has a better performance by combining proposed features than by using the ECG morphology or ECG segment features separately. The proposed method is compared with four selected peer algorithms and delivers solid results.

N2  - The authors describe a rare case of "concealed" congenital Long QT Syndrome (LQTS)  Type 3 in a patient with treatment resistant schizophrenia and no known personal or family history of cardiac disease. The patient in this Case Report had a hidden genetic condition revealed only following the essential administration of antipsychotics. As a result, this patient experienced an aborted cardiac arrest and a total of five episodes of ventricular tachycardia (VT) requiring cardioversion. Successful control of the VT occurred with an Automatic Internal Defibrillator (AID), judicious use of antipsychotic medications, and anti-arrhythmic medications. Risk factors for this rare anomaly include history of syncopy, unexplained ventricular arrhythmias, history of sudden cardiac death in a young family member, unusual reaction to initial dosages of medication known to prolong QTc which includes antipsychotics (particularly in combination). The work-up for those with risk factors would be a thorough family history of sudden cardiac death, baseline ECG, electrolytes, cardiology and electrophysiological consultation, and when indicated a genetic analysis for the Long QT Syndrome (LQTS). Monitoring includes ongoing patient assessment for symptoms, ECGs and electrolytes when indicated such as when medication and dosages are adjusted, AID interviewing, and cardiac and electrophysiological follow-up.

N2  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Myocardial infarction (MI) is a myocardial anoxic  incapacitation caused by severe cardiovascular obstruction that can cause irreversible injury or even death. In medical field, the electrocardiogram (ECG) is a common and effective way to diagnose myocardial infarction, which often requires a wealth of medical knowledge. It is necessary to develop an approach that can detect the MI automatically. METHODS: In this paper, we propose a multi-branch fusion framework for automatic MI screening from 12-lead ECG images, which consists of multi-branch network, feature fusion and classification network. First, we use text detection and position alignment to automatically separate twelve leads from ECG images. Then, those 12 leads are input into the multi-branch network constructed by a shallow neural network to get 12 feature maps. After concatenating those feature maps by depth fusion, classification is explored to judge the given ECG is MI or not. RESULTS: Based on extensive experiments on an ECG image dataset, performances of different combinations of structures are analyzed. The proposed network is compared with other networks and also compared with physicians in the practical use. All the experiments verify that the proposed method is effective for MI screening based on ECG images, which achieves accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and F1-score of 94.73%, 96.41%, 95.94% and 93.79% respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Rather than using the typical one-dimensional electrical ECG signal, this paper gives an effective model to screen MI by analyzing 12-lead ECG images. Extracting and analyzing these 12 leads from their corresponding ECG images is a good attempt in the application of MI screening.

N2  - Over past few years our group has been working on the development of a low-cost  device, ARTSENS, for measurement of local arterial stiffness (AS) of the common carotid artery (CCA). This uses a single element ultrasound transducer to obtain A-mode frames from the CCA. It is designed to be fully automatic in its operation such that, a general medical practitioner can use the device without any prior knowledge of ultrasound modality. Placement of the probe over CCA and identification of echo positions corresponding to its two walls are critical steps in the process of measurement of AS. We had reported an algorithm to locate the CCA walls based on their characteristic motion. Unfortunately, in supine position, the internal jugular vein (IJV) expands in the carotid triangle and pulsates in a manner that confounds the existing algorithm and leads to wrong measurements of the AS. Jugular venous pulse (JVP), on its own right, is a very important physiological signal for diagnosis of morbidities of the right side of the heart and there is a lack of noninvasive methods for its accurate estimation. We integrated an ECG device to the existing hardware of ARTSENS and developed a method based on physiology of the vessels, which now enable us to segregate the CCA pulse (CCP) and the JVP. False identification rate is less than 4%. To retain the capabilities of ARTSENS to operate without ECG, we designed another method where the classification can be achieved without an ECG, albeit errors are a bit higher. These improvements enable ARTSENS to perform automatic measurement of AS even in the supine position and make it a unique and handy tool to perform JVP analysis.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Heart rate variability (HRV) arises from the complex interplay of  sympathetic and parasympathetic autonomic regulation of heart rate. Ultra-low frequency (ULF) and very-low frequency (VLF) components of HRV play a crucial role in automatic HR controllers, but these frequency bands have hitherto largely been neglected in HRV studies. The aim of this work was to investigate changes in ULF and VLF heart rate variability with respect to exercise intensity and time during treadmill running. METHODS: RR intervals were determined by ECG in 21 healthy male participants at rest, and during moderate and vigorous-intensity treadmill running; each of these three tests had a duration of 45 min. Time dependence of HRV was investigated for moderate and vigorous running intensities by dividing the constant-speed stages into three consecutive windows of equal duration ([Formula: see text] 14 min), denoted [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text]. ULF and VLF power were computed using Lomb-Scargle power spectral density estimates. RESULTS: For both the ULF and VLF frequency bands, mean power was significantly different between the resting, moderate and vigorous intensity levels (overall [Formula: see text]): mean power was lower for moderate vs. rest ([Formula: see text]), for vigorous vs. rest ([Formula: see text]), and for vigorous vs. moderate ([Formula: see text]). For both ULF and VLF and moderate intensity, mean power was significantly different between the three time windows (overall [Formula: see text] for ULF, overall [Formula: see text] for VLF): for ULF, mean power was lower for [Formula: see text] vs. [Formula: see text] ([Formula: see text]) and for [Formula: see text] vs. [Formula: see text] ([Formula: see text]); for VLF, mean power was lower for [Formula: see text] vs. [Formula: see text] ([Formula: see text]). For ULF and vigorous intensity, there was no significant difference in mean power between the three time windows (overall [Formula: see text]). For VLF and vigorous intensity, mean power was significantly different between [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] (overall [Formula: see text]): mean power was lower for [Formula: see text] vs. [Formula: see text] ([Formula: see text]) and for [Formula: see text] vs. [Formula: see text] ([Formula: see text]). CONCLUSIONS: The degree of HRV in terms of ULF and VLF power was found to decrease with increasing intensity of exercise. HRV was also observed to decrease over time, but it remains to clarify whether these changes are due to time itself or to increases in HR related to cardiovascular drift. For feedback control applications, attention should be focused on meeting performance targets at low intensity and during the early stages of exercise.

N2  - This paper reviews the methods used for editing of the R-R interval time series and  how this editing can influence the results of heart rate (HR) variability analyses. Measurement of HR variability from short and long-term electrocardiographic (ECG) recordings is a non-invasive method for evaluating cardiac autonomic regulation. HR variability provides information about the sympathetic-parasympathetic autonomic balance. One important clinical application is the measurement of HR variability in patients suffering from acute myocardial infarction. However, HR variability signals extracted from R-R interval time series from ambulatory ECG recordings often contain different amounts of artifact. These false beats can be either of physiological or technical origin. For instance, technical artifact may result from poorly fastened electrodes or be due to motion of the subject. Ectopic beats and atrial fibrillation are examples of physiological artifact. Since ectopic and other false beats are common in the R-R interval time series, they complicate the reliable analysis of HR variability sometimes making it impossible. In conjunction with the increased usage of HR variability analyses, several studies have confirmed the need for different approaches for handling false beats present in the R-R interval time series. The editing process for the R-R interval time series has become an integral part of these analyses. However, the published literature does not contain detailed reviews of editing methods and their impact on HR variability analyses. Several different editing and HR variability signal pre-processing methods have been introduced and tested for the artifact correction. There are several approaches available, i.e., use of methods involving deletion, interpolation or filtering systems. However, these editing methods can have different effects on HR variability measures. The effects of editing are dependent on the study setting, editing method, parameters used to assess HR variability, type of study population, and the length of R-R interval time series. The purpose of this paper is to summarize these pre-processing methods for HR variability signal, focusing especially on the editing of the R-R interval time series.

N2  - Short-term cardiovascular regulation mediated by the sympathetic and parasympathetic  branches of the autonomic nervous system has been investigated by multivariate autoregressive (MVAR) modeling, providing insightful analysis. MVAR models employ, as inputs, heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP) and respiratory waveforms. ECG (from which HR series is obtained) and respiratory flow waveform (RFW) can be easily sampled from the patients. Nevertheless, the available methods for acquisition of beat-to-beat SBP measurements during exams hamper the wider use of MVAR models in clinical research. Recent studies show an inverse correlation between pulse wave transit time (PWTT) series and SBP fluctuations. PWTT is the time interval between the ECG R-wave peak and photoplethysmography waveform (PPG) base point within the same cardiac cycle. This study investigates the feasibility of using inverse PWTT (IPWTT) series as an alternative input to SBP for MVAR modeling of the cardiovascular regulation. For that, HR, RFW, and IPWTT series acquired from volunteers during postural changes and autonomic blockade were used as input of MVAR models. Obtained results show that IPWTT series can be used as input of MVAR models, replacing SBP measurements in order to overcome practical difficulties related to the continuous sampling of the SBP during clinical exams.

N2  - The dynamics of heartbeat interval fluctuations were studied in awake unrestrained  mice following intracerebroventricular application of the neuropeptide corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF). The cardiac time series derived from telemetric ECG monitoring were analyzed by non-parametric techniques of nonlinear signal processing: delay-vector variance (DVV) analysis, higher-order variability (HOV) analysis, empirical mode decomposition (EMD), multiscale embedding-space decomposition (MESD), multiexponent multifractal (MEMF) analysis. The analyses support the conjecture that cardiac dynamics of normal control mice has both deterministic and stochastic elements, is nonstationary, nonlinear, and exerts multifractal properties. Central application of CRF results in bradycardia and increased variability of the beat-to-beat fluctuations. The altered dynamical properties elicited by CRF reflect a significant loss of intrinsic structural complexity of cardiac control which is due to central neuroautonomic hyperexcitation, i.e., enhanced sympatho-vagal antagonism. The change in dynamical complexity is characterized by an effect referred to as fractal rigidity, leading to a significant impairment of adaptability to extrinsic challenges in a fluctuating environment. The impact of dynamical neurocardiopathy as a major precipiting factor for the propensity of cardiac arrhythmias or sudden cardiac death by unchecked central CRF release in significant acute life events in man is critically discussed.

N2  - We present a real-time method for the detection of motion and noise (MN) artifacts,  which frequently interferes with accurate rhythm assessment when ECG signals are collected from Holter monitors. Our MN artifact detection approach involves two stages. The first stage involves the use of the first-order intrinsic mode function (F-IMF) from the empirical mode decomposition to isolate the artifacts' dynamics as they are largely concentrated in the higher frequencies. The second stage of our approach uses three statistical measures on the F-IMF time series to look for characteristics of randomness and variability, which are hallmark signatures of MN artifacts: the Shannon entropy, mean, and variance. We then use the receiver-operator characteristics curve on Holter data from 15 healthy subjects to derive threshold values associated with these statistical measures to separate between the clean and MN artifacts' data segments. With threshold values derived from 15 training data sets, we tested our algorithms on 30 additional healthy subjects. Our results show that our algorithms are able to detect the presence of MN artifacts with sensitivity and specificity of 96.63% and 94.73%, respectively. In addition, when we applied our previously developed algorithm for atrial fibrillation (AF) detection on those segments that have been labeled to be free from MN artifacts, the specificity increased from 73.66% to 85.04% without loss of sensitivity (74.48%-74.62%) on six subjects diagnosed with AF. Finally, the computation time was less than 0.2 s using a MATLAB code, indicating that real-time application of the algorithms is possible for Holter monitoring.

N2  - Mathematical models for synthesizing ECGs are important tools in providing  reproducible standard signals for biomedical signal processing research and technology. The ECG synthesis model ECGsyn and its extensions are the state of the art and realistically capture: 1) the ECG morphology; 2) the spectrum of heart rate variability; and 3) QT-interval adaptation to heart rate. This paper demonstrates ECGsyn's time-domain limitations at reconstructing an ECG time series from ECG wave annotations. An alternative algorithm, ECGfm, is therefore presented that recreates the event intervals with greater fidelity by applying the wave annotations as a phase constraint. Results on data drawn from the Physionet Physobank QT database demonstrate the improved performance of the ECGfm algorithm.

N2  - The diagnosis of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) usually relies on the analysis of  complex polysomnographic measurements performed in specialized sleep centers. Automatic signal analysis is a promising approach to reduce the diagnostic effort. This paper addresses SDB and sleep assessment solely based on the analysis of a single-channel ECG recorded overnight by a set of signal analysis modules. The methodology of QRS detection, SDB analysis, calculation of ECG-derived respiration curves, and estimation of a sleep pattern is described in detail. SDB analysis detects specific cyclical variations of the heart rate by correlation analysis of a signal pattern and the heart rate curve. It was tested with 35 SDB-annotated ECGs from the Apnea-ECG Database, and achieved a diagnostic accuracy of 80.5%. To estimate sleep pattern, spectral parameters of the heart rate are used as stage classifiers. The reliability of the algorithm was tested with 18 ECGs extracted from visually scored polysomnographies of the SIESTA database; 57.7% of all 30 s epochs were correctly assigned by the algorithm. Although promising, these results underline the need for further testing in larger patient groups with different underlying diseases.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Depolarization abnormalities are hardly detectable by standard 12-lead  electrocardiogram (ECG) in some patients. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the value of the 16-lead High-Definition (HD)-ECG machine to record conduction abnormalities including Epsilon waves in patients with structural heart disease. METHODS: Tracings with 12-lead ECG, 16-lead HD-ECG, and signal-averaged ECG were studied. RESULTS: (1) Case of severe coronary artery disease (CAD): On 16-lead HD-ECG, a tiny intra-QRS signal was noted in lead III, a prolonged P wave in lead II, and fragmentation on top of lead aVL and lead aVF. Proper automatic measurement of the prolonged P wave measuring 190 ms was noted. Signal-averaging by 16-lead HD-ECG in lead III showed the intra-QRS fragmentation and P wave prolongation of 180 ms. (2) First patient with arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (ARVD): Standard 12-lead ECG indicated Epsilon waves in lead III, V2, V3, and inverted T waves in V1-V3. 16-lead HD-ECG indicated QRS prolongation in lead II, III, aVL, aVF, V2, V3 as opposed to V6, and low amplitudes of QRS complexes in V4R and V3R as a new possible sign of ARVD. Notches in lead V2, widening of QRS complexes in all precordial leads, but shorter QRS in V8-V9 are also considered as a potential new diagnostic sign of ARVD. (3) Second ARVD patient: Notches at the end of the QRS in lead III and a negative initial deflection of the QRS in V1 and V2 were detected by standard 12-lead ECG. On 16-lead HD-ECG, a more pronounced QRS fragmentation was visible. CONCLUSION: 16-lead HD-ECG in both CAD and ARVD seems to be more sensitive than 12-lead ECG to record electrocardiographic abnormalities.

N2  - This paper presents a useful technique for totally automatic detection of myocardial  infarction from patients' ECGs. Due to the large number of heartbeats constituting an ECG and the high cost of having all the heartbeats manually labeled, supervised learning techniques have achieved limited success in ECG classification. In this paper, we first discuss the rationale for applying multiple instance learning (MIL) to automated ECG classification and then propose a new MIL strategy called latent topic MIL, by which ECGs are mapped into a topic space defined by a number of topics identified over all the unlabeled training heartbeats and support vector machine is directly applied to the ECG-level topic vectors. Our experimental results on real ECG datasets from the PTB diagnostic database demonstrate that, compared with existing MIL and supervised learning algorithms, the proposed algorithm is able to automatically detect ECGs with myocardial ischemia without labeling any heartbeats. Moreover, it improves classification quality in terms of both sensitivity and specificity.

N2  - Accurate detection of fiducial points in a seismocardiogram (SCG) is a challenging  research problem for its clinical application. In this paper, an automated method for detecting aortic valve opening (AO) instants using the dorso-ventral component of the SCG signal is proposed. This method does not require electrocardiogram (ECG) as a reference signal. After preprocessing the SCG, multiscale wavelet decomposition is carried out to get signal components in different wavelet subbands. The subbands having possible AO peaks are selected by a newly proposed dominant-multiscale-kurtosis- and dominant-multiscale-central-frequency-based criterion. The signal is reconstructed using selected subbands, and it is emphasized using the weights derived from the proposed relative squared dominant multiscale kurtosis. The Shannon energy followed by autocorrelation coefficients is computed for systole envelope construction. Finally, AO peaks are detected by a Gaussian-derivative-filtering-based scheme. The robustness of the proposed method is tested using clean and noisy SCG signals from the combined measurement of ECG, breathing, and SCG database. Evaluation results show that the method can achieve an average sensitivity of 94%, a prediction rate of 90%, and a detection accuracy of 86% approximately over 4585 analyzed beats.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: In this paper, we propose a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based deep  learning architecture for multiclass classification of obstructive sleep apnea and hypopnea (OSAH) using single-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings. OSAH is the most common sleep-related breathing disorder. Many subjects who suffer from OSAH remain undiagnosed; thus, early detection of OSAH is important. APPROACH: In this study, automatic classification of three classes-normal, hypopnea, and apnea-based on a CNN is performed. An optimal six-layer CNN model is trained on a training dataset (45 096 events) and evaluated on a test dataset (11 274 events). The training set (69 subjects) and test set (17 subjects) were collected from 86 subjects with length of approximately 6 h and segmented into 10 s durations. MAIN RESULTS: The proposed CNN model reaches a mean [Formula: see text]-score of 93.0 for the training dataset and 87.0 for the test dataset. SIGNIFICANCE: Thus, proposed deep learning architecture achieved a high performance for multiclass classification of OSAH using single-lead ECG recordings. The proposed method can be employed in screening of patients suspected of having OSAH.

N2  - Using food as a stimuli is known to cause multiple psychophysiological reactions.  Heart rate variability (HRV) is common tool for assessing physiological reactions in autonomic nervous system. However, the findings in HRV related to food stimuli have not been consistent. In this paper the quick changes in HRV related to positive and negative food and non-food visual stimuli are investigated. Electrocardiogram (ECG) was measured from 18 healthy females while being stimulated with the pictures. Subjects also filled Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire to determine their eating behavior. The inter-beat-interval time series and the HRV parameters were extracted from the ECG. The quick change in HRV parameters were studied by calculating the change from baseline value (10 s window before stimulus) to value after the onset of the stimulus (10 s window during stimulus). The paired t-test showed significant difference between positive and negative food pictures but not between positive and negative non-food pictures. All the HRV parameters decreased for positive food pictures while they stayed the same or increased a little for negative food pictures. The eating behavior characteristic cognitive restraint was negatively correlated with HRV parameters that describe decreasing of heart rate.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: The timing of defibrillation is mostly at arbitrary intervals during  cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR), rather than during intervals when the out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OOH-CA) patient is physiologically primed for successful countershock. Interruptions to CPR may negatively impact defibrillation success. Multiple defibrillations can be associated with decreased post-resuscitation myocardial function. We hypothesize that a more complete picture of the cardiovascular system can be gained through non-linear dynamics and integration of multiple physiologic measures from biomedical signals. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective analysis of 153 anonymized OOH-CA patients who received at least one defibrillation for ventricular fibrillation (VF) was undertaken. A machine learning model, termed Multiple Domain Integrative (MDI) model, was developed to predict defibrillation success. We explore the rationale for non-linear dynamics and statistically validate heuristics involved in feature extraction for model development. Performance of MDI is then compared to the amplitude spectrum area (AMSA) technique. RESULTS: 358 defibrillations were evaluated (218 unsuccessful and 140 successful). Non-linear properties (Lyapunov exponent > 0) of the ECG signals indicate a chaotic nature and validate the use of novel non-linear dynamic methods for feature extraction. Classification using MDI yielded ROC-AUC of 83.2% and accuracy of 78.8%, for the model built with ECG data only. Utilizing 10-fold cross-validation, at 80% specificity level, MDI (74% sensitivity) outperformed AMSA (53.6% sensitivity). At 90% specificity level, MDI had 68.4% sensitivity while AMSA had 43.3% sensitivity. Integrating available end-tidal carbon dioxide features into MDI, for the available 48 defibrillations, boosted ROC-AUC to 93.8% and accuracy to 83.3% at 80% sensitivity. CONCLUSION: At clinically relevant sensitivity thresholds, the MDI provides improved performance as compared to AMSA, yielding fewer unsuccessful defibrillations. Addition of partial end-tidal carbon dioxide (PetCO2) signal improves accuracy and sensitivity of the MDI prediction model.

N2  - Automatic identification of biosignals is one of the more studied fields in  biomedical engineering. In this paper, we present an approach for the unsupervised recognition of biomedical signals: Microelectrode Recordings (MER) and Electrocardiography signals (ECG). The unsupervised learning is based in classic and bayesian estimation theory. We employ gaussian mixtures models with two estimation methods. The first is derived from the frequentist estimation theory, known as Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. The second is obtained from bayesian probabilistic estimation and it is called variational inference. In this framework, both methods are used for parameters estimation of Gaussian mixtures. The mixtures models are used for unsupervised pattern classification, through the responsibility matrix. The algorithms are applied in two real databases acquired in Parkinson's disease surgeries and electrocardiograms. The results show an accuracy over 85% in MER and 90% in ECG for identification of two classes. These results are statistically equal or even better than parametric (Naive Bayes) and nonparametric classifiers (K-nearest neighbor).

N2  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the study was to investigate the short- and long-term  variations in the non-linear dynamics of heart rate variability, and to determine the relationships between conventional time and frequency domain methods and the newer non-linear methods of characterizing heart rate variability. METHODS: Twelve healthy subjects were investigated by 3-h ambulatory ECG recordings repeated on 3 separate days. Correlation dimension, non-linear predictability, mean heart rate, and heart rate variability in the time and frequency domains were measured and compared with the results from corresponding surrogate time series. RESULTS: A small significant amount of non-linear dynamics exists in heart rate variability. Correlation dimensions and non-linear predictability are relatively specific parameters for each individual examined. The correlation dimension is inversely correlated to the heart rate and describes mainly linear correlations. Non-linear predictability is correlated with heart rate variability measured as the standard deviation of the R-R intervals and the respiratory activity expressed as power of the high-frequency band. The dynamics of heart rate variability changes suddenly even during resting, supine conditions. The abrupt changes are highly reproducible within the individual subjects. CONCLUSIONS: The study confirms that the correlation dimension of the R-R intervals is mostly due to linear correlations in the R-R intervals. A small but significant part is due to non-linear correlations between the R-R intervals. The different measures of heart rate variability (correlation dimension, average prediction error, and the standard deviation of the R-R intervals) characterize different properties of the signal, and are therefore not redundant measures. Heart rate variability cannot be described as a single chaotic system. Instead heart rate variability consists of intertwined periods with different non-linear dynamics. It is hypothesized that the heart rate is governed by a system with multiple "strange" attractors.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the potential value of heart rate variability features for  automated monitoring of sedation levels in mechanically ventilated ICU patients. DESIGN: Multicenter, pilot study. SETTING: Several ICUs at Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA. PATIENTS: Electrocardiogram recordings from 40 mechanically ventilated adult patients receiving sedatives in an ICU setting were used to develop and test the proposed automated system. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale scores were acquired prospectively to assess patient sedation levels and were used as ground truth. Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale scores were grouped into four levels, denoted "unarousable" (Richmond Agitation- Sedation Scale = -5, -4), "sedated" (-3, -2, -1), "awake" (0), "agitated" (+1, +2, +3, +4). A multiclass support vector machine algorithm was used for classification. Classifier training and performance evaluations were carried out using leave-oneout cross validation. An overall accuracy of 69% was achieved for discriminating between the four levels of sedation. The proposed system was able to reliably discriminate (accuracy = 79%) between sedated (Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale < 0) and nonsedated states (Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale > 0). CONCLUSIONS: With further refinement, the methodology reported herein could lead to a fully automated system for depth of sedation monitoring. By enabling monitoring to be continuous, such technology may help clinical staff to monitor sedation levels more effectively and to reduce complications related to over- and undersedation.

N2  - Power spectral analysis of time series derived from the R-wave morphology of the ECG  was employed to identify a suitable lead configuration for the detection of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) using the electrocardiogram (ECG). 16 subjects (46 +/- 9.2 yrs, 8 males), who did not report problems during sleep, and 13 subjects previously diagnosed with SDB (49 +/- 8.8 yrs, 7 males) underwent an overnight sleep study at an accredited sleep center. Power values derived from the spectra of the R-peaks envelope were tested for their sensitivity and specificity in discriminating between epochs containing normal breathing from epochs containing SDB. Of the three tested lead configurations using two parameters NB1 and NB2 derived from the power spectrum, lead I produced the best results with a sensitivity of 92.8% and a specificity of 88.0% for the case of parameter NB1 and a sensitivity of 85.7% and a specificity of 76.0% for the case of parameter NB2.

N2  - CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Long QT syndrome (LQTS) is a cardiac electrophysiologic  disorder, characterized by QT prolongation and T-wave abnormalities on the ECG that are associated with tachyarrhythmias, typically the ventricular tachycardia torsade de pointes (TdP). TdP is usually self-terminating, thus causing a syncopal event, the most common symptom in individuals with LQTS. Such cardiac events typically occur during exercise and emotional stress, less frequently during sleep, and usually without warning. In some instances, TdP degenerates to ventricular fibrillation and causes aborted cardiac arrest (if the individual is defibrillated) or sudden death. Approximately 50% of untreated individuals with a pathogenic variant in one of the genes associated with LQTS have symptoms, usually one to a few syncopal events. While cardiac events may occur from infancy through middle age, they are most common from the preteen years through the 20s. Some types of LQTS are associated with a phenotype extending beyond cardiac arrhythmia. In addition to the prolonged QT interval, associations include muscle weakness and facial dysmorphism in Andersen-Tawil syndrome (LQTS type 7); hand/foot, facial, and neurodevelopmental features in Timothy syndrome (LQTS type 8); and profound sensorineural hearing loss in Jervell and Lange-Nielson syndrome. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: Diagnosis of LQTS is established by prolongation of the QTc interval in the absence of specific conditions known to lengthen it (for example, QT-prolonging drugs) and/or by molecular genetic testing that identifies a diagnostic change (or changes) in one or more of the 15 genes known to be associated with LQTS – of which KCNH2 (LQT2), KCNQ1 (locus name LQT1), and SCN5A (LQT3) are the most common. Approximately 20% of families meeting clinical diagnostic criteria for LQTS do not have detectable pathogenic variants in a known gene. LQTS associated with biallelic pathogenic variants or heterozygosity for pathogenic variants in two different genes (i.e., digenic pathogenic variants) is generally associated with a more severe phenotype with longer QTc interval. MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Beta blocker medication is the primary treatment for LQTS; possible implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICD) and/or left cardiac sympathetic denervation (LCSD) for those with beta-blocker-resistant symptoms, inability to take beta blockers, and/or history of cardiac arrest. Sodium channel blockers can be useful as additional pharmacologic therapy for patients with a QTc interval >500 ms. Prevention of primary manifestations: Beta blockers are clinically indicated in all asymptomatic individuals meeting diagnostic criteria, including those who have a pathogenic variant on molecular testing and a normal QTc interval. In general, ICD implantation is not indicated for individuals with LQTS who are asymptomatic and who have not been tried on beta blocker therapy. Prophylactic ICD therapy can be considered for individuals with LQTS who are asymptomatic but suspected to be at very high risk (e.g., those with ≥2 pathogenic variants on molecular testing). Surveillance: Regular assessment of beta blocker dose for efficacy and adverse effects in all individuals with LQTS, especially children during rapid growth; regular periodic evaluations of ICDs for inappropriate shocks and pocket or lead complications. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Drugs that cause further prolongation of the QT interval or provoke torsade de pointes; competitive sports / activities associated with intense physical activity and/or emotional stress for most individuals. Evaluation of relatives at risk: Presymptomatic diagnosis and treatment is warranted in relatives at risk to prevent syncope and sudden death. Other: For some individuals, availability of automatic external defibrillators at home, at school, and in play areas. GENETIC COUNSELING: LQTS is typically inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. An exception is LQTS associated with sensorineural deafness (known as Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome), which is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Most individuals diagnosed with LQTS have an affected parent. The proportion of LQTS caused by a de novo pathogenic variant is small. Each child of an individual with autosomal dominant LQTS has a 50% risk of inheriting the pathogenic variant. Penetrance of the disorder may vary. Prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk and preimplantation genetic diagnosis are possible once the pathogenic variant(s) have been identified in the family.

N2  - PURPOSE: To explore changes in stimulant utilization and pre-treatment  electrocardiography (ECG) screening in response to cardiovascular (CV) safety concerns. METHODS: Two source populations were established from Florida Medicaid Fee-for-service beneficiaries between 2001 and 2008: approximately 44 571 newly diagnosed attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder patients and 33 000 new stimulant users. Time-series design and Joinpoint analysis were used to describe monthly trend changes in stimulant initiation, persistence, dosing, and pre-treatment ECG screening. RESULTS: Initial and maintenance daily dose declined 6 mg (95% confidence interval [CI] -14 to -1.9) methylphenidate (MPH) equivalent dose from a steady 27 mg after Canada withdrew Adderall XR in February 2005; the trend rebounded to a daily dose of 23 mg, after the remarketing of Adderall XR and a debate in the US over issuing a boxed warning on stimulant CV safety in early 2006. Monthly initiation increased 3.9% (CI -1.0 to 9.1) after the boxed warning debate to 54 per 100 patients per month (CI 44 to 68), but declined 2.4% (CI -3.6 to -1.2) after requirement of medication guides in February 2007. Monthly ECG screening increased 3.2% (CI 2.3 to 4.2) after Adderall XR withdrawal and further increased 13% (CI 4 to 23) after the American Heart Association recommended pre-treatment ECG screening to 40 per 100 patients per month (CI 17 to 48). CONCLUSIONS: The first signal of stimulant CV safety concerns was followed by varying responses depending on the outcome measure used, suggesting that patients and physicians responded at different times after the publicity of safety concerns. Clinical consequences of the changes are uncertain. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

N2  - Systolic time intervals are highly correlated to fundamental cardiac functions.  Several studies have shown that these measurements have significant diagnostic and prognostic value in heart failure condition and are adequate for long-term patient follow-up and disease management. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of using heart sound (HS) to accurately measure the opening and closing moments of the aortic heart valve. These moments are crucial to define the main systolic timings of the heart cycle, i.e. pre-ejection period (PEP) and left ventricular ejection time (LVET). We introduce an algorithm for automatic extraction of PEP and LVET using HS and electrocardiogram. PEP is estimated with a Bayesian approach using the signal's instantaneous amplitude and patient-specific time intervals between atrio-ventricular valve closure and aortic valve opening. As for LVET, since the aortic valve closure corresponds to the start of the S2 HS component, we base LVET estimation on the detection of the S2 onset. A comparative assessment of the main systolic time intervals is performed using synchronous signal acquisitions of the current gold standard in cardiac time-interval measurement, i.e. echocardiography, and HS. The algorithms were evaluated on a healthy population, as well as on a group of subjects with different cardiovascular diseases (CVD). In the healthy group, from a set of 942 heartbeats, the proposed algorithm achieved 7.66 ± 5.92 ms absolute PEP estimation error. For LVET, the absolute estimation error was 11.39 ± 8.98 ms. For the CVD population, 404 beats were used, leading to 11.86 ± 8.30 and 17.51 ± 17.21 ms absolute PEP and LVET errors, respectively. The results achieved in this study suggest that HS can be used to accurately estimate LVET and PEP.

N2  - Rapid automatic detection of the fiducial points-namely, the P wave, QRS complex,  and T wave-is necessary for early detection of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). In this paper, we present an R peak detection method using the wavelet transform (WT) and a modified Shannon energy envelope (SEE) for rapid ECG analysis. The proposed WTSEE algorithm performs a wavelet transform to reduce the size and noise of ECG signals and creates SEE after first-order differentiation and amplitude normalization. Subsequently, the peak energy envelope (PEE) is extracted from the SEE. Then, R peaks are estimated from the PEE, and the estimated peaks are adjusted from the input ECG. Finally, the algorithm generates the final R features by validating R-R intervals and updating the extracted R peaks. The proposed R peak detection method was validated using 48 first-channel ECG records of the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database with a sensitivity of 99.93%, positive predictability of 99.91%, detection error rate of 0.16%, and accuracy of 99.84%. Considering the high detection accuracy and fast processing speed due to the wavelet transform applied before calculating SEE, the proposed method is highly effective for real-time applications in early detection of CVDs.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study is to develop a right-ventricular (RV) phase  analysis tool which when coupled with our left ventricular (LV) phase analysis tool can provide measurement of the interventricular mechanical dyssynchrony from gated SPECT myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI), and validate the tool by electrocardiography (ECG). METHODS: For each patient, short-axis LV and RV SPECT MPI images were input into an automatic sampling algorithm to generate the 3D maximal count circumferential profiles for both LV and RV in each cardiac frame. Subsequently, the samples of LV and RV were separately used by our phase analysis tool based on the first-harmonic Fourier approximation to calculate the contraction onset for each sample. The difference between contraction onsets of the middle LV free wall and middle LV septal wall represented the LV contraction delay; the difference between contraction onsets of the middle RV free wall and middle RV septal wall represented the RV contraction delay. The difference between the LV and RV contraction delays represented the interventricular contraction delay, which was compared with the interventricular conduction delay classified by ECG to validate the concordance of interventricular mechanical and electrical dyssynchrony. Sixty-one bundle branch block (BBB) patients with ischemic-dilated cardiomyopathy (26, 42.6%) or non-ischemic-dilated cardiomyopathy (35, 57.4%), who underwent 12-lead surface ECG and gated resting Tc-99m sestamibi SPECT, were retrospectively analyzed in this study. RESULTS: In the 30 patients with left bundle branch block (LBBB) by ECG, there were 27 patients whose LV contracted later than the RV according to SPECT; and in the 31 patients with right bundle branch block (RBBB) by ECG, there were 26 patients whose LV contracted earlier than the RV according to SPECT. In total, an agreement rate of 86.9% (53 of 61) was achieved between SPECT and ECG. The Kappa agreement rate was 73.8% (95% confidence interval 0.57-0.91). CONCLUSION: The preliminary results showed promise for the measurement of interventricular mechanical dyssynchrony in BBB patients with dilated cardiomyopathy using our phase analysis tool.

N2  - The aim of this case study was to evaluate electrocardiographic diagnosis of Brugada  syndrome. Our study involved a 43-year old man of Indian origin coming for consultation due to acute chest pain. The patient suffered from untreated stage 2 hypertension and had a family history of sudden death (his father died at the age of 40 years). ECG showed an incomplete right bundle-branch block with descendant displacement of the ST segment dome-shaped at right precordial level; coronary angiography was normal, which led us to the diagnosis of type I Brugada syndrome. The patient underwent implantation of an implantable automatic defibrillator in Reunion Island and regular follow-up.

N2  - Özsoylu S, Akyıldız BN, Dursun A, Pamukçu Ö. Could you say that was an atrial  flutter or not? Turk J Pediatr 2019; 61: 608-610. Muscle-tremor artefact is a potential cause of misdiagnosis of atrial arrhythmias on electrocardiography (ECG) monitoring. Such errors may lead to inappropriate and potentially dangerous therapies in some patients. We present a case of a patient with uncontrolled seizures whose bedside electrocardiogram monitor analysis appeared to demonstrate atrial flutter with 4:1 conduction through the AV node. The ECG monitor and ECG rhythm strip additionally showed a regular ventricular rate of 94 bpm with an underlying regular `saw-tooth` baseline. We applied cardioversion to convert to sinus rhythm. Amiodarone was loaded and added to the patients therapy who had atrial flutter after cardioversion. Echocardiogram was performed by a pediatric cardiologist and they noted that the atrial rate and ventricular rate were equal. After this, we began to suspect this situation might be a pseudoflutter due to his muscle contractions. We applied rocuronium to the patient to understand whether this was a pseudo-flutter or not. We saw that the ECG returned to normal sinus rhythm. Physicians especially working in intensive care units should be aware of artifact to avoid unnecessary therapeutic procedures. As Hippocrates said centuries ago `First, do no harm.`.

N2  - The paper proposes a modification of the nonlinear state-space projections (NSSP)  method. Our approach, when applied to ECG signal processing, considerably improves the method's performance. One of the crucial operations in NSSP is the search for neighborhoods of the state-space trajectory points. The modification proposed is based on imposing a few restrictions on the time location of the neighborhood points. Dynamic time warping, a technique which allows for nonlinear alignment of time series or sequences of vectors, is applied as a straightforward solution to the task of neighborhoods determination with the restrictions imposed. The influence of nonlinear alignment on the distributions of the determined neighborhoods is presented, and the resulting method of ECG enhancement is investigated.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Epileptic onsets often affect the autonomic function of the body during a  seizure, whether it is in ictal, interictal or post-ictal periods. The different effects of localization and lateralization of seizures on heart rate variability (HRV) emphasize the importance of autonomic function changes in epileptic patients. On the other hand, the detection of seizures is of primary interests in evaluating the epileptic patients. In the current paper, we analyzed the HRV signal to develop a reliable offline seizure-detection algorithm to focus on the effects of lateralization on HRV. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We assessed the HRV during 5-min segments of continuous electrocardiogram (ECG) recording with a total number of 170 seizures occurred in 16 patients, composed of 86 left-sided and 84 right-sided focus seizures. Relatively high and low-frequency components of the HRV were computed using spectral analysis. Poincaré parameters of each heart rate time series considered as non-linear features. We fed these features to the Support Vector Machines (SVMs) to find a robust classification method to classify epileptic and non-epileptic signals. Leave One Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV) approach was used to demonstrate the consistency of the classification results. RESULTS: Our obtained classification accuracy confirms that the proposed scheme has a potential in classifying HRV signals to epileptic and non-epileptic classes. The accuracy rates for right-sided and left-sided focus seizures were obtained as 86.74% and 79.41%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The main finding of our study is that the patients with right-sided focus epilepsy showed more reduction in parasympathetic activity and more increase in sympathetic activity. It can be a marker of impaired vagal activity associated with increased cardiovascular risk and arrhythmias. Our results suggest that lateralization of the seizure onset zone could exert different influences on heart rate changes. A right-sided seizure would cause an ictal tachycardia whereas a left-sided seizure would result in an ictal bradycardia.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: The key to a successful analysis of a pacemaker electrocardiogram  (ECG) is the application of the systematic approach used for any other ECG without a pacemaker: analysis of (1) basic rhythm and rate, (2) QRS axis, (3) PQ, QRS and QT intervals, (4) morphology of P waves, QRS, ST segments and T(U) waves and (5) the presence of arrhythmias. METHODS: If only the most obvious abnormality of a pacemaker ECG is considered, wrong conclusions can easily be drawn. If a systematic approach is skipped it may be overlooked that e.g. atrial pacing is ineffective, the left ventricle is paced instead of the right ventricle, pacing competes with intrinsic conduction or that the atrioventricular (AV) conduction time is programmed too long. Apart from this analysis, a pacemaker ECG which is not clear should be checked for the presence of arrhythmias (e.g. atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, junctional escape rhythm and endless loop tachycardia), pacemaker malfunction (e.g. atrial or ventricular undersensing or oversensing, atrial or ventricular loss of capture) and activity of specific pacing algorithms, such as automatic mode switching, rate adaptation, AV delay modifying algorithms, reaction to premature ventricular contractions (PVC), safety window pacing, hysteresis and noise mode. CONCLUSION: A systematic analysis of the pacemaker ECG almost always allows a probable diagnosis of arrhythmias and malfunctions to be made, which can be confirmed by pacemaker control and can often be corrected at the touch of the right button to the patient's benefit.

N2  - The present study aimed to compare linear and symbolic dynamics (SD) indices for  detecting the autonomic cardiac changes produced by endotoxemia in freely-moving rats. In this context, we analyzed ECG-derived R-R time series in freely moving Dark Agouti rats, which received lipopolysaccharide (LPS, n = 9), or vehicle (V, n = 7). Five minutes R-R time series were assessed every hour up to +12 h and + 24 h post-LPS injection. We found that SD indices showed significant differences at +7 h between V vs. LPS groups and at +9 h between basal levels of LPS (-3 h) and post-LPS injection (pre-LPS vs. post-LPS). In general, SD seems more appropriate than linear indices to evaluate the autonomic changes of endotoxemic rats. Overall, the symbolic parameters detected decreased R-R variability and complexity, which indicate a modification of the autonomic regulation during LPS-induced endotoxemia. This modification is probably related to a reduced activity of the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway at the long term.

N2  - Problems in measuring the QT-dispersion are associated mostly with the inaccurate  location of the T-wave end. The complications are: (i) In methodology due to various definition for Tend, (ii) In automatic measurements, due to low amplitude of T-wave, presence of U-wave and noise, and (iii) In manual measurements, due to lack of repeatability in the results, and involuntary subjectivism, when the QT-dispersion is measured by a person familiar with the ultimate goal of the study. New ECG repolarization parameter, 'T-Wave Area Dispersion' (TWAD), has been defined by Kenttä et al. 2018. Clustering ability of TWAD for prediction of risk for Sudden Cardiac Death (SCD) has been proven by the authors, working with a large database. We have measured TWAD in peri-, and postoperative ECG recordings of patients, undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting. Analysis of perioperative TWAD has shown an increased risk of adverse events in diabetics. Postoperative TWAD parameters have deteriorated proportionally in both diabetics/ non-diabetics groups indicating increased cardiac risk within the first ten postoperative days. The ability for diabetics/non-diabetics clustering of TWAD has been proven even in case of inaccurate location of the Tend. So far this is a reasonable advantage of TWAD vs. QT-dispersion in the study of ECG repolarization.

N2  - AIM: To develop a statistical index based on the phase space reconstruction (PSR) of  the electrocardiogram (ECG) for the accurate and timely diagnosis of ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation (VF). METHODS: Thirty-two ECGs with sinus rhythm (SR) and 32 ECGs with VT/VF were analyzed using the PSR technique. Firstly, the method of time delay embedding were employed with the insertion of delay "τ" in the original time-series X(t), which produces the Y(t)=X(t-τ). Afterwards, a PSR diagram was reconstructed by plotting Y(t) against X(t). The method of box counting was applied to analyze the behavior of the PSR trajectories. Measures as mean (μ), standard deviation (σ) and coefficient of variation (CV=σ/μ), kurtosis (β) for the box counting of PSR diagrams were reported. RESULTS: During SR, CV was always <0.05, while with the onset of arrhythmia CV increased >0.05. A similar pattern was observed with β, where <6 was considered as the cut-off point between SR and VT/VF. Therefore, the upper threshold for SR was considered CVth=0.05 and βth<6. For optimisation of the accuracy, a new index (J) was proposed: J=wCVCVth+1-wββth. During SR the upper limit of J was the value of 1. Furthermore CV, β and J crossed the cut-off point timely before the onset of arrhythmia (average time: 4min 31s; SD: 2min 30s); allowing sufficient time for preventive therapy. CONCLUSION: The J index improved ECG utility for arrhythmia monitoring and detection utility, allowing the prompt and accurate diagnosis of ventricular arrhythmias.

N2  - BACKGROUND: In-hospital telemetry monitoring is important for diagnosis and  treatment of patients at risk of developing life-threatening arrhythmias. It is widely used in critical and non-critical care wards. Nurses are responsible for correct electrode placement, thus ensuring optimal quality of the monitoring. The aims of this study were to determine whether a complex educational intervention improves (a) optimal electrode placement, (b) hygiene, and (c) delivery of critical information to patients (reason for monitoring, limitations in cellular phone use, and not to leave the ward without informing a member of staff). METHODS: A prospective interventional study design was used, with data collection occurring over two six-week periods: before implementation of the intervention (n=201) and after the intervention (n=165). Standard abstraction forms were used to obtain data on patients' clinical characteristics, and 10 variables related to electrode placement and attachment, hygiene and delivery of critical information. RESULTS: At pre-intervention registration, 26% of the electrodes were misplaced. Twelve per cent of the patients received information about limiting their cellular phone use while monitored, 70% were informed of the purpose of monitoring, and 71% used a protective cover for their unit. Post-intervention, outcome measures for the three variables improved significantly: use of protective cover (p<0.001), information about the purpose of monitoring (p=0.005) and information about limitations in cellular phone use (p=0.003). Nonetheless, 23% of the electrodes were still misplaced. CONCLUSION: The study highlights the need for better, continued education for in-hospital telemetry monitoring in coronary care units, and other units that monitor patients with telemetry.

This paper proposes a novel method to automatically detect TWA based on tensor decomposition methods. APPROACH: Two different tensor decomposition approaches are examined and compared, namely canonical polyadic decomposition and the more generalized variation PARAFAC2 which allows the T waves to shift in time. RESULTS AND SIGNIFICANCE: Results on different artificial and clinical signals show that the presented methods are a robust and reliable way for TWA detection, and show the potential benefit of tensors in ECG signal processing.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Although in-lab polysomnography (PSG) remains the gold standard for  objective sleep monitoring, the use of at-home sensor systems has gained popularity in recent years. Two categories of monitoring, autonomic and limb movement physiology, are increasingly recognized as critical for sleep disorder phenotyping, yet at-home options remain limited outside of research protocols. The purpose of this study was to validate the BiostampRC(®) sensor system for respiration, electrocardiography (ECG), and leg electromyography (EMG) against gold standard PSG recordings. METHODS: We report analysis of cardiac and respiratory data from 15 patients and anterior tibialis (AT) data from 19 patients undergoing clinical PSG for any indication who simultaneously wore BiostampRC(®) sensors on the chest and the bilateral AT muscles. BiostampRC(®) is a flexible, adhesive, wireless sensor capable of capturing accelerometry, ECG, and EMG. We compared BiostampRC(®) data and feature extractions with those obtained from PSG. RESULTS: The heart rate extracted from BiostampRC(®) ECG showed strong agreement with the PSG (cohort root mean square error of 5 beats per minute). We found the thoracic BiostampRC(®) respiratory waveform, derived from its accelerometer, accurately calculated the respiratory rate (mean average error of 0.26 and root mean square error of 1.84 breaths per minute). The AT EMG signal supported periodic limb movement detection, with area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic curve equaling 0.88. Upon completion, 88% of subjects indicated willingness to wear BiostampRC(®) at home on an exit survey. CONCLUSION: The results demonstrate that BiostampRC(®) is a tolerable and accurate method for capturing respiration, ECG, and AT EMG time series signals during overnight sleep when compared with simultaneous PSG recordings. The signal quality sufficiently supports analytics of clinical relevance. Larger longitudinal in-home studies are required to support the role of BiostampRC(®) in clinical management of sleep disorders involving the autonomic nervous system and limb movements.

N2  - The study of short-term cardiovascular interactions is classically performed through  the bivariate analysis of the interactions between the beat-to-beat variability of heart period (RR interval from the ECG) and systolic blood pressure (SBP). Recent progress in the development of multivariate time series analysis methods is making it possible to explore how directed interactions between two signals change in the context of networks including other coupled signals. Exploiting these advances, the present study aims at assessing directional cardiovascular interactions among the basic variability signals of RR, SBP and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), using an approach which allows direct comparison between bivariate and multivariate coupling measures. To this end, we compute information-theoretic measures of the strength and delay of causal interactions between RR, SBP and DBP using both bivariate and trivariate (conditioned) formulations in a group of healthy subjects in a resting state and during stress conditions induced by head-up tilt (HUT) and mental arithmetics (MA). We find that bivariate measures better quantify the overall (direct  +  indirect) information transferred between variables, while trivariate measures better reflect the existence and delay of directed interactions. The main physiological results are: (i) the detection during supine rest of strong interactions along the pathway RR  →  DBP  →  SBP, reflecting marked Windkessel and/or Frank-Starling effects; (ii) the finding of relatively weak baroreflex effects SBP  →  RR at rest; (iii) the invariance of cardiovascular interactions during MA, and the emergence of stronger and faster SBP  →  RR interactions, as well as of weaker RR  →  DBP interactions, during HUT. These findings support the importance of investigating cardiovascular interactions from a network perspective, and suggest the usefulness of directed information measures to assess physiological mechanisms and track their changes across different physiological states.

N2  - This study aims to analyze the autonomic nervous system response during head-up tilt  test (HUTT), by exploring the changes in dynamic properties of heart rate variability in subjects with and without syncopes, to predict the outcome of HUTT. Baroreflex response, as well as linear and non-linear parameters of RR-interval time series, have been extracted from the ECG of 66 subjects: 35 with and 31 without syncope during HUTT. The results show that, when considering the first 15 min of tilting position, the total power spectrum, the standard deviation, the long-term fractal scale of RR-interval and ΔRR-interval of time series increase, while the sample entropy decreases in the positive group compared to the negative one. These indices may be good predictors of positive response in patients with reflex syncope. Additionally, an analysis of the first 15 min of tilting position using kernel support vector machines leads to a correct classification of 85% of patients, within negative and positive response groups (specificity = 80.6% and sensitivity = 88.5%). In medical applications, it is important to avoid false negative diagnosis of syncopes during HUTT. Taking this into account, an overall accuracy of 72.1% can be obtained in the same window allowing the reduction of the examination time in the clinical domain.

N2  - The major aim of this study is to describe a unified procedure for detecting noisy  segments and spikes in transduced signals with a cyclic but non-stationary periodic nature. According to this procedure, the cycles of the signal (onset and offset locations) are detected. Then, the cycles are clustered into a finite number of groups based on appropriate geometrical- and frequency-based time series. Next, the median template of each time series of each cluster is calculated. Afterwards, a correlation-based technique is devised for making a comparison between a test cycle feature and the associated time series of each cluster. Finally, by applying a suitably chosen threshold for the calculated correlation values, a segment is prescribed to be either clean or noisy. As a key merit of this research, the procedure can introduce a decision support for choosing accurately orthogonal-expansion-based filtering or to remove noisy segments. In this paper, the application procedure of the proposed method is comprehensively described by applying it to phonocardiogram (PCG) signals for finding noisy cycles. The database consists of 126 records from several patients of a domestic research station acquired by a 3M Littmann(®) 3200, 4KHz sampling frequency electronic stethoscope. By implementing the noisy segments detection algorithm with this database, a sensitivity of Se=91.41% and a positive predictive value, PPV=92.86% were obtained based on physicians assessments.

N2  - The geometry of the Poincaré plot of RR intervals is considered and its basic  descriptors are defined in terms of the second moment of a distribution of points in a plane. One of the standard descriptors, SD1, is redefined and used to define two new descriptors, SD1(UP) and SD1(DOWN), whose squares partition SD1(2) (the variance corresponding to short-term heart rate variability) into contributions from decelerations and accelerations of heart rate. It is shown that there is a visible and statistically highly significant asymmetry in the Poincaré plot, with the upper part, corresponding to decelerations of heart rate, larger than the lower part, which corresponds to accelerations. The effect is shown in one hundred 30 min long time series of RR intervals derived from the ECG recordings of 100 young (19-32 years old) and healthy adults. After shuffling the data to random order the asymmetry disappears, which shows that this is a genuine physiological phenomenon rather than an artefact of the method.

N2  - The increase in mortality associated with arrhythmia is an inevitable problem of  modern society such as westernized eating habits and an increase in stress due to industrialization, and the related social costs are increasing. In this regard, the supply of automatic external defibrillator (AED) used outside hospitals is increasing mainly in public institutions, and AED is a medical practice performed by non-medical personnel. Therefore, studies on arrhythmia detection algorithm to make accurate clinical judgment for proper use are increasing. In this paper, we propose a time domain analysis method to detect arrhythmia in real time and implement AED by porting it to programmable gate array and digital signal processor. The analysis of the phase domain improves the detection rate of R-peak using the differentiated electrocardiogram (ECG) waveform rather than the existing ECG waveform and makes it easy to distinguish the normal ECG from the arrhythmia signal in the phase domain. The proposed algorithm was verified by simulation using Labview and ModelSim, and it was verified that the proposed algorithm works effectively by performing animal experiments using the implemented AED.

N2  - In an 86-year-old woman who had been treated for sick sinus syndrome, the small  high-frequency current delivered by pacemaker in order to measure the minutes ventilation for utilizing the rate-response mode was transiently over-sensed on the Holter electrocardiogram. Although her pacing system was working appropriately, the numbers of the paced beats on the automatic Holter analysis were undercounted (from >60% to <5%) during the over-sensing periods because these currents were recognized as multiple pacing spikes. Physicians need to pay attention to such multiple pacing spike markers, because these can be a cause of unreliable results of the Holter analysis. <Learning objective: Paying attention to multiple pacing spike markers on Holter electrocardiogram is clinically important in patients treated by a rate-response pacemaker. This is because (1) this does not imply the malfunction of the pacemaker system, and (2) results from automatic Holter analysis would not be reliable during the period when these multiple pacing markers were recorded.>.

N2  - Having in mind the availability of electronic stethoscopes, phonocardiograms (PCGs)  have become popular for cardiovascular functionality monitoring and signal processing applications. Detection of fundamental heart sounds (HSs), S1s and S2s, is considered to be a crucial step in PCG analysis. Electrocardiogram (ECG), noted as a reference signal, is often synchronously recorded in order to simplify the S1/S2 detection process. Nevertheless, electronic stethoscopes are frequently used without additional ECG equipment. We propose a new algorithm for automatic fundamental HSs detection via: joint time-frequency representation based on pseudo affine Wigner-Ville distribution (PAWVD), Haar wavelet lifting scheme (Haar-LS), normalized average Shannon energy (NASE) and autocorrelation. The performance of the proposed algorithm was calculated on both normal (50) and pathological (75) PCG recordings, eight seconds long each, contributed by 125 different pediatric patients. The algorithm showed relatively high recall (90.41%) and precision (96.39%) rates of S1/S2 detection procedure in a variety of PCG signals, without ECG as a reference. Furthermore, it indicated the ability to overcome splitting within the S1/S2 heart sounds.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess the cardioprotective effect of  magnesium sulfate in patients with left ventricular concentric hypertrophy undergoing cardiac surgery. DESIGN: The study was a double-blinded randomized study. SETTING: This study was conducted at a cardiac center. PATIENTS: The study included 250 patients. INTERVENTION: The study included two groups (each = 125): Group M - the patients who received magnesium sulfate infusion (15 mg/kg/h). The infusion was started 20 min before induction, during surgery, and the first postoperative 24 h. Group C - the patients who received an equal amount of normal saline. MEASUREMENTS: The variables included troponin I level, creatinine kinase-MB (CK-MB) level, electrocardiograph (ECG) with automatic ST-segment analysis (leads II and V), E/A peak ratio, end-diastolic volume, cardiac index (CI), heart rate, mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), mean arterial pulmonary pressure (mPAP), pulmonary and systemic vascular resistances, and pharmacological and mechanical support. MAIN RESULTS: The troponin I level, CK-MB, and ECG changes were lower in Group M than Group C (P < 0.05). The E/A peak ratio and end-diastolic volume increased in Group M than Group C (P < 0.05). There was a significant increase in the CI and a decrease in the heart rate, mPAP, pulmonary vascular resistances, and pharmacological and mechanical support in Group M compared to Group C (P < 0.05). There were minimal changes in the MAP and systemic vascular resistance in Group M compared to Group C (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The magnesium sulfate provides a cardioprotective effect in patients with concentric ventricular hypertrophy undergoing cardiac surgery. It decreases the incidence of perioperative myocardial infarction and arrhythmia. Furthermore, it decreases the requirement of pharmacological and mechanical support.

N2  - Continuous and non-invasive monitoring of hemodynamic parameters through unobtrusive  wearable sensors can potentially aid in early detection of cardiac abnormalities, and provides a viable solution for long-term follow-up of patients with chronic cardiovascular diseases without disrupting the daily life activities. Electrocardiogram (ECG) and siesmocardiogram (SCG) signals can be readily acquired from light-weight electrodes and accelerometers respectively, which can be employed to derive systolic time intervals (STI). For this purpose, automated and accurate annotation of the relevant peaks in these signals is required, which is challenging due to the inter-subject morphological variability and noise prone nature of SCG signal. In this paper, an approach is proposed to automatically annotate the desired peaks in SCG signal that are related to STI by utilizing the information of peak detected in the sliding template to narrow-down the search for the desired peak in actual SCG signal. Experimental validation of this approach performed in conventional/controlled supine and realistic/challenging seated conditions, containing over 5600 heart beat cycles shows good performance and robustness of the proposed approach in noisy conditions. Automated measurement of STI in wearable configuration can provide a quantified cardiac health index for long-term monitoring of patients, elderly people at risk and health-enthusiasts.

N2  - This research proposes an augmented magnetic navigation system for Transcatheter  Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI) employing a magnetic tracking system (MTS) combined with a dynamic aortic model and intra-operative ultrasound (US) images. The dynamic 3D aortic model is constructed based on the preoperative 4D computed tomography (CT), which is animated according to the real time electrocardiograph (ECG) input of patient. And a preoperative planning is performed to determine the target position of the aortic valve prosthesis. The temporal alignment is performed to synchronize the ECG signals, intra-operative US image and tracking information. Afterwards, with the assistance of synchronized ECG signals, the contour of aortic root automatic extracted from short axis US image is registered to the dynamic aortic model by a feature based registration intra-operatively. Then the augmented MTS guides the interventionist to confidently position and deploy the aortic valve prosthesis to target. The system was validated by animal studies on three porcine subjects, the deployment and tilting errors of which are 3.17 ± 0.91 mm and 7.40 ± 2.89° respectively.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: West syndrome is an epileptic encephalopathy starting in infancy with  almost continuous interictal epileptic activity, so-called hypsarrhythmia pattern, and therefore is an interesting model for investigating the effect of interictal epileptic activity on autonomic function. It is known that autonomic dysfunction contributes to morbidity and mortality in epilepsy. Our aim is to investigate the effect of interictal epileptic activity in West syndrome on respiratory control. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Interictal single-lead ECG signals were extracted from 24-h video-EEG recordings in 10 children suffering from West syndrome and 14 control subjects. RR interval time series were calculated, and respiration was derived from the ECG signal. ECG-derived respiration (EDR) signals were computed and time and frequency domain parameters were extracted to characterize the respiration pattern. RESULTS: In time domain, the standard deviation of the EDR signal is significantly lower in patients with West syndrome compared to control subjects. This finding is an indication of a less variable respiratory rate. In frequency domain, we analyzed the mean power spectrum for the EDR. In patients with West syndrome, there is more activity at the lower frequencies considered to be a risk factor for apneas. Second, there is an attenuated peak at the higher frequency band where normal respiratory rate is to be found, indicating an abnormal breathing pattern. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that there is a clear dysfunction in autonomic respiratory control in patients with West syndrome, in between the typical ictal epileptic spasms, compared to control subjects. Respiration is more fixed and contains a higher risk of apneas.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this research was to design a delineation algorithm that  could detect specific fiducial points of the seismocardiogram (SCG) signal with or without using the electrocardiogram (ECG) R-wave as the reference point. The detected fiducial points were used to estimate cardiac time intervals. Due to complexity and sensitivity of the SCG signal, the algorithm was designed to robustly discard the low-quality cardiac cycles, which are the ones that contain unrecognizable fiducial points. METHOD: The algorithm was trained on a dataset containing 48,318 manually annotated cardiac cycles. It was then applied to three test datasets: 65 young healthy individuals (dataset 1), 15 individuals above 44 years old (dataset 2), and 25 patients with previous heart conditions (dataset 3). RESULTS: The algorithm accomplished high prediction accuracy with the rootmean- square-error of less than 5 ms for all the test datasets. The algorithm overall mean detection rate per individual recordings (DRI) were 74, 68, and 42 percent for the three test datasets when concurrent ECG and SCG were used. For the standalone SCG case, the mean DRI was 32, 14 and 21 percent. CONCLUSION: When the proposed algorithm applied to concurrent ECG and SCG signals, the desired fiducial points of the SCG signal were successfully estimated with a high detection rate. For the standalone case, however, the algorithm achieved high prediction accuracy and detection rate for only the young individual dataset. SIGNIFICANCE: The presented algorithm could be used for accurate and non-invasive estimation of cardiac time intervals.

N2  - Electrocardiogram (ECG) signal processing and analysis provide crucial information  about functional status of the heart. The QRS complex represents the most important component within the ECG signal. Its detection is the first step of all kinds of automatic feature extraction. QRS detector must be able to detect a large number of different QRS morphologies. This paper examines the use of wavelet detail coefficients for the accurate detection of different QRS morphologies in ECG. Our method is based on the power spectrum of QRS complexes in different energy levels since it differs from normal beats to abnormal ones. This property is used to discriminate between true beats (normal and abnormal) and false beats. Significant performance enhancement is observed when the proposed approach is tested with the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database (MITDB). The obtained results show a sensitivity of 99.64% and a positive predictivity of 99.82%.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is recommended as an important component of  a comprehensive approach to cardiovascular disease (CVD) patients. Data have shown that a small percentage of eligible patients participate in CR despite their well established benefits. Applying telerehabilitation provides an opportunity to improve the implementation of and adherence to CR. The purpose of the study was to evaluate a wide implementation and feasibility of home-based cardiac telerehabilitation (HTCR) in patients suffering from CVD and to assessits safety, patients' acceptance of and adherence to HTCR. METHODS: The study included 365 patients (left ventricular ejection fraction 56 ± 8%; aged 58 ± 10 years). They participated in 4-week HTCR based on walking, nordic walking or cycloergometer training. HTCR was telemonitored with a device adjusted to register electrocardiogram (ECG) recording and to transmit data via mobile phone to the monitoring center. The moments of automatic ECG registration were pre-set and coordinated with CR. The influence on physical capacity was assessed by comparing changes - in time of exercise test, functional capacity, 6-min walking test distance from the beginning and the end of HTCR. At the end of the study, patients filled in a questionnaire in order to assess their acceptance of HTCR. RESULTS: HTCR resulted in a significant improvement in all parameters. There were neither deaths nor adverse events during HTCR. Patients accepted HTCR, including the need for interactive everyday collaboration with the monitoring center. There were only 0.8% non-adherent patients. CONCLUSIONS: HTCR is a feasible, safe form of rehabilitation, well accepted by patients. The adherence to HTCR was high and promising.

N2  - The aim of this study was to determine the minimal sampling rate (SR) required for  blood pressure (BP) waveform recordings to accurately determine BP and heart rate (HR) variability indices and baroreceptor reflex sensitivity in rats and mice. We also determined if an 8-bit (versus 12-bit) analog-to-digital converter (ADC) resolution is sufficient to accurately determine these hemodynamic parameters and if spline interpolation to 1000 Hz of BP waveforms sampled at lower SRs can improve accuracy. BP and ECG recordings (1000 Hz SR, 12-bit ADC resolution) from two strains of rats and BP recordings (1000 Hz SR, 12-bit ADC resolution) from two strains of mice were mathematically converted to lower SRs and/or 8-bit ADC resolution. Time-domain HR variability and frequency-domain HR and BP variability indices and baroreflex sensitivity (using the sequence technique) were determined and the results obtained from the original files were compared to the results obtained from the mathematically altered files. Our results demonstrate that an ADC resolution of 8 bit is not sufficient to determine HR and BP variability in rats and mice and baroreceptor reflex sensitivity in mice. Average values for systolic, mean and diastolic BP and HR can be accurately derived from BP waveforms recorded at a minimal SR of 200 Hz in rats and mice. Spline interpolation of BP waveforms to 1000 Hz prior to extracting derived parameters reduces this minimal SR to 50 Hz in rats but still requires 200 Hz in mice. Frequency-domain BP variability (very low and low frequency spectral powers) can be estimated accurately at a minimum SR of 100 Hz in rats and mice and spline interpolation of BP waveforms to 1000 Hz reduces this minimal SR to 50 Hz in rats but does not reduce the minimal SR in mice. Time- and frequency-domain HR variability parameters require at least a SR of 1000 Hz in rats and mice. Spline interpolation of BP waveforms to 1000 Hz reduces this minimal SR to 100 Hz in rats and to 200 Hz in mice. Estimation of baroreflex sensitivity using the sequence technique requires a SR of at least 1000 Hz in rats and mice. Spline interpolation of BP waveforms to 1000 Hz reduces this minimal SR to 100 Hz in rats but does not reduce the minimum SR in mice. Finally, our results indicate that HR time series derived from BP waveforms are not totally consistent with HR time series derived from the ECG in rats. In conclusion, accurate assessment of HR variability and baroreflex sensitivity from BP waveform recordings requires a SR of at least 1000 Hz in rats and mice. If lower SRs are used for BP waveform recordings, a cubic spline interpolation to 1000 Hz (or an even higher SR) prior to extracting derived parameters significantly improves accuracy.

N2  - Accurate estimation of heart rates from photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals during  intense physical activity is a very challenging problem. This is because strenuous and high intensity exercise can result in severe motion artifacts in PPG signals, making accurate heart rate (HR) estimation difficult. In this study we investigated a novel technique to accurately reconstruct motion-corrupted PPG signals and HR based on time-varying spectral analysis. The algorithm is called Spectral filter algorithm for Motion Artifacts and heart rate reconstruction (SpaMA). The idea is to calculate the power spectral density of both PPG and accelerometer signals for each time shift of a windowed data segment. By comparing time-varying spectra of PPG and accelerometer data, those frequency peaks resulting from motion artifacts can be distinguished from the PPG spectrum. The SpaMA approach was applied to three different datasets and four types of activities: (1) training datasets from the 2015 IEEE Signal Process. Cup Database recorded from 12 subjects while performing treadmill exercise from 1 km/h to 15 km/h; (2) test datasets from the 2015 IEEE Signal Process. Cup Database recorded from 11 subjects while performing forearm and upper arm exercise. (3) Chon Lab dataset including 10 min recordings from 10 subjects during treadmill exercise. The ECG signals from all three datasets provided the reference HRs which were used to determine the accuracy of our SpaMA algorithm. The performance of the SpaMA approach was calculated by computing the mean absolute error between the estimated HR from the PPG and the reference HR from the ECG. The average estimation errors using our method on the first, second and third datasets are 0.89, 1.93 and 1.38 beats/min respectively, while the overall error on all 33 subjects is 1.86 beats/min and the performance on only treadmill experiment datasets (22 subjects) is 1.11 beats/min. Moreover, it was found that dynamics of heart rate variability can be accurately captured using the algorithm where the mean Pearson's correlation coefficient between the power spectral densities of the reference and the reconstructed heart rate time series was found to be 0.98. These results show that the SpaMA method has a potential for PPG-based HR monitoring in wearable devices for fitness tracking and health monitoring during intense physical activities.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Myocardial external efficiency (MEE) is defined as the ratio of kinetic  energy associated with cardiac work [forward cardiac output (FCO)*mean systemic pressure] and the chemical energy from oxygen consumed (MVO(2)) by the left ventricular mass (LVM). We developed a fully automated method for estimating MEE based on a single (11)C-acetate PET scan without ECG-gating. METHODS AND RESULTS: Ten healthy controls, 34 patients with aortic valve stenosis (AVS), and 20 patients with mitral valve regurgitation (MVR) were recruited in a dual-center study. MVO(2) was calculated using washout of (11)C -acetate activity. FCO and LVM were calculated automatically using dynamic PET and parametric image formation. FCO and LVM were also obtained using cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) in all subjects. The correlation between MEE(PET-CMR) and MEE(PET) was high (r = 0.85, P < 0.001) without significant bias. MEE(PET) was 23.6 ± 4.2% for controls and was lowered in AVS (17.2 ± 4.3%, P < 0.001) and in MVR (18.0 ± 5.2%, P = 0.004). MEE(PET) was strongly associated with both NYHA class (P < 0.001) and the magnitude of valvular dysfunction (mean aortic gradient: P < 0.001, regurgitant fraction: P = 0.009). CONCLUSION: A single (11)C-acetate PET yields accurate and automated MEE results on different scanners. MEE might provide an unbiased measurement of the phenotypic response to valvular disease.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Amitraz is a pesticide used worldwide on animals and in agriculture. It  contains triazapentadiene, which is a centrally acting alpha-2 adrenergic agonist. Amitraz poisoning is fairly uncommon in humans and occurs via oral, dermal or inhalational routes. Only a limited number of case reports of human intoxication have been published and most of them are of accidental ingestion by children. CASE PRESENTATION: A twenty-year-old Sri Lankan female presented following self-ingestion of 20 ml of amitraz resulting in 37.8 mg/ kg of amitraz poisoning. She lost consciousness after 20 min of ingestion, developed bradycardia and hypotension, which needed intravenous fluid resuscitation and dobutamine. Gastric lavage was performed. Her bradycardia persisted for 36 h and she was drowsy for 48 h. She did not develop respiratory depression, convulsions or hypothermia and the urine output was normal. Arterial blood gas revealed mild respiratory alkalosis. She recovered fully within 48 h and was discharged on day 3. CONCLUSION: The clinical manifestations of amitraz (impaired consciousness, drowsiness, vomiting, disorientation, miosis, mydriasis, hypotension, bradycardia, respiratory depression, hypothermia, generalized seizures, hyperglycemia and glycosuria) can be explained by the agonist action of amitraz on α1 and α2 receptors. Management of amitraz poisoning is still considered to be supportive and symptomatic with monitoring of nervous system, cardiovascular and respiratory systems. Activated charcoal may still be considered for treatment and the place for gastric lavage is controversial. Atropine is effective for symptomatic bradycardia and inotropic support is needed for hypotension that does not respond to fluid resuscitation. Diazepam or Lorazepam is used for convulsions and some patients may require intubation and ICU care. Several α2 adrenergic antagonists like yohimbine have been tried on animals, which have successfully reversed the effects of amitraz. Since the majority of amitraz poisoning cases are due to accidental ingestion, manufactures, regulatory authorities and national poisons control centers have a significant role to play in minimizing its occurrence.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Anemia is a common health problem worldwide and is associated with a  poor prognosis for cardiovascular diseases. It can alter myocardial depolarization and repolarization by affecting the generation and propagation of electrical impulses. The frontal QRS-T angle is a novel marker of the absolute difference between myocardial depolarization and repolarization. This study investigated the effects of anemia on the frontal QRS-T angle. METHODS: The study included 66 anemic subjects with no cardiac disorders, and 50 age- and gender-matched controls. Twelve-lead electrocardiography (ECG) was obtained for all subjects, and the frontal QRS-T angle was calculated based on the automatic report of the ECG machine. RESULTS: Subjects with anemia had a significantly higher frontal QRS-T angle than subjects without anemia (28.9 ± 14.1 vs. 22.5 ± 11.8, p = 0.011). In correlation analysis, the frontal QRS-T angle was positively correlated with the body mass index (BMI; r = 0.287, p = 0.002), left ventricular mass (LVM; r = 0.264, p = 0.004), and heart rate (r = 0.275, p = 0.003) and negatively correlated with the hemoglobin level (r = -0.349, p < 0.001). Multivariate regression analysis showed that the hemoglobin level (β = -0.254, tβ = -2.805, p = 0.006), BMI (β=0.240, t=2.770, p=0.007), and LVM (β=0.201, t=2.303, p=0.023) were independently associated with the frontal QRS-T angle. CONCLUSIONS: The hemoglobin level was found to be an independent predictor of the frontal QRS-T angle.

N2  - A 44-year-old woman with a history of complicated type 2 diabetes mellitus presented  with a diagnosis of right-hemispheric ischaemic stroke. She developed acute respiratory distress with radiological evidence of pulmonary oedema. The ECG showed poorly significant ST-segment changes, with a minimal increase of cardiac biomarkers. Echocardiography showed a severely depressed left ventricular function, with also low values of cardiac output at invasive monitoring. The possibility of neurogenic-stunned myocardium was discussed and a metabolic resuscitation with high-dose insulin was proposed. An intravenous bolus of 80 units of insulin (0.72 IU/kg) was followed by a continuous infusion at the rate of 160 IU/h (1.45 IU/kg/h). The treatment led to a rapid and sustained improvement of the haemodynamic condition and was well tolerated. In comparison with dobutamine, insulin had significant inotropic effects without tachycardia. The patient unfortunately died on day 35, from respiratory complications after poor neurological recovery.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Guidelines recommend that implantable loop recorders (ILRs) are used in  the evaluation of people with recurrent unexplained syncope in the absence of high-risk criteria, and in high-risk patients after a negative evaluation. The aim of this systematic review was to analyze the diagnostic yield of ILRs in these patients. METHODS: We performed a systematic search in order to retrieve studies enrolling adults undergoing ILR implantation for undetermined syncope. The primary outcome was the overall diagnostic yield, defined as the proportion of patients with syncope recurrence and an available ILR recording or an automatic detection of a significant arrhythmia. Secondary outcomes were the proportions of patients with the specific etiologic diagnoses on the total of subjects and the proportion of an analyzable ECG recording during symptoms. We used a random effects model for the meta-analyses. RESULTS: Forty-nine studies, enrolling 4381 subjects, were included. The overall diagnostic yield was 43.9% (95% CI=40.2%, 47.6%; I(2)=79.8%). The proportions of subjects finally diagnosed with arrhythmic syncope, ventricular arrhythmias, supraventricular arrhythmias and bradyarrhythmias were 26.5%, 2.7%, 4.9% and 18.2%, respectively. The proportion of an analyzable ECG recording during symptoms was 89.5% (95% CI=86.1%, 92.1%; 1236 subjects; 36 studies; I(2)=44.9%). Median time to diagnosis was 134days. Heterogeneity is an important limitation to be acknowledged. CONCLUSIONS: About a half of unexplained syncope subjects implanted with an ILR were diagnosed, and around 50% of them had an arrhythmia. Life-threatening arrhythmias as well as ILR complications and death due to arrhythmic events were very rare.

N2  - The paper presents the system for intelligent analysis of clinical information.  Authors describe methods implemented in the system for clinical information retrieval, intelligent diagnostics of chronic diseases, patient's features importance and for detection of hidden dependencies between features. Results of the experimental evaluation of these methods are also presented. BACKGROUND: Healthcare facilities generate a large flow of both structured and unstructured data which contain important information about patients. Test results are usually retained as structured data but some data is retained in the form of natural language texts (medical history, the results of physical examination, and the results of other examinations, such as ultrasound, ECG or X-ray studies). Many tasks arising in clinical practice can be automated applying methods for intelligent analysis of accumulated structured array and unstructured data that leads to improvement of the healthcare quality. AIMS: the creation of the complex system for intelligent data analysis in the multi-disciplinary pediatric center. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Authors propose methods for information extraction from clinical texts in Russian. The methods are carried out on the basis of deep linguistic analysis. They retrieve terms of diseases, symptoms, areas of the body and drugs. The methods can recognize additional attributes such as "negation" (indicates that the disease is absent), "no patient" (indicates that the disease refers to the patient's family member, but not to the patient), "severity of illness", disease course", "body region to which the disease refers". Authors use a set of hand-drawn templates and various techniques based on machine learning to retrieve information using a medical thesaurus. The extracted information is used to solve the problem of automatic diagnosis of chronic diseases. A machine learning method for classification of patients with similar nosology and the methodfor determining the most informative patients'features are also proposed. RESULTS: Authors have processed anonymized health records from the pediatric center to estimate the proposed methods. The results show the applicability of the information extracted from the texts for solving practical problems. The records ofpatients with allergic, glomerular and rheumatic diseases were used for experimental assessment of the method of automatic diagnostic. Authors have also determined the most appropriate machine learning methods for classification of patients for each group of diseases, as well as the most informative disease signs. It has been found that using additional information extracted from clinical texts, together with structured data helps to improve the quality of diagnosis of chronic diseases. Authors have also obtained pattern combinations of signs of diseases. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed methods have been implemented in the intelligent data processing system for a multidisciplinary pediatric center. The experimental results show the availability of the system to improve the quality of pediatric healthcare.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Repetitive interpolated ventricular bigeminy (RIVB) can introduce a  doubling of the ventricular rate. OBJECTIVE: To clarify the mechanism of RIVB, we hypothesized that it was introduced by a strong modulation of the ventricular automatic focus. METHODS: RIVB, defined as more than 7 bigeminy events, was detected by instantaneous heart rate and bigeminy interval (BI) tachograms in 1450 successive patients with frequent ventricular premature contractions (≥3000 per day). Postextrasystolic interval bigeminy interval curves were plotted to determine the degree of modulation. Mean sinus cycle length bigeminy interval curves were plotted for selection. RIVB was simulated by using a computer-based parasystole model. RESULTS: RIVB was observed in 7 patients (age 60 ± 16 years; 2 men and 5 women) with a heart rate of 58.2 ± 6.5 beats/min during a rest period both during the day and at night. The tachograms disclosed the onset of the RIVB with a doubled ventricular rate to 112.3 ± 8.5 beats/min. On the postextrasystolic interval bigeminy interval curves, compensatory bigeminy and interpolated bigeminy constituted overlapping regression lines with slopes close to 1.00 and RIVB was located in the lower left portion. RIVB lasting for up to 3 hours was quickly detected by mean sinus cycle length bigeminy interval curve. The PQ interval immediately after RIVB was prolonged in comparison with baseline (0.18 ± 0.02 to 0.21 ± 0.02 seconds; P < .001). The simulation was able to reproduce RIVB faithfully at a slow heart rate. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the hypothesis that RIVB was introduced by strongly modulated ventricular pacemaker accelerated by an intervening normal QRS.

N2  - Early detection of tissue hypoxia in the intensive care unit is essential for  effective treatment. Reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) has been suggested to be the most sensitive indicator of tissue oxygenation at the mitochondrial level. However, no experimental evidence comparing the kinetics of changes in NADH and other physiological parameters has been provided. The aim of this study is to obtain the missing data in a systematic and reliable manner. We constructed four acute hypoxia models, including hypoxic hypoxia, hypemic hypoxia, circulatory hypoxia, and histogenous hypoxia, and measured NADH fluorescence, tissue reflectance, cerebral blood flow, respiration, and electrocardiography simultaneously from the induction of hypoxia until death. We found that NADH was not always the first onset parameter responding to hypoxia. The order of responses was mainly affected by the cause of hypoxia. However, NADH reached its alarm level earlier than the other monitored parameters, ranging from several seconds to >10  min. As such, we suggest that the NADH can be used as a hypoxia indicator, although the exact level that should be used must be further investigated. When the NADH alarm is detected, the body still has a chance to recover if appropriate and timely treatment is provided.

N2  - Automatic feature extraction and classification are two main tasks in abnormal ECG  beat recognition. Feature extraction is an important prerequisite prior to classification since it provides the classifier with input features, and the performance of classifier depends significantly on the quality of these features. This study develops an effective method to extract low-dimensional ECG beat feature vectors. It employs wavelet multi-resolution analysis to extract time-frequency domain features and then applies principle component analysis to reduce the dimension of the feature vector. In classification, 12-element feature vectors characterizing six types of beats are used as inputs for one-versus-one support vector machine, which is conducted in form of 10-fold cross validation with beat-based and record-based training schemes. Tested upon a total of 107049 beats from MIT-BIH arrhythmia database, our method has achieved average sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of 99.09%, 99.82% and 99.70%, respectively, using the beat-based training scheme, and 44.40%, 88.88% and 81.47%, respectively, using the record-based training scheme.

N2  - The pre-ejection period (PEP) is a valid index of myocardial contractility and  beta-adrenergic sympathetic control of the heart defined as the time between electrical systole (ECG Q wave) to the initial opening of the aortic valve, estimated as the B point on the impedance cardiogram (ICG). B-point detection accuracy can be severely impacted if ICG cardiac cycles corrupted by motion artifact, noise, or electrode displacement are included in the analyses. Here, we developed new algorithms to detect and exclude corrupted ICG cycles by analyzing their level of activity. PEP was then estimated and analyzed on ensemble-averaged clean ICG cycles using an automatic algorithm previously developed by the authors for the detection of B point in awake individuals. We investigated the algorithms' performance relative to expert visual scoring on long-duration data collected from 20 participants during overnight recordings, where the quality of ICG could be highly affected by movement artifacts and electrode displacements and the signal could also vary according to sleep stage and time of night. The artifact rejection algorithm achieved a high accuracy of 87% in detection of expert-identified corrupted ICG cycles, including those with normal amplitude as well as out-of-range values, and was robust to different types and levels of artifact. Intraclass correlations for concurrent validity of the B-point detection algorithm in different sleep stages and in-bed wakefulness exceeded 0.98, indicating excellent agreement with the expert. The algorithms show promise toward sleep applications requiring accurate and reliable automatic measurement of cardiac hemodynamic parameters.

N2  - Electrical defibrillation is the most effective way to treat the ventricular  tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation (VF). An automatic external defibrillator based on DSP is introduced in this paper. The whole design consists of the signal collection module, the microprocessor controlingl module, the display module, the defibrillation module and the automatic recognition algorithm for VF and non VF, etc. This automatic external defibrillator has achieved goals such as ECG signal real-time acquisition, ECG wave synchronous display, data delivering to U disk and automatic defibrillate when shockable rhythm appears, etc.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) is a common presenting dysrhythmia in the  setting of cardiac arrest whose main treatment is defibrillation through direct current countershock to achieve return of spontaneous circulation. However, often defibrillation is unsuccessful and may even lead to the transition of VF to more nefarious rhythms such as asystole or pulseless electrical activity. Multiple methods have been proposed for predicting defibrillation success based on examination of the VF waveform. To date, however, no analytical technique has been widely accepted. We developed a unique approach of computational VF waveform analysis, with and without addition of the signal of end-tidal carbon dioxide (PetCO2), using advanced machine learning algorithms. We compare these results with those obtained using the Amplitude Spectral Area (AMSA) technique. METHODS: A total of 90 pre-countershock ECG signals were analyzed form an accessible preshosptial cardiac arrest database. A unified predictive model, based on signal processing and machine learning, was developed with time-series and dual-tree complex wavelet transform features. Upon selection of correlated variables, a parametrically optimized support vector machine (SVM) model was trained for predicting outcomes on the test sets. Training and testing was performed with nested 10-fold cross validation and 6-10 features for each test fold. RESULTS: The integrative model performs real-time, short-term (7.8 second) analysis of the Electrocardiogram (ECG). For a total of 90 signals, 34 successful and 56 unsuccessful defibrillations were classified with an average Accuracy and Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 82.2% and 85%, respectively. Incorporation of the end-tidal carbon dioxide signal boosted Accuracy and ROC AUC to 83.3% and 93.8%, respectively, for a smaller dataset containing 48 signals. VF analysis using AMSA resulted in accuracy and ROC AUC of 64.6% and 60.9%, respectively. CONCLUSION: We report the development and first-use of a nontraditional non-linear method of analyzing the VF ECG signal, yielding high predictive accuracies of defibrillation success. Furthermore, incorporation of features from the PetCO2 signal noticeably increased model robustness. These predictive capabilities should further improve with the availability of a larger database.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Guidelines recommend maintaining the heart rate (HR) of acute stroke  patients within physiological limits; data on the frequency and predictors of significant deviations from these limits are scarce. METHODS: Demographical data, stroke risk factors, NIH stroke scale score, lesion size and location, and ECG parameters were prospectively assessed in 256 patients with ischemic stroke. Patients were continuously monitored for at least 24 hours on a certified stroke unit. Tachycardia (HR ≥ 120 bpm) and bradycardia (HR <45 bpm) and cardiac rhythm (sinus rhythm or atrial fibrillation) were documented. We investigated the influence of risk factors on HR disturbances and their respective influence on dependence (modified Rankin Scale ≥ 3 after three months) and mortality. RESULTS: HR ≥ 120 bpm occurred in 39 patients (15%). Stroke severity (larger lesion size/higher NIHSS-score on admission), atrial fibrillation and HR on admission predicted its occurrence. HR <45 bpm occurred in 12 patients (5%) and was predicted by lower HR on admission. Neither HR ≥ 120 nor HR <45 bpm independently predicted poor outcome at three moths. Stroke location had no effect on the occurrence of HR violations. Clinical severity and age remained the only consistent predictors of poor outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Significant tachycardia and bradycardia are frequent phenomena in acute stroke; however they do not independently predict clinical course or outcome. Continuous monitoring allows detecting rhythm disturbances in stroke patients and allows deciding whether urgent medical treatment is necessary.

N2  - In this paper, a model-based Bayesian filtering framework called the "marginalized  particle-extended Kalman filter (MP-EKF) algorithm" is proposed for electrocardiogram (ECG) denoising. This algorithm does not have the extended Kalman filter (EKF) shortcoming in handling non-Gaussian nonstationary situations because of its nonlinear framework. In addition, it has less computational complexity compared with particle filter. This filter improves ECG denoising performance by implementing marginalized particle filter framework while reducing its computational complexity using EKF framework. An automatic particle weighting strategy is also proposed here that controls the reliance of our framework to the acquired measurements. We evaluated the proposed filter on several normal ECGs selected from MIT-BIH normal sinus rhythm database. To do so, artificial white Gaussian and colored noises as well as nonstationary real muscle artifact (MA) noise over a range of low SNRs from 10 to -5 dB were added to these normal ECG segments. The benchmark methods were the EKF and extended Kalman smoother (EKS) algorithms which are the first model-based Bayesian algorithms introduced in the field of ECG denoising. From SNR viewpoint, the experiments showed that in the presence of Gaussian white noise, the proposed framework outperforms the EKF and EKS algorithms in lower input SNRs where the measurements and state model are not reliable. Owing to its nonlinear framework and particle weighting strategy, the proposed algorithm attained better results at all input SNRs in non-Gaussian nonstationary situations (such as presence of pink noise, brown noise, and real MA). In addition, the impact of the proposed filtering method on the distortion of diagnostic features of the ECG was investigated and compared with EKF/EKS methods using an ECG diagnostic distortion measure called the "Multi-Scale Entropy Based Weighted Distortion Measure" or MSEWPRD. The results revealed that our proposed algorithm had the lowest MSEPWRD for all noise types at low input SNRs. Therefore, the morphology and diagnostic information of ECG signals were much better conserved compared with EKF/EKS frameworks, especially in non-Gaussian nonstationary situations.

N2  - QT-RR linear regression consists of two parameters, slope and intercept, and the aim  of this study was to evaluate repolarization dynamics using the QT-RR linear regression slope and intercept relationship during 24-h Holter ECG. This study included 466 healthy subjects (54.6 ± 14.6 years; 200 men and 266 women) and 17 patients with ventricular arrhythmias, consisted of 10 patients with idiopathic ventricular fibrillation (IVF) and 7 patients with torsades de pointes (TDP). QT and RR intervals were measured from ECG waves based on a 15-s averaged ECG during 24-h Holter recording using an automatic QT analyzing system. The QT interval dependence on the RR interval was analyzed using a linear regression line for each subject ([QT] = A[RR] + B; where A is the slope and B is the y-intercept). The slope of the QT-RR regression line in healthy subjects was significantly greater in women than in men (0.185 ± 0.036 vs. 0.161 ± 0.033, p < 0.001) and the intercept was significantly smaller in women than in men (0.229 ± 0.028 vs. 0.240 ± 0.027, p < 0.001). A scatter diagram of the QT-RR regression line slope and intercept among healthy subjects demonstrated a statistically significant negative correlation (B = -0.62A + 0.34, r = -0.79). Distribution of both scatter diagrams of the slope and the intercept of the QT-RR regression line in patients with IVF and TDP was different from healthy subjects (left corner for IVF and upward shift for TDP). The slope and intercept relationship of the QT-RR linear regression line based on 24-h Holter ECG may become a simple useful marker for abnormality of ventricular repolarization dynamics.

N2  - Metabolic syndrome (MetS) has been linked to a higher prevalence of sudden cardiac  death (SCD), but the mechanisms are not well understood. One possible underlying mechanism may be an abnormal modulation of autonomic activity, which can be quantified by analyzing heart rate variability (HRV). Our aim was to investigate the modifications of short-term HRV in an experimental rabbit model during the time-course of MetS development. NZW rabbits were randomly assigned to a control (n = 10) or a MetS group (n = 13), fed 28 weeks with control or high-fat, high-sucrose diets. After anesthesia, a 15-min ECG recording was acquired before diet administration and at weeks 14 and 28. We analyzed short RR time series using time-domain, frequency-domain and nonlinear analyses. A mixed-model factorial ANOVA was used for statistical analysis. Time-domain analysis showed a 52.4% decrease in the standard deviation of heart rate in animals from the MetS group at week 28, but no changes in the rest of parameters. In the frequency domain, we found a 9.7% decrease in the very low frequency and a 380.0% increase of the low frequency bands in MetS animals at week 28, whereas high frequency remained unchanged. Nonlinear analyses showed increased complexity and irregularity of the RR time series in MetS animals.

N2  - Ageing has been associated with changes in cardiac electrophysiology that result in  QT interval prolongation. The effect of age on rate-adaptation dynamics of the QT interval is less well understood. The aim of this study was to assess age-related changes in the temporal relationship between QT and RR interval variability. Resting ECG of 20 young and 20 elderly healthy subjects were analyzed. Beat-to-beat RR and QT interval time series were automatically extracted. Coupling between QT and RR was assessed by means of the QT variability index, coherence in the frequency domain, rate-corrected QT interval, cross-multiscale entropy, information based similarity index and joint symbolic dynamics. In addition to QT interval prolongation (433 ± 31 versus 405 ± 33 ms, p = 0.008), elderly subjects were characterized by a significantly increased QT variability index (-1.26 ± 0.28 versus -1.52 ± 0.22 ms, p < 0.0001), reduced coherence in high (0.11 ± 0.09 versus 0.29 ± 0.14 ms, p = 0.003), and low frequency bands (0.20 ± 0.16 versus 0.49 ± 0.15 ms, p < 0.0001), reduced information domain synchronization index (0.13 ± 0.07 versus 0.19 ± 0.05 ms, p = 0.001) as well as increased entropy and disparity in joint symbolic dynamics of QT and RR interval time series. In conclusion, ageing is associated with decoupling of QT variability from heart rate variability. Complexity analysis in addition to standard metrics may provide additional insight.

N2  - Feature extraction and classification of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals are  necessary for the automatic diagnosis of cardiac diseases. In this study, a novel method based on genetic algorithm-back propagation neural network (GA-BPNN) for classifying ECG signals with feature extraction using wavelet packet decomposition (WPD) is proposed. WPD combined with the statistical method is utilized to extract the effective features of ECG signals. The statistical features of the wavelet packet coefficients are calculated as the feature sets. GA is employed to decrease the dimensions of the feature sets and to optimize the weights and biases of the back propagation neural network (BPNN). Thereafter, the optimized BPNN classifier is applied to classify six types of ECG signals. In addition, an experimental platform is constructed for ECG signal acquisition to supply the ECG data for verifying the effectiveness of the proposed method. The GA-BPNN method with the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database achieved a dimension reduction of nearly 50% and produced good classification results with an accuracy of 97.78%. The experimental results based on the established acquisition platform indicated that the GA-BPNN method achieved a high classification accuracy of 99.33% and could be efficiently applied in the automatic identification of cardiac arrhythmias.

N2  - In this paper, classical time- and frequency-domain variability indexes obtained by  pulse rate variability (PRV) series extracted from video-photoplethysmography signals (vPPG) were compared with heart rate variability (HRV) parameters extracted from ECG signals. The study focuses on the analysis of the changes observed during a rest-to-stand manoeuvre (a mild sympathetic stimulus) performed on 60 young, normal subjects (age: [Formula: see text] years). The objective is to evaluate if video-derived PRV indexes may replace HRV in the assessment of autonomic responses to external stimulation. Video recordings were performed with a GigE Sony XCG-C30C camera and analyzed offline to extract the vPPG signal. A new method based on zero-phase component analysis (ZCA) was employed in combination with a fully-automatic method for detection and tracking of region of interest (ROI) located on the forehead, the cheek and the nose. Results show an overall agreement between time and frequency domain indexes computed on HRV and PRV series. However, some differences exist between resting and standing conditions. During rest, all the indexes computed on HRV and PRV series were not statistically significantly different (p  >  0.05), and showed high correlation (Pearson's r  >  0.90). The agreement decreases during standing, especially for the high-frequency, respiration-related parameters such as RMSSD (r  =  0.75), pNN50 (r  =  0.68) and HF power (r  =  0.76). Finally, the power in the LF band (n.u.) was observed to increase significantly during standing by both HRV ([Formula: see text] versus [Formula: see text] (n.u.); rest versus standing) and PRV ([Formula: see text] versus [Formula: see text](n.u.); rest versus standing) analysis, but such an increase was lower in PRV parameters than that observed by HRV indexes. These results provide evidence that some differences exist between variability indexes extracted from HRV and video-derived PRV, mainly in the HF band during standing. However, despite these differences video-derived PRV indexes were able to evince the autonomic responses expected by the sympathetic stimulation induced by the rest-to-stand manoeuvre.

N2  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Automatic processing and accurate diagnosis of wide  complex tachycardia (WCT) arrhythmia groups using electrocardiogram signals (ECG) remains a challenge. WCT arrhythmia consists of two main groups: ventricular tachycardia (VT) and supraventricular tachycardia with aberrancy (SVT-A). These two groups have similar morphologies in the realm of ECG signals. VT and SVT-A arrhythmias originate from the ventricle and atrium, respectively. Hence, inaccurate diagnosis of SVT-A instead of VT can be fatal. METHODS: In this paper, we present a novel algorithm using dynamic time warping (DTW) to discriminate between VT and SVT-A arrhythmias. This method includes pre-processing, best template search (BTS), and classifier modules. The first module, pre-processing, is responsible for filtering, R-wave detection, and beat detection of ECG signals. The second module, BTS, automatically extracts the minimum possible number of signals as a template from the entire training dataset using an intelligent algorithm. These template signals have the greatest morphological difference, which leads to accurate WCT discrimination. Finally, a 1NN classifier categorizes the test data using DTW distance. RESULTS: Our proposed method was evaluated on an ECG signal database consisting of 171 subjects. The results showed that the proposed algorithm can accurately discriminate between VT, SVT-A, and normal subjects, and appears to be suitable for future use in clinical application. The obtained accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive values were 93.22%, 88.68%, 96.98%, and 90.27%, respectively. CONCLUSION: The presented diagnostic method for discriminating VT and SVT-A, using only one ECG lead, is suitable for future clinical use. It can reduce needless therapeutic interventions and minimize risk for patients.

N2  - Advancements in wireless sensor networks (WSN) technology and miniaturization of  wearable sensors have enabled long-term continuous pervasive biomedical signal monitoring. Wrist-worn photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors have gained popularity given their form factor. However the signal quality suffers due to motion artifacts when used in ambulatory settings, making vital parameter estimation a challenging task. In this paper, we present a novel deep learning framework, BioTranslator, for computing the instantaneous heart rate (IHR), using wrist-worn PPG signals collected during physical activity. Using one-dimensional Convolution-Deconvolution Network, we translate a single channel PPG signal to an electrocardiogram(ECG)-like time series signal, from which relevant R-peak information can be inferred enabling IHR measures. The proposed network configuration was evaluated on 12 subjects of the TROIKA dataset, involved in physical activity. The proposed network identifies 92.8% of R-peaks, besides achieving a mean absolute error of 51±6.3ms with respect to reference ECG-derived IHR.

N2  - We investigated cardio-respiratory coupling in patients with heart failure by  quantification of bidirectional interactions between cardiac (RR intervals) and respiratory signals with complementary measures of time series analysis. Heart failure patients were divided into three groups of twenty, age and gender matched, subjects: with sinus rhythm (HF-Sin), with sinus rhythm and ventricular extrasystoles (HF-VES), and with permanent atrial fibrillation (HF-AF). We included patients with indication for implantation of implantable cardioverter defibrillator or cardiac resynchronization therapy device. ECG and respiratory signals were simultaneously acquired during 20 min in supine position at spontaneous breathing frequency in 20 healthy control subjects and in patients before device implantation. We used coherence, Granger causality and cross-sample entropy analysis as complementary measures of bidirectional interactions between RR intervals and respiratory rhythm. In heart failure patients with arrhythmias (HF-VES and HF-AF) there is no coherence between signals (p < 0.01), while in HF-Sin it is reduced (p < 0.05), compared with control subjects. In all heart failure groups causality between signals is diminished, but with significantly stronger causality of RR signal in respiratory signal in HF-VES. Cross-sample entropy analysis revealed the strongest synchrony between respiratory and RR signal in HF-VES group. Beside respiratory sinus arrhythmia there is another type of cardio-respiratory interaction based on the synchrony between cardiac and respiratory rhythm. Both of them are altered in heart failure patients. Respiratory sinus arrhythmia is reduced in HF-Sin patients and vanished in heart failure patients with arrhythmias. Contrary, in HF-Sin and HF-VES groups, synchrony increased, probably as consequence of some dominant neural compensatory mechanisms. The coupling of cardiac and respiratory rhythm in heart failure patients varies depending on the presence of atrial/ventricular arrhythmias and it could be revealed by complementary methods of time series analysis.

N2  - An automatic algorithm for processing simultaneously acquired electrocardiogram  (ECG) and oximetry signals that identifies epochs of pure central apnoea, epochs containing obstructive apnoea and epochs of normal breathing is presented. The algorithm uses time and spectral features from the ECG derived heart-rate and respiration information, as well as features capturing desaturations from the oximeter sensor. Evaluation of performance of the system was achieved by using leave-one-record-out cross validation on the St. Vincent's University Hospital / University College Dublin Sleep Apnea Database from the Physionet collections of recorded physiologic signals. When classifying the three epoch types, our system achieved a specificity of 80%, a sensitivity to central apnoea of 44% and sensitivity to obstructive apnoea of 35%. A sensitivity of 81% was achieved when the central and obstructive epochs were combined into one class.

N2  - Robust and exact automatic P wave detection and delineation in the electrocardiogram  (ECG) is still an interesting but challenging research topic. The early prognosis of cardiac afflictions such as atrial fibrillation and the response of a patient to a given treatment is believed to improve if the P wave is carefully analyzed during sinus rhythm. Manual annotation of the signals is a tedious and subjective task. Its correctness depends on the experience of the annotator, quality of the signal, and ECG lead. In this work, we present a wavelet-based algorithm to detect and delineate P waves in individual ECG leads. We evaluated a large group of commonly used wavelets and frequency bands (wavelet levels) and introduced a special phase free wavelet transformation. The local extrema of the transformed signals are directly related to the delineating points of the P wave. First, the algorithm was studied using synthetic signals. Then, the optimal parameter configuration was found using intracardiac electrograms and surface ECGs measured simultaneously. The reverse biorthogonal wavelet 3.3 was found to be optimal for this application. In the end, the method was validated using the QT database from PhysioNet. We showed that the algorithm works more accurately and more robustly than other methods presented in literature. The validation study delivered an average delineation error of the P wave onset of -0.32±12.41 ms when compared to manual annotations. In conclusion, the algorithm is suitable for handling varying P wave shapes and low signal-to-noise ratios.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: The symptoms of orthostatic hypotension may be ignored or go unnoticed  and may predispose some diabetic or elderly people to repeated falls and trauma, leading to immobility and prolongation of rehabilitation. The present investigation is concerned mainly with testing the reaction of the cardiovascular system in response to physiological stimuli, such as, standing upright from a supine position before and after meal intake in diabetic patients and the healthy Saudi population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy-five healthy and 49 diabetic patients were selected for this study. Parameters of heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, and electrocardiograms (ECG) were obtained for each subject by Dinamap (an automatic recorder), after 10 minutes of rest in the supine position and then after one and two minutes of standing. All parameters were taken before and after an intake of a standard meal. The results were compared between the diabetic and non-diabetic groups, and between the elderly diabetic and the healthy elderly ≥ 65 year olds, and between the young adults ≤ 40 year olds and the elderly ≥ 65 year olds. RESULTS: The postural changes of blood pressure and heart rate between the diabetic and non-diabetic groups, and between the elderly diabetic and the healthy elderly groups, were not significant. However, a highly significant postural drop in blood pressure, and an increase in the resting heart rate were recorded before and after a meal intake in the elderly compared to the young adults. CONCLUSION: The highly significant postural drop in blood pressure and increase in the resting heart rate in the elderly diabetic and healthy elderly people can be attributed to a defect in the arterial baroreceptors control of blood pressure and parasympathetic control of heart rate in this population.

N2  - This paper presents automatic detection and localization of myocardial infarction  (MI) using K-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier. Time domain features of each beat in the ECG signal such as T wave amplitude, Q wave and ST level deviation, which are indicative of MI, are extracted from 12 leads ECG. Detection of MI aims to classify normal subjects without myocardial infarction and subjects suffering from Myocardial Infarction. For further investigation, Localization of MI is done to specify the region of infarction of the heart. Total 20,160 ECG beats from PTB database available on Physio-bank is used to investigate the performance of extracted features with KNN classifier. In the case of MI detection, sensitivity and specificity of KNN is found to be 99.9% using half of the randomly selected beats as training set and rest of the beats for testing. Moreover, Arif-Fayyaz pruning algorithm is used to prune the data which will reduce the storage requirement and computational cost of search. After pruning, sensitivity and specificity are dropped to 97% and 99.6% respectively but training is reduced by 93%. Myocardial Infarction beats are divided into ten classes based on the location of the infarction along with one class of normal subjects. Sensitivity and Specificity of above 90% is achieved for all eleven classes with overall classification accuracy of 98.8%. Some of the ECG beats are misclassified but interestingly these are misclassified to those classes whose location of infarction is near to the true classes of the ECG beats. Pruning is done on the training set for eleven classes and training set is reduced by 70% and overall classification accuracy of 98.3% is achieved. The proposed method due to its simplicity and high accuracy over the PTB database can be very helpful in correct diagnosis of MI in a practical scenario.

N2  - An electrocardiogram (ECG) measures the electric activity of the heart and has been  widely used for detecting heart diseases due to its simplicity and non-invasive nature. By analyzing the electrical signal of each heartbeat, i.e., the combination of action impulse waveforms produced by different specialized cardiac tissues found in the heart, it is possible to detect some of its abnormalities. In the last decades, several works were developed to produce automatic ECG-based heartbeat classification methods. In this work, we survey the current state-of-the-art methods of ECG-based automated abnormalities heartbeat classification by presenting the ECG signal preprocessing, the heartbeat segmentation techniques, the feature description methods and the learning algorithms used. In addition, we describe some of the databases used for evaluation of methods indicated by a well-known standard developed by the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) and described in ANSI/AAMI EC57:1998/(R)2008 (ANSI/AAMI, 2008). Finally, we discuss limitations and drawbacks of the methods in the literature presenting concluding remarks and future challenges, and also we propose an evaluation process workflow to guide authors in future works.

N2  - BACKGROUND: A fraction of routine resting ECG's are taken with electrode positions  interchanged, leading to possible clinical misinterpretation. OBJECTIVE: Develop and test a method to detect and prevent electrode reversals at the electrocardiograph before the ECG is acquired. METHOD: The algorithm is based on QRS axis and P amplitudes for limb electrode reversals, and P-Q-RS amplitude distances to detect chest electrode reversals. The evaluation method involved a large (>18,000) hospital database for which serial ECG's were available and was based on simulated juxtapositions. RESULTS: The 7 most common lead reversals could be detected with a specificity of 99.8% per type and an average sensitivity of 90%, excluding LA-LL reversal (22% sensitivity). DISCUSSION: Results are similar to retrospective studies that used smaller, more homogeneous datasets. CONCLUSION: The early warning system reduces the ECG's recorded with reversal by 80%, at the price of a modest false alert rate of 1.4%.

N2  - We assessed ECGs recorded during home-based telemonitored cardiac rehabilitation  (HTCR) in stable patients with heart-failure. The study included 75 patients with heart failure (NYHA II, III), with a mean age of 56 years. They participated in an eight-week programme of home cardiac rehabilitation which was telemonitored with a device which recorded 16-s fragments of their ECG. These fragments were transmitted via mobile phone to a monitoring centre. The times of the automatic ECG recordings were pre-set and coordinated with the cardiac rehabilitation. Patients were able to make additional recordings when they felt unwell using a tele-event-Holter ECG facility. During the study, 5757 HTCR sessions were recorded and 11,534 transmitted ECG fragments were evaluated. Most ECGs originated from the automatic recordings. Singular supraventricular and ventricular premature beats and ventricular couplets were detected in 16%, 69% and 16% of patients, respectively. Twenty ECGs were recorded when patients felt unwell: non sustained ventricular tachycardia occurred in three patients and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation episode in two patients. Heart failure patients undergoing HTCR did not develop any arrhythmia which required a change of the procedure, confirming it was safe. Cardiac rehabilitation at home was improved by utilizing the tele-event-Holter ECG facility.

N2  - AIMS: In order to improve the electrocardiographic (ECG) diagnosis of arrhythmogenic  right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC), we evaluated novel quantitative parameters of the QRS complex and the value of bipolar chest leads (CF leads) computed from the standard 12 leads. METHODS AND RESULTS: We analysed digital 12-lead ECGs in 44 patients with ARVC, 276 healthy subjects including 44 age and sex-matched with the patients and 36 genotyped members of ARVC families. The length and area of the terminal S wave in V1 to V3 were measured automatically using a common for all 12 leads QRS end. T wave negativity was assessed in V1 to V6 and in the bipolar CF leads computed from the standard 12 leads. The length and area of the terminal S wave were significantly shorter, whereas the S wave duration was significantly longer in ARVC patients compared with matched controls. Among members of ARVC families, those with mutations (n = 15) had shorter QRS length in V2 and V3 and smaller QRS area in lead V2 compared with those without mutations (n = 20). In ARVC patients, the CF leads were diagnostically superior to the standard unipolar precordial leads. Terminal S wave duration in V1 >48 ms or major T wave negativity in CF leads separated ARVC patients from matched controls with 90% sensitivity and 86% specificity. CONCLUSION: The terminal S wave length and area in the right precordial leads are diagnostically useful and suitable for automatic analysis in ARVC. The CF leads are diagnostically superior to the unipolar precordial leads.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Nosocomial infections caused by multidrug-resistant organisms are  commonly associated with longer hospital stays up to 12 to 18 days and annual estimated costs of $5.7 billion to $6.8 billion. One common mode of transmission is cross-contamination between patients and providers via surface contaminants on devices such as telemetry systems. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effect of a cleaning protocol on colonization of surface contaminants on electrocardiographic telemetry systems in 4 cardiovascular step-down units and to compare colonization in medical vs surgical units. METHODS: A prospective, randomized, case-controlled study (the Descriptive Evaluation of Electrocardiographic Telemetry Pathogens [DEET] study) was designed to evaluate microbial colonization on telemetry systems before and after cleaning with sodium hypochlorite wipes. Each randomly selected telemetry system served as its own control. Nurses used a standardized culture technique recommended by personnel in infection control. Colonization before and after cleaning was analyzed by using the McNemar test and frequency tables. A standard cost-comparison analysis was conducted. RESULTS: A total of 30 telemetry systems in medical units and 29 in surgical units were evaluated; 41 telemetry systems (69%) were colonized before the intervention, and 14 (24%) were colonized after it (P < .001). Before cleaning, surface organisms were present in 14 instances (35%) in surgical units and in 27 instances (66%) in medical units (P < .001). The cleaning strategy was cost-effective. CONCLUSIONS: The cleaning intervention was effective, and cost-comparison analysis supported implementing a cleaning strategy for reusable leads rather than investing in disposable leads.

N2  - This study proposes a new method, equal frequency in amplitude and equal width in  time (EFiA-EWiT) discretization, to discriminate between congestive heart failure (CHF) and normal sinus rhythm (NSR) patterns in ECG signals. The ECG unit pattern concept was introduced to represent the standard RR interval, and our method extracted certain features from the unit patterns to classify by a primitive classifier. The proposed method was tested on two classification experiments by using ECG records in Physiobank databases and the results were compared to those from several previous studies. In the first experiment, an off-line classification was performed with unit patterns selected from long ECG segments. The method was also used to detect CHF by real-time ECG waveform analysis. In addition to demonstrating the success of the proposed method, the results showed that some unit patterns in a long ECG segment from a heart patient were more suggestive of disease than the others. These results indicate that the proposed approach merits additional research.

N2  - Our ability to directly monitor the mechanisms that govern cellular function, oxygen  use, and survival is minimal. Therefore, in critically ill children, surrogate markers are used to try to detect evolving or established hypoxia. These surrogate markers are best used in combination and are complementary to clinical examination. Regardless of resource limitations, we propose that the availability of certain monitoring tools form a standard of care without which pediatric cardiac critical care cannot be safely or optimally provided. These tools include standard invasive hemodynamic monitoring with electrocardiography, lactate measurement, central venous oxygen saturation, and echocardiography. Ultimately, monitoring is only useful when the clinician observes a specific value or trend and has the expertise to act appropriately.

N2  - Interest in the effects of drugs on the heart rate-corrected JTpeak (JTpc) interval  from the body-surface ECG has spawned an increasing number of scientific investigations in the field of regulatory sciences, and more specifically in the context of the Comprehensive in vitro Proarrhythmia Assay (CiPA) initiative. We conducted a novel initiative to evaluate the role of automatic JTpc measurement technologies by comparing their ability to distinguish multi- from single-channel blocking drugs. A set of 5232 ECGs was shared by the FDA (through the Telemetric and Holter ECG Warehouse) with 3 ECG device companies (AMPS, Mortara, and Philips). We evaluated the differences in drug-concentration effects on these measurements between the commercial and the FDA technologies. We provide a description of the drug-induced placebo-corrected changes from baseline for dofetilide, quinidine, ranolazine, and verapamil, and discuss the various differences across all technologies. The results revealed only small differences between measurement technologies evaluated in this study. It also confirms that, in this dataset, the JTpc interval distinguishes between multi- and single-channel (hERG) blocking drugs when evaluating the effects of dofetilide, quinidine, ranolazine, and verapamil. However, in the case of quinidine and dofetilide, we noticed a poor consistency across technologies because of the lack of standard definitions for the location of the peak of the T-wave (T-apex) when the T-wave morphology is abnormal.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The autonomic behavior of growth-restricted fetuses at different  evolving hemodynamic stages has not been fully elicited. AIM: To analyze the respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) of growth-restricted fetuses that despite this severe condition show normal Doppler hemodynamics. SUBJECTS: 10 growth-restricted fetuses (FGR group) with normal arterial pulsatility indices (umbilical, uterine, middle cerebral, ductus venosus and aortic isthmus), and 10 healthy fetuses (Control group), 32-37weeks of gestation. METHOD: B-mode ultrasound images for visualizing fetal breathing movements (FBM) or breathing akinesis (FBA), and the simultaneous RR-interval time series from maternal abdominal ECG recordings were obtained. The root-mean-square of successive differences of RR-intervals (RMSSD) was considered as a RSA-related parameter among the instantaneous amplitude of the high-frequency component (AMPHF) and its corresponding instantaneous frequency (IFHF), both computed by using empirical mode decomposition. Mean fetal heart-periods and RSA-related parameters were assessed during episodes of FBM and FBA in 30s length windows. RESULTS: FGR and Control groups presented RSA-related fluctuations during FBM and FBA. Also, both groups showed significant higher (p<0.001) values for the mean heart-period, RMSSD and AMPHF during FBM. No-significant differences (p>0.05) were found for the IFHF regardless of breathing activity (FBM vs. FBA). CONCLUSION: Growth-restricted fetuses without evident hemodynamic compromise exhibit a preserved autonomic cardiovascular regulation, characterized by higher values of RSA and mean heart-period in the presence of FBM. This physiological response reflects a compensatory strategy that may contribute to preserve blood flow redistribution to vital organs.

N2  - In 9 students the ECG, the respirogram, the EOG, the auditomotor and optomotor  reaction times, and the reproduction of 10-digit numbers from the immediate memory (repeated at intervals of 15 sec) were investigated in 25 experiments of 20 min prior to and following p.o. application of 7.5-10 mg diazepam. The autocorrelation function and the power spectrum from about 200 time series were computed, and the frequencies found were verified in the range from 0.2-2.0 min-1. From all possible digit number relations of frequencies (restricted by definite criteria) between the investigated physiological oscillations, the portion of realized synchronizations was calculated as the degree of coupling. The minute-rhythmic coupling degree was found to increase significantly from 41 to 59 per cent under acute influence of diazepam. The heart rate, the respiratory rate and the reaction times did not change significantly. The immediate reproduction power proved significantly diminished. The results are discussed in regard to the facilitated rhythmic synchronization connected with an anxiolytic tranquilizing and sedative-hypmotic action of diazepam.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: As delirium in critically ill children is increasingly recognized, more  children are treated with the antipsychotic drug haloperidol, while current dosing guidelines are lacking solid evidence and appear to be associated with a high risk of adverse events. We aim to report on the safety and efficacy of a recently implemented clinical dose-titration protocol with active monitoring of adverse events. DESIGN: From July 2014 until June 2015, when a potential delirium was identified by regular delirium scores and confirmed by a child psychiatrist, haloperidol was prescribed according to the Dutch Pediatric Formulary. Daily, adverse events were systematically assessed, haloperidol plasma concentrations were measured, and delirium symptoms followed. Dependent on the clinical response, plasma concentration, and adverse event, the dose was adjusted. SETTING: A 28-bed tertiary PICU in the Netherlands. PATIENTS: All patients admitted to the PICU diagnosed with delirium. INTERVENTION: Treatment with haloperidol according to a dose-titration protocol MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS:: Thirteen children (median age [range] 8.3 yr [0.4-13.8 yr]) received haloperidol, predominantly IV (median dose [range] 0.027 mg/kg/d [0.005-0.085 mg/kg/d]). In all patients, pediatric delirium resolved, but five of 13 patients developed possible adverse event. These were reversed after biperiden (n = 2), discontinuing (n = 3), and/or lowering the dose (n = 3). Plasma concentrations were all below the presumed therapeutic threshold of 3-12 µg/L. CONCLUSIONS: Prospective systematic monitoring of adverse event in critically ill children receiving haloperidol revealed a significant proportion of possible adverse events. Adverse event developed despite low plasma concentrations and recommended dose administration in the majority of the patients. Our data suggest that haloperidol can potentially improve pediatric delirium, but it might also put patients at risk for developing adverse events.

N2  - BACKGROUND: heart rate variability (HRV) is a noninvasive diagnostic method used in  the assessment of the autonomic modulation of the heart. The assessment of HRV using nonlinear dynamics methods in the preoperative period of surgical myocardial revascularization could be predictive of morbidity such as pulmonary infections in the postoperative period. OBJECTIVE: to evaluate the behavior of HRV using nonlinear dynamics in the preoperative period of surgical myocardial revascularization and its relation to the occurrence of pulmonary infections in the in-hospital postoperative period. METHODS: a total of 69 patients with coronary artery disease (mean age of 58.6 ± 10.4 years) and indication for elective surgical myocardial revascularization were studied. In order to quantify the nonlinear dynamics of HRV, the following procedures were performed: detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA); analysis of the short (α1) and long-term (α2) components of DFA; approximate entropy (ApEn); Lyapunov exponent (LE); and Hurst exponent (HE) of time series of RR intervals of the ECG, as captured by the Polar S810i instrument on the day before surgery. RESULTS: at the cut-off levels set by the ROC curve, there was a significant difference between the groups with and without pulmonary infections in the postoperative period of myocardial revascularization for total DFA, approximate entropy and Lyapunov exponent with p = 0. 0309, p = 0.0307 and p = 0.0006, respectively. CONCLUSION: the nonlinear dynamics methods, at their respective cut-off levels, allowed for the identification of patients developing pulmonary infection in the postoperative period of surgical myocardial revascularization, thus suggesting that these methods may have a prognostic value for this group of patients.

N2  - Differential privacy concepts have been successfully used to protect anonymity of  individuals in population-scale analysis. Sharing of mobile sensor data, especially physiological data, raise different privacy challenges, that of protecting private behaviors that can be revealed from time series of sensor data. Existing privacy mechanisms rely on noise addition and data perturbation. But the accuracy requirement on inferences drawn from physiological data, together with well-established limits within which these data values occur, render traditional privacy mechanisms inapplicable. In this work, we define a new behavioral privacy metric based on differential privacy and propose a novel data substitution mechanism to protect behavioral privacy. We evaluate the efficacy of our scheme using 660 hours of ECG, respiration, and activity data collected from 43 participants and demonstrate that it is possible to retain meaningful utility, in terms of inference accuracy (90%), while simultaneously preserving the privacy of sensitive behaviors.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Delay in defibrillation (more than 2 min) is associated with worse  survival in patients with a cardiac arrest because of ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia in intensive care units and inpatient wards. METHODS: We tested the relationship between delayed defibrillation and survival from intraoperative or periprocedural cardiac arrest, adjusting for baseline patient characteristics. The analysis was based on data from 865 patients who had intraoperative or periprocedural cardiac arrest caused by ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia in 259 hospitals participating in the National Registry of Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation. RESULTS: The median time to defibrillation was less than 1 min (interquartile range, <1 to 1 min). Delays in defibrillation occurred in 119 patients (13.8%). Characteristics associated with delayed defibrillation included pulseless ventricular tachycardia and noncardiac admitting diagnosis. The association between delayed defibrillation and survival to hospital discharge differed for periprocedural and intraoperative cardiac arrests (P value for interaction = 0.003). For patients arresting outside the operating room, delayed defibrillation was associated with a lower probability of surviving to hospital discharge (31.6% vs. 62.1%, adjusted odds ratio 0.49; 95% CI 0.27, 0.88; P = 0.018). In contrast, delayed defibrillation was not associated with survival for cardiac arrests in the operating room (46.8% vs. 39.6%, adjusted odds ratio 1.23, 95% CI 0.70, 2.19, P = 0.47). CONCLUSIONS: Delays in defibrillation occurred in one of seven cardiac arrests in the intraoperative and periprocedural arenas. Although delayed defibrillation was associated with lower rates of survival after cardiac arrests in periprocedural areas, there was no association with survival for cardiac arrests in the operating room.

N2  - Automatic computer-based seizure detection and warning devices are important for  objective seizure documentation, for SUDEP prevention, to avoid seizure related injuries and social embarrassments as a consequence of seizures, and to develop on demand epilepsy therapies. Automatic seizure detection systems can be based on direct analysis of epileptiform discharges on scalp-EEG or intracranial EEG, on the detection of motor manifestations of epileptic seizures using surface electromyography (sEMG), accelerometry (ACM), video detection systems and mattress sensors and finally on the assessment of changes of physiologic parameters accompanying epileptic seizures measured by electrocardiography (ECG), respiratory monitors, pulse oximetry, surface temperature sensors, and electrodermal activity. Here we review automatic seizure detection based on scalp-EEG, ECG, and sEMG. Different seizure types affect preferentially different measurement parameters. While EEG changes accompany all types of seizures, sEMG and ACM are suitable mainly for detection of seizures with major motor manifestations. Therefore, seizure detection can be optimized by multimodal systems combining several measurement parameters. While most systems provide sensitivities over 70%, specificity expressed as false alarm rates still needs to be improved. Patients' acceptance and comfort of a specific device are of critical importance for its long-term application in a meaningful clinical way.

N2  - Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia encountered in  clinical practice. Radiofrequency catheter ablation (CA) is becoming one of the most widely employed therapies. Yet selection of patients who will benefit from this treatment remains a challenging task. Previous works have examined several electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters as potential predictors of CA success, such as fibrillatory wave (f-wave) amplitude. However, they require a manual computation and consider only a subset of electrodes, so inter-lead spatial variability of the 12-lead ECG is not fully exploited. The present study puts forward an automatic procedure for f-wave amplitude computation to non-invasively predict CA outcome. An extension of this quantitative measure to the whole set of leads is also proposed, based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA). We show that exploiting the spatial diversity present in the surface ECG not only improves the robustness to electrode selection but also increases the predictive power of the amplitude parameter.

N2  - Electrocardiogram (ECG) detection is a routine and effective cardiac problem  detection project. Traditional electrocardiogram detection has limitations in cardiac arrhythmia and other heart disease detection and diagnosis, such as effectiveness, real-time and so on. Based on the advanced mobile networking and wearable design concept, this paper designs and implements a dynamic ECG real-time monitoring system with low power embedded system and Bluetooth 4.0 wireless communication. Its main functions include 24-hour dynamic ECG signal real-time acquisition, processing, wireless communication, display and storage, real-time analysis of typical arrhythmia, recording and alarm, professional doctors real-time reading and diagnosis, dynamic ECG sharing and cloud platform automatic analysis and diagnosis. Both the physiological signal generator and the actual patient's wear test showed that the design and function of the wearable dynamic ECG real-time monitoring terminal based on the mobile networking could meet and apply to the patients with cardiac monitoring needs in the house, hospital, nursing home, outdoor and many other places.

N2  - Electrocardiogram (ECG), which is a noninvasive technique, is used generally as a  primary diagnostic tool for cardiovascular diseases. In real-time scenario, noises like channel noise, muscle artifacts, electrode motion and baseline wander are often embedded with ECG signals during acquisition and transmission. In this paper, an automatic ECG signal enhancement technique is proposed to remove noise components from time-frequency domain represented noisy ECG signal. Stockwell transform (S-Transform) is used in this work to represent the noisy ECG signal in time-frequency domain. Next, masking and filtering technique is applied to remove unwanted noise components from time-frequency domain. The proposed technique does not require any prior information like R-peak position or reference signal as auxiliary signal. This method is evaluated on ECG signals which are available in MIT-BIH Arrhythmia database. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method shows better signal to noise ratio (SNR) and lower root means square error (RMSE) compared to earlier reported wavelet transform with soft thresholding (WT-Soft) and wavelet transform with subband dependent threshold (WT-Subband) based technique. To quantify the significant difference among all methods, the performances of different ECG enhancement techniques at 1.25dB input SNR level are compared using analysis of variance (ANOVA) based statistical evaluation technique and it is seen that the proposed method yields superior performance compared to other methods. R-peak detection test is also conducted on enhanced ECG signal in addition to SNR and RMSE to evaluate the quality of biology-related information preserved in the enhanced ECG signal. The performance of R-peak detection for denoised ECG signals, in terms of sensitivity and positive predictivity using proposed enhancement method, is also better than WT-Soft, WT-Subband methods, and validates the superiority of the proposed method.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: The dynamics of cardiovascular variables are modulated by respiration.  The aim of this study was to assess baroreflex function in normal subjects based on the joint symbolic dynamics of heart rate, blood pressure and respiration. METHODS: ECG, continuous blood pressure and respiration were recorded in ten healthy subjects during rest in the supine position and upon standing. Beat-to-beat time series of heart rate, systolic blood pressure and respiratory phase were extracted and transformed into binary symbol sequences. Words of length two that were reflective of baroreflex activity were statistically analysed with respect to the respiratory phase. RESULTS: Symbolic analysis showed a significant influence of the respiratory phase on the occurrence of baroreflex patterns. Upon standing, the frequency of baroreflex words increased and the effect of respiration appeared to be reduced. CONCLUSIONS: Symbolic dynamics provide a simple representation of cardiovascular dynamics and may be useful for assessing baroreflex function.

N2  - In this paper, the possibility of using the ECG signal as an unequivocal biometric  marker for authentication and identification purposes has been presented. Furthermore, since the ECG signal was acquired from 4 sources using different measurement equipment, electrodes positioning and number of patients as well as the duration of the ECG record acquisition, we have additionally provided an estimation of the extent of information available in the ECG record. To provide a more objective assessment of the credibility of the identification method, some selected machine learning algorithms were used in two combinations: with and without compression. The results that we have obtained confirm that the ECG signal can be acclaimed as a valid biometric marker that is very robust to hardware variations, noise and artifacts presence, that is stable over time and that is scalable across quite a solid (~100) number of users. Our experiments indicate that the most promising algorithms for ECG identification are LDA, KNN and MLP algorithms. Moreover, our results show that PCA compression, used as part of data preprocessing, does not only bring any noticeable benefits but in some cases might even reduce accuracy.

N2  - Chronic stress is the main cause of health problems in high-risk jobs. Wearable  sensors can become an ecologically valid method of stress level assessment in real-life applications. We sought to determine a non-invasive technique for objective stress monitoring. Data were collected from firefighters during 24-h shifts using sensor belts equipped with a dry-lead electrocardiograph (ECG) and a three-axial accelerometer. Levels of stress experienced during fire incidents were evaluated via a brief self-assessment questionnaire. Types of physical activity were distinguished basing on accelerometer readings, and heart rate variability (HRV) time series were segmented accordingly into corresponding fragments. Those segments were classified as stress/no-stress conditions. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis showed true positive classification as stress condition for 15% of incidents (while maintaining almost zero False Positive Rate), which parallels the amount of truly stressful incidents reported in the questionnaires. These results show a firm correspondence between the perceived stress level and physiological data. Psychophysiological measurements are reliable indicators of stress even in ecological settings and appear promising for chronic stress monitoring in high-risk jobs, such as firefighting.

N2  - The analysis and interpretation of physiological signals acquired non-invasively are  increasingly important in Smart Health, precision medicine, and medical research. However, this analysis is hampered due to the length, complexity, and inter-subject variation of these signals, and, consequently, dimensionality reduction and clustering offer substantial benefits. Machine learning, used widely in biomedicine, is increasingly being applied to physiological time series. Among the applications of unsupervised learning, clustering is one of the most important. In this paper, an unsupervised autoen-coder architecture, deep convolutional embedded clustering, is presented as a data-driven approach to study time-frequency characteristics of heart rate variability records. An autoen-coder network is trained on continuous wavelet transforms of heart rate variability signals calculated from publicly-available annotated ECG records with a wide variety of conditions. The latent variables learned by the clustering autoencoder are low-dimensional representations of wavelet transform characteristics that can be visualized and further analyzed. The results indicate that the learned clusters correspond to beat morphologies in the electrocardiogram in many cases, but also that the reduced dimensions of the time-frequency features can potentially provide additional insights into cardiac activity and the autonomic nervous system.

N2  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the effect of automatic tube potential selection and automatic  exposure control combined with female breast displacement during coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) on radiation exposure in women versus men of the same body size. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Consecutive clinical exams between January 2012 and July 2013 at an academic medical center were retrospectively analyzed. All examinations were performed using ECG-gating, automated tube potential, and tube current selection algorithm (APS-AEC) with breast displacement in females. Cohorts were stratified by sex and standard World Health Organization body mass index (BMI) ranges. CT dose index volume (CTDIvol), dose length product (DLP) median effective dose (ED), and size specific dose estimate (SSDE) were recorded. Univariable and multivariable regression analyses were performed to evaluate the effect of gender on radiation exposure per BMI. RESULTS: A total of 726 exams were included, 343 (47%) were females; mean BMI was similar by gender (28.6±6.9 kg/m(2) females vs. 29.2±6.3 kg/m(2) males; P=0.168). Median ED was 2.3 mSv (1.4-5.2) for females and 3.6 (2.5-5.9) for males (P<0.001). Females were exposed to less radiation by a difference in median ED of -1.3 mSv, CTDIvol -4.1 mGy, and SSDE -6.8 mGy (all P<0.001). After adjusting for BMI, patient characteristics, and gating mode, females exposure was lower by a median ED of -0.7 mSv, CTDIvol -2.3 mGy, and SSDE -3.15 mGy, respectively (all P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: We observed a difference in radiation exposure to patients undergoing CCTA with the combined use of AEC-APS and breast displacement in female patients as compared to their BMI-matched male counterparts, with female patients receiving one third less exposure.

N2  - We examined the effects of gender and age in young and middle-aged subjects on the  level of cardio-respiratory interaction by analyzing properties of cardiac, respiratory and cardiac-respiratory regulatory mechanisms under paced breathing. In 56 healthy subjects, ECG (RR interval) and respiratory signal were simultaneously acquired in supine position at paced (0.1-0.45 Hz, steps of 0.05 Hz) and spontaneous breathing. The participants were divided into gender matched group of young adults (19-25 years old) and middle-aged adults (35-44 years old). Power spectral analysis was applied on RR interval time series and spectral components in very low frequency (VLF), low frequency (LF) and high frequency (HF) ranges were computed. We also calculated sample entropy of RR interval series (SampEnRR), respiratory series (SampEnResp), and their cross-sample entropy (cross-SampEn). Under paced breathing, reduction of all spectral powers with age (p<0.05) is not gender dependent but reduction of some entropy measures is; SampEnRR and SampEnResp were lower only in men (p<0.05). In the middle-aged subjects, effect of gender on spectral measures is significant; males had lower HF (p < 0.05). Pattern of dependencies of SampEn and cross-SampEn on paced breathing frequency were significantly different in men (young vs. middle-aged, p = 0.001 and p = 0.037) and in middle-aged subjects (females vs. males, p = 0.011 and p = 0.008). In middle-aged males, lower entropy measures indicated reduced and less complex partial cardiac and respiratory control, and central cardio-respiratory control. In conclusion, in healthy middle-aged subjects changes in cardio-respiratory coupling are detectable only in males.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: The variability observed in the heart rate may reflect fundamental  aspects of cardiac activity. It has been under discussion whether heart rate variability (HRV) is due to noise or chaos, which is irregular behavior occurring in deterministic nonlinear systems. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using chaos analysis techniques, we analyzed HRV of five normal and five human cardiac transplant subjects at rest. HRV is studied using the beat-to-beat RR interval time series extracted from the ECG. The cardiac transplant subjects exhibited a much smaller HRV than the normal subjects because of heart denervation. We present the map and correlation dimension estimation for the RR time series. To test for nonlinear correlations in the dynamics, we built surrogate time series that have the same power spectra as the experimental time series, but also have randomized phases. The experimental and the surrogate data were compared using the correlation integral. No correlation dimension was found for the RR time series of either the normal or the cardiac transplant subjects. Nevertheless, nonlinear correlations were detected in the HRV of the normal subjects but not in HRV of the cardiac transplant subjects. For the latter, no significant changes were observed in the correlation integral as a function of time after transplantation. CONCLUSION: We found no evidence of low-dimensional chaos in the HRV of normal and cardiac transplant subjects. However, some nonlinear correlations were detected in the HRV of the normal subjects, which may be associated with autonomic nervous system influence.

N2  - For medical applications, the ground truth is ascertained through manual labels by  clinical experts. However, significant inter-observer variability and various human biases limit accuracy. A probabilistic framework addresses these issues by comparing aggregated human and automated labels to provide a reliable ground truth, with no prior knowledge of the individual performance. As an alternative to median or mean voting strategies, novel contextual features (signal quality and physiology) were introduced to allow the Probabilistic Label Aggregator (PLA) to weight an algorithm or human based on its performance. As a proof of concept, the PLA was applied to QT interval (pro-arrhythmic indicator) estimation from the electrocardiogram using labels from 20 humans and 48 algorithms crowd-sourced from the 2006 PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge database. For automatic annotations, the root mean square error of the PLA was 13.97 ± 0.46 ms, significantly outperforming the best Challenge entry (16.36 ms) as well as mean and median voting strategies (17.67 ± 0.56 ms and 14.44 ± 0.52 ms respectively with p < 0.05). When selecting three annotators, the PLA improved the annotation accuracy over median aggregation by 10.7% for human annotators and 14.4% for automated algorithms. The PLA could therefore provide an improved "gold standard" for medical annotation tasks even when ground truth is not available.

N2  - This study investigated an electrocardiogram (ECG) eigenvalue automatic analysis and  detection method; ECG eigenvalues were used to reverse the myocardial action potential in order to achieve automatic detection and diagnosis of heart disease. Firstly, the frequency component of the feature signal was extracted based on the wavelet transform, which could be used to locate the signal feature after the energy integral processing. Secondly, this study established a simultaneous equations model of action potentials of the myocardial membrane, using ECG eigenvalues for regression fitting, in order to accurately obtain the eigenvalue vector of myocardial membrane potential. The experimental results show that the accuracy of ECG eigenvalue recognition is more than 99.27%, and the accuracy rate of detection of heart disease such as myocardial ischemia and heart failure is more than 86.7%.

N2  - Cardiovascular toxicity is the most common cause of fatality in the first 24 hours  of poisoning with aluminium phosphide (AlP). Most often manifesting itself in cardiac dysrhythmias. The aim of this study was to evaluate the benefits of amiodarone prophylaxis against cardiac dysrhythmia in 46 patients with acute AlP poisoning. They were divided in two groups of 23: one receiving amiodarone and the other not (control). The treatment group received amiodarone prophylaxis in the initial intravenous bolus dose of 150 mg, followed by a drip of 1 mg/min for six hours and then of 0.5 mg/min for eighteen hours. Both groups were Holter-monitored for 24 hours since admission. Save for amiodarone, both groups received the same standard treatment. Amiodarone had a significant beneficial effect in reducing the frequency of ST-segment elevation and ventricular fibrillation plus atrial fibrillation (P=0.02 and P=0.01, respectively), but the groups did not differ significantly in mortality (9 vs 11 patients, respectively). The mean time between ICU admission and death (survival time) was significantly longer in the treatment group (22 vs 10 h, respectively; P=0.03). Regardless its obvious limitations, our study suggests that even though amiodarone alone did not reduce mortality, it may provide enough time for antioxidant therapy to tip the balance in favour of survival and we therefore advocate its prophylactic use within the first 24 h of AlP poisoning.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to find the best set of characteristics of  polysomnographic signals for the automatic classification of sleep stages. METHODS: A selection was made from 74 measures, including linear spectral measures, interdependency measures, and nonlinear measures of complexity that were computed for the all-night polysomnographic recordings of 20 healthy subjects. The adopted multidimensional analysis involved quadratic discriminant analysis, forward selection procedure, and selection by the best subset procedure. Two situations were considered: the use of four polysomnographic signals (EEG, EMG, EOG, and ECG) and the use of the EEG alone. RESULTS: For the given database, the best automatic sleep classifier achieved approximately an 81% agreement with the hypnograms of experts. The classifier was based on the next 14 features of polysomnographic signals: the ratio of powers in the beta and delta frequency range (EEG, channel C3), the fractal exponent (EMG), the variance (EOG), the absolute power in the sigma 1 band (EEG, C3), the relative power in the delta 2 band (EEG, O2), theta/gamma (EEG, C3), theta/alpha (EEG, O1), sigma/gamma (EEG, C4), the coherence in the delta 1 band (EEG, O1-O2), the entropy (EMG), the absolute theta 2 (EEG, Fp1), theta/alpha (EEG, Fp1), the sigma 2 coherence (EEG, O1-C3), and the zero-crossing rate (ECG); however, even with only four features, we could perform sleep scoring with a 74% accuracy, which is comparable to the inter-rater agreement between two independent specialists. CONCLUSIONS: We have shown that 4-14 carefully selected polysomnographic features were sufficient for successful sleep scoring. The efficiency of the corresponding automatic classifiers was verified and conclusively demonstrated on all-night recordings from healthy adults.

N2  - Early detection of asymptomatic atrial fibrillation (AF) provides an opportunity to  treat patients to reduce their risk of stroke. Long-term residents of skilled nursing facilities frequently have multiple risk factors for strokes due to AF and may benefit from screening for AF. Patients in a skilled nursing facility 65 years and older, without a history of AF and without a pacemaker or defibrillator, were evaluated using a Microlife WatchBP Home A automatic blood pressure monitor that can detect AF when set to a triple reading mode. Those with readings positive for AF were evaluated with a standard 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) or a 30-second single-channel ECG to confirm the presence of AF. A total of 101 patients were screened with an average age of 78 years, and 48 (48%) were female. Nine automatic blood pressure monitor readings were positive for possible AF. Of those, 7 (6.9%, 95% confidence intervals 3.0% to 14.2%) had AF confirmed with ECG. Only 2 (2%, 95% confidence interval 0.3% to 7.7%) were false-positive readings. One-time screening for AF using an automatic blood pressure monitor in a skilled nursing facility resulted in a high number of patients with newly diagnosed AF.

N2  - The increasing dissemination of wearable ECG recorders (e.g. Holter, patches, and  strap sensors) enables the acquisition of large amounts of data during long periods of time. However, the clinical value of these long-term continuous recordings is hindered by the lack of automatic tools to extract clinically relevant information (other than non-sinus and life-threatening rhythms) from such long-term data, particularly when targeting population-based research. In this work, we propose and test a new tool for analyzing beat-to-beat interval measurements and extracting features from Holter ECGs. Specifically, we assess the adaptation of the QT interval following sudden changes in heart rate in the primary long QT types (1 & 2). We find that in long QT syndrome type 2, certain QT adaptation patterns can indicate a higher risk for cardiac events.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: This study classifies sleep stages from a single lead electrocardiogram  (ECG) using beat detection, cardiorespiratory coupling in the time-frequency domain and a deep convolutional neural network (CNN). APPROACH: An ECG-derived respiration (EDR) signal and synchronous beat-to-beat heart rate variability (HRV) time series were derived from the ECG using previously described robust algorithms. A measure of cardiorespiratory coupling (CRC) was extracted by calculating the coherence and cross-spectrogram of the EDR and HRV signal in 5 min windows. A CNN was then trained to classify the sleep stages (wake, rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep, non-REM (NREM) light sleep and NREM deep sleep) from the corresponding CRC spectrograms. A support vector machine was then used to combine the output of CNN with the other features derived from the ECG, including phase-rectified signal averaging (PRSA), sample entropy, as well as standard spectral and temporal HRV measures. The MIT-BIH Polysomnographic Database (SLPDB), the PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2018 database (CinC2018) and the Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS) database, all expert-annotated for sleep stages, were used to train and validate the algorithm. MAIN RESULTS: Ten-fold cross validation results showed that the proposed algorithm achieved an accuracy (Acc) of 75.4% and a Cohen's kappa coefficient of [Formula: see text]  =  0.54 on the out of sample validation data in the classification of Wake, REM, NREM light and deep sleep in SLPDB. This rose to Acc  =  81.6% and [Formula: see text]  =  0.63 for the classification of Wake, REM sleep and NREM sleep and Acc  =  85.1% and [Formula: see text]  =  0.68 for the classification of NREM sleep versus REM/wakefulness in SLPDB. SIGNIFICANCE: The proposed ECG-based sleep stage classification approach that represents the highest reported results on non-electroencephalographic data and uses datasets over ten times larger than those in previous studies. By using a state-of-the-art QRS detector and deep learning model, the system does not require human annotation and can therefore be scaled for mass analysis.

N2  - Timely prediction of cardiovascular diseases with the help of a computer-aided  diagnosis system minimizes the mortality rate of cardiac disease patients. Cardiac arrhythmia detection is one of the most challenging tasks, because the variations of electrocardiogram(ECG) signal are very small, which cannot be detected by human eyes. In this study, an 11-layer deep convolutional neural network model is proposed for classification of the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database into five classes according to the ANSI-AAMI standards. In this CNN model, we designed a complete end-to-end structure of the classification method and applied without the denoising process of the database. The major advantage of the new methodology proposed is that the number of classifications will reduce and also the need to detect, and segment the QRS complexes, obviated. This MIT-BIH database has been artificially oversampled to handle the minority classes, class imbalance problem using SMOTE technique. This new CNN model was trained on the augmented ECG database and tested on the real dataset. The experimental results portray that the developed CNN model has better performance in terms of precision, recall, F-score, and overall accuracy as compared to the work mentioned in the literatures. These results also indicate that the best performance accuracy of 98.30% is obtained in the 70:30 train-test data set.

N2  - A mobile medical device, dubbed HeartSaver, is developed for real-time monitoring of  a patient's electrocardiogram (ECG) and automatic detection of several cardiac pathologies, including atrial fibrillation, myocardial infarction and atrio-ventricular block. HeartSaver is based on adroit integration of four different modern technologies: electronics, wireless communication, computer, and information technologies in the service of medicine. The physical device consists of four modules: sensor and ECG processing unit, a microcontroller, a link between the microcontroller and the cell phone, and mobile software associated with the system. HeartSaver includes automated cardiac pathology detection algorithms. These algorithms are simple enough to be implemented on a low-cost, limited-power microcontroller but powerful enough to detect the relevant cardiac pathologies. When an abnormality is detected, the microcontroller sends a signal to a cell phone. This operation triggers an application software on the cell phone that sends a text message transmitting information about patient's physiological condition and location promptly to a physician or a guardian. HeartSaver can be used by millions of cardiac patients with the potential to transform the cardiac diagnosis, care, and treatment and save thousands of lives.

N2  - Assuming that RR time-series behave as a fractionally differintegrated Gaussian  process, García-González et al. (2003) recently proposed new indices for quantifying variability and structure in RR data. One of these was the 'fractional noise quantifier' (fnQ), measuring the departure of an RR time-series from a monofractal structure (i.e. a measure of its multifractality). Sixty-nine participants (aged = 34·5 ± 12·4 years, body mass index (BMI) = 23·9 ± 2·9 kg m(-2) , maximal oxygen uptake rate (V˙O2peak ) = 42·4 ± 10·9 ml min(-1)  kg(-1) , 39 males) provided continuous beat-to-beat ECG recordings for a 24-h period. Fractional differintegration was used to quantify fnQ, and heart rate variability was calculated in the time domain. All variables were evaluated during consecutive 1-h periods and also during four 6-h blocks corresponding to morning, afternoon, evening and night periods. Apart from RR, circadian trends in all variables were independent of gender (P = 0·11-0·59). Apart from fnQ, all variables exhibited circadian variation (0·0005<P<0·012). Although fnQ was statistically uniform during the 24-h period, it showed a trend towards elevated values during evening and night. The main finding of this study was that fnQ was elevated by around 10% during the evening and night, although this was not statistically significant. This suggests that the structure of RR time-series in healthy individuals is most strongly 'multifractal' during evening and night periods. fnQ appears to be a plausible surrogate measure of multifractality in RR time-series.

N2  - Defibrillation is often required to terminate a ventricular fibrillation or fast  ventricular tachycardia rhythm and resume a perfusing rhythm in sudden cardiac arrest patients. Automated external defibrillators rely on automatic ECG analysis algorithms to detect the presence of shockable rhythms before advising the rescuer to deliver a shock. For a reliable rhythm analysis, chest compression must be interrupted to prevent corruption of the ECG waveform due to the artifact induced by the mechanical activity of compressions. However, these hands-off intervals adversely affect the success of treatment. To minimize the hands-off intervals and increase the chance of successful resuscitation, we developed a method which asks for interrupting the compressions only if the underlying ECG rhythm cannot be accurately determined during chest compressions. Using this method only a small percentage of cases need compressions interruption, hence a significant reduction in hands-off time is achieved. Our algorithm comprises a novel filtering technique for the ECG and thoracic impedance waveforms, and an innovative method to combine analysis from both filtered and unfiltered data. Requiring compression interruption for only 14% of cases, our algorithm achieved a sensitivity of 92% and specificity of 99%.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Excessive electrocardiographic alarms contribute to "alarm fatigue,"  which can lead to patient harm. In a prior study, one-third of audible electrocardiographic alarms were for accelerated ventricular rhythm (AVR), and most of these alarms were false. It is uncertain whether true AVR alarms are clinically relevant. OBJECTIVES: To determine from bedside electrocardiographic monitoring data (1) how often true AVR alarms are acknowledged by clinicians, (2) whether such alarms are actionable, and (3) whether such alarms are associated with adverse outcomes ("code blue," death). METHODS: Secondary analysis using data from a study conducted in an academic medical center involving 5 adult intensive care units with 77 beds. Electronic health records of 23 patients with 223 true alarms for AVR were examined. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 62.9 years, and 61% were white and male. All 223 of the true alarms were configured at the warning level (ie, 2 continuous beeps), and 215 (96.4%) lasted less than 30 seconds. Only 1 alarm was acknowledged in the electronic health record. None of the alarms were clinically actionable or led to a code blue or death. CONCLUSIONS: True AVR alarms may contribute to alarm fatigue. Hospitals should reevaluate the need for close monitoring of AVR and consider configuring this alarm to an inaudible message setting to reduce the risk of patient harm due to alarm fatigue. Prospective studies involving larger patient samples and varied monitors are warranted.

N2  - AIM: To assess and promote compliance of Italian cardiological intensive care units  (CCUs) with evidence-based guidelines for the management of acute myocardial infarction (MI). METHODS AND RESULTS: The process of diagnosis and treatment of MI was prospectively evaluated in 163 CCUs by use of 30 indicators during two enrolment phases, each followed by a feedback of both local and general performance. Overall, 5854 patients with ST-segment elevation MI (STEMI) and 5852 with non-ST-segment elevation MI (NSTEMI) were consecutively enrolled. The target for each indicator was defined as compliance with the relevant recommendations in ≥90% of suitable patients and it was met for nine (30%) and 10 (33.3%) indicators in the first and second phases, respectively. Regardless of target, a significant improvement in compliance was observed in the second phase in 10 out of 30 indicators (33.3%). Use of pre-hospital ECG, expedite delivery of reperfusion therapy, dosage of antithrombotic drugs, and non-pharmacological implementation of secondary prevention were often off target. Similar in-hospital mortality was observed in phases I and II, both in patients with STEMI (4.0 vs. 4.2%, p=0.79) and NSTEMI (1.8 vs. 2.4%, p=0.11). Overall, 30-day mortality were 5.7% for patients with STEMI and 3.4% with NSTEMI. CONCLUSIONS: Performance indicators can accurately weigh the whole process of diagnosis and treatment of patients with MI and monitor the improvements in the quality of care. In our large population of consecutive patients, satisfactory 30-day outcomes were observed despite suboptimal adherence to guidelines for some indicators of recognised prognostic relevance.

N2  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Currently Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) is one of the most  prevalent diseases, and also can lead to death, disability and economic loss in patients who suffer from cardiovascular disease. Diagnostic procedures of this disease by medical teams are typically invasive, although they do not satisfy the required accuracy. METHODS: In this study, we have proposed a methodology for the automatic diagnosis of normal and Coronary Artery Disease conditions using Heart Rate Variability (HRV) signal extracted from electrocardiogram (ECG). The features are extracted from HRV signal in time, frequency and nonlinear domains. The Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied to reduce the dimension of the extracted features in order to reduce computational complexity and to reveal the hidden information underlaid in the data. Finally, Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier has been utilized to classify two classes of data using the extracted distinguishing features. In this paper, parameters of the SVM have been optimized in order to improve the accuracy. RESULTS: Provided reports in this paper indicate that the detection of CAD class from normal class using the proposed algorithm was performed with accuracy of 99.2%, sensitivity of 98.43%, and specificity of 100%. CONCLUSIONS: This study has shown that methods which are based on the feature extraction of the biomedical signals are an appropriate approach to predict the health situation of the patients.

N2  - The presence of respiratory activity in the electrocardiogram (ECG), the pulse  oximeter's photoplethysmo-graphic and continuous arterial blood pressure signals is a well-documented phenomenon. In this paper, we demonstrate that such information is also present in the oscillometric signal acquired from automatic non-invasive blood pressure monitors, and may be used to estimate the vital sign respiratory rate (RR). We propose a novel method that combines the information from the two respiratory-induced variations (frequency and amplitude) via frequency analysis to both estimate RR and eliminate estimations considered to be unreliable because of poor signal quality. The method was evaluated using data acquired from 40 subjects containing ECG, respiration and blood pressure waveforms, the latter acquired using an in-house built blood pressure device that is able to connect to a mobile phone. Results demonstrated a good RR estimation accuracy of our method when compared to the reference values extracted from the reference respiration waveforms (mean absolute error of 2.69 breaths/min), which is comparable to existing methods in the literature that extract RR from other physiological signals. The proposed method has been implemented in Java on the Android device for use in an mHealth platform.

ECGs contaminated by noise or artifacts disrupt the normal functioning of the automatic analysis algorithm. The objective of this study is to evaluate a method of measuring the HCP variation in motion artifacts through direct monitoring. The proposed wearable sensing device has two channels. One channel is used to measure the ECG through a differential amplifier. The other is for monitoring motion artifacts using the modified electrode and the same differential amplifier. Noise reduction was performed using adaptive filtering, based on a reference signal highly correlated with it. Direct measurement of HCP variations can eliminate the need for additional sensors.

N2  - Computational atrial models aid the understanding of pathological mechanisms and  therapeutic measures in basic research. The use of biophysical models in a clinical environment requires methods to personalize the anatomy and electrophysiology (EP). Strategies for the automation of model generation and for evaluation are needed. In this manuscript, the current efforts of clinical atrial modeling in the euHeart project are summarized within the context of recent publications in this field. Model-based segmentation methods allow for the automatic generation of ready-to-simulate patient-specific anatomical models. EP models can be adapted to patient groups based on a-priori knowledge and to the individual without significant further data acquisition. ECG and intracardiac data build the basis for excitation personalization. Information from late enhancement (LE) MRI can be used to evaluate the success of radio-frequency ablation (RFA) procedures and interactive virtual atria pave the way for RFA planning. Atrial modeling is currently in a transition from the sole use in basic research to future clinical applications. The proposed methods build the framework for model-based diagnosis and therapy evaluation and planning. Complex models allow to understand biophysical mechanisms and enable the development of simplified models for clinical applications.

N2  - Modified Early Warning Scores (MEWS) provide real-time vital sign (VS) trending and  reduce ICU admissions in post-operative patients. These early warning calculations classically incorporate oxygen saturation, heart rate, respiratory rate, systolic blood pressure, and temperature but have not previously included end-tidal CO2 (EtCO(2)), more recently identified as an independent predictor of critical illness. These systems may be subject to failure when physiologic data is incorrectly measured, leading to false alarms and increased workload. This study investigates whether the implementation of automated devices that utilize ongoing vital signs monitoring and MEWS calculations, inclusive of a score for end-tidal CO(2) (EtCO(2)), can be feasibly implemented on the general care hospital floor and effectively identify derangements in a post-operative patient's condition while limiting the amount of false alarms that would serve to increase provider workload. From July to November 2014, post-operative patients meeting the inclusion criteria (BMI > 30 kg/m(2), history of obstructive sleep apnea, or the use of patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) or epidural narcotics) were monitored using automated devices that record minute-by-minute VS included in classic MEWS calculations as well as EtCO(2). Automated messages via pagers were sent to providers for instances when the device measured elevated MEWS, abnormal EtCO(2), and oxygen desaturations below 85 %. Data, including alarm and message details from the first 133 patients, were recorded and analyzed. Overall, 3.3 alarms and pages sounded per hour of monitoring. Device-only alarms sounded 2.7 times per hour-21 % were technical alarms. The remaining device-only alarms for concerning VS sounded 2.0/h, 70 % for falsely recorded VS. Pages for abnormal EtCO(2) sounded 0.4/h (82 % false recordings) while pages for low blood oxygen saturation sounded 0.1/h (55 % false alarms). 143 times (0.1 pages/h) the devices calculated a MEWS warranting a page (rise in MEWS by 2 or 5 or greater)-62 % were false scores inclusive of falsely recorded VS. An abnormal EtCO(2) value resulted in or added to an elevated MEWS score in 29 % of notifications, but 50 % of these included a falsely abnormal EtCO(2) value. To date, no adverse events have occurred. There were no statistically significant demographic, post-operative condition, or pre-existing comorbidity differences between patients who had a majority of true alarms from those who had mostly false-positive alarms. Although not statistically significant, the group of patients in whom automated MEWS suggested greater utility included those with a history of hypertension (p = 0.072) and renal disease (p = 0.084). EtCO(2) monitoring was more likely to be useful in patients with a history of type 2 diabetes, coronary artery disease, and obstructive sleep apnea (p < 0.05). These patients were also more likely to have been on a PCA post-operatively (p < 0.05). Overall, non-invasive physiologic monitoring incorporating an automated MEWS system, modified to include end-tidal CO2 can be feasibly implemented in a hospital ward. Further study is needed to evaluate its clinical utility, including an end-tidal CO(2) score, is feasibly implemented and can be useful in monitoring select post-operative patients for derangements in physiologic metrics. Like any other monitoring system, false alarms may occur at high rates. While further study is needed to determine the additive utility of EtCO(2) in MEWS calculations, this study suggests utility of EtCO(2) in select post-operative patients.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Channelopathies are associated with mutations of genes encoding  proteins creating or interacting with the specialized ion channels in myocardial cell membranes, thus forming arrhythmogenic substrate predisposing the patient to sudden cardiac death. The study focuses the clinical and ECG presentation and management of children with channelopathies in Slovakia. SUBJECT AND METHODS: Twenty-two children with suspected channelopathy were admitted to Children's Cardiac Center Bratislava in the years 2007-2014. Genetic testing was made in 19 patients. RESULTS: Fourteen patients were symptomatic. Long QT syndrome was genetically proven in eight and catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia in five patients. Twenty children are treated with beta-blockers, five in combination with mexiletine or flecainide. Nine patients received implantable cardiac defibrillator and one underwent left cardiac sympathetic denervation. CONCLUSION: Both clinical presentation and genetic testing must be considered in the diagnostic and therapeutic process of channelopathies. Early diagnosis allows for adequate treatment and lifestyle modification.

N2  - This paper presents a novel approach for false alarm suppression using machine  learning tools. It proposes a multi-modal detection algorithm to find the true beats using the information from all the available waveforms. This method uses a variety of beat detection algorithms, some of which are developed by the authors. The outputs of the beat detection algorithms are combined using a machine learning approach. For the ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation alarms, separate classification models are trained to distinguish between the normal and abnormal beats. This information, along with alarm-specific criteria, is used to decide if the alarm is false. The results indicate that the presented method was effective in suppressing false alarms when it was tested on a hidden validation dataset.

N2  - This paper intends to bring new insights in the methods for extracting features for  cardiac arrhythmia detection and classification systems. We explore the possibility for utilizing vectorcardiograms (VCG) along with electrocardiograms (ECG) to get relevant informations from the heartbeats on the MIT-BIH database. For this purpose, we apply complex networks to extract features from the VCG. We follow the ANSI/AAMI EC57:1998 standard, for classifying the beats into 5 classes (N, V, S, F and Q), and de Chazal's scheme for dataset division into training and test set, with 22 folds validation setup for each set. We used the Support Vector Machinhe (SVM) classifier and the best result we chose had a global accuracy of 84.1%, while still obtaining relatively high Sensitivities and Positive Predictive Value and low False Positive Rates, when compared to other papers that follows the same evaluation methodology that we do.

N2  - The aim of this paper is to endow a well-known structure for processing  time-dependent information, synaptic delay-based ANN's, with a reliable and easy to implement algorithm suitable for training temporal decision processes. In fact, we extend the backpropagation algorithm to discrete-time feedforward networks that include adaptable internal time delays in the synapses. The structure of the network is similar to the one presented by [1], that is, in addition to the weights modeling the transmission capabilities of the synaptic connections, we model their length by means of a parameter that indicates the delay a discrete-event suffers when going from Zthe origin neuron to the target neuron through a synaptic connection. Like the weights, these delays are also trainable, and a training algorithm can be derived that is almost as simple as the backpropagation algorithm, and which is really an extension of it. We present examples of the application of these networks and algorithm to the prediction of time series and to the recognition of patterns in electrocardiographic signals. In the first case, we employ the temporal reasoning characteristics of these networks for the prediction of future values in a benchmark example of a time series: the one governed by the Mackey-Glass chaotic equation. In the second case, we provide a real life example. The problem consists in identifying different types of beats through two levels of temporal processing, one relating the morphological features which make up the beat in time and another one that relates the positions of beats in time, that is, considers rhythm characteristics of the ECG signal. In order to do this, the network receives the signal sequentially, no windowing, segmentation, or thresholding are applied.

N2  - Heart rate variability (HRV) is governed by the autonomic nervous system (ANS) and  is routinely used to estimate the state of body and mind. At the same time, recorded HRV features can vary substantially between people. A model for HRV that (1) correctly simulates observed HRV, (2) reliably functions for multiple scenarios, and (3) can be personalised using a manageable set of parameters, would be a significant step forward toward understanding individual responses to external influences, such as physical and physiological stress. Current HRV models attempt to reproduce HRV characteristics by mimicking the statistical properties of measured HRV signals. The model presented here for the simulation of HRV follows a radically different approach, as it is based on an approximation of the physiology behind the triggering of a heart beat and the biophysics mechanisms of how the triggering process-and thereby the HRV-is governed by the ANS. The model takes into account the metabolisation rates of neurotransmitters and the change in membrane potential depending on transmitter and ion concentrations. It produces an HRV time series that not only exhibits the features observed in real data, but also explains a reduction of low frequency band-power for physically or psychologically high intensity scenarios. Furthermore, the proposed model enables the personalisation of input parameters to the physiology of different people, a unique feature not present in existing methods. All these aspects are crucial for the understanding and application of future wearable health.

N2  - AIM: An automatic resuscitation rhythm annotator (ARA) would facilitate and enhance  retrospective analysis of resuscitation data, contributing to a better understanding of the interplay between therapy and patient response. The objective of this study was to define, implement, and demonstrate an ARA architecture for complete resuscitation episodes, including chest compression pauses (CC-pauses) and chest compression intervals (CC-intervals). METHODS: We analyzed 126.5h of ECG and accelerometer-based chest-compression depth data from 281 out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) patients. Data were annotated by expert reviewers into asystole (AS), pulseless electrical activity (PEA), pulse-generating rhythm (PR), ventricular fibrillation (VF), and ventricular tachycardia (VT). Clinical pulse annotations were based on patient-charts and impedance measurements. An ARA was developed for CC-pauses, and was used in combination with a chest compression artefact removal filter during CC-intervals. The performance of the ARA was assessed in terms of the unweighted mean of sensitivities (UMS). RESULTS: The UMS of the ARA were 75.0% during CC-pauses and 52.5% during CC-intervals, 55-points and 32.5-points over a random guess (20% for five categories). Filtering increased the UMS during CC-intervals by 5.2-points. Sensitivities for AS, PEA, PR, VF, and VT were 66.8%, 55.8%, 86.5%, 82.1% and 83.8% during CC-pauses; and 51.1%, 34.1%, 58.7%, 86.4%, and 32.1% during CC-intervals. CONCLUSIONS: A general ARA architecture was defined and demonstrated on a comprehensive OHCA dataset. Results showed that semi-automatic resuscitation rhythm annotation, which may involve further revision/correction by clinicians for quality assurance, is feasible. The performance (UMS) dropped significantly during CC-intervals and sensitivity was lowest for PEA.

N2  - Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are a promising machine learning technique in  classifying non-linear electrocardiogram (ECG) signals and recognizing abnormal patterns suggesting risks of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). In this paper, we propose a new reusable neuron architecture (RNA) enabling a performance-efficient and cost-effective silicon implementation for ANN. The RNA architecture consists of a single layer of physical RNA neurons, each of which is designed to use minimal hardware resource (e.g., a single 2-input multiplier-accumulator is used to compute the dot product of two vectors). By carefully applying the principal of time sharing, RNA can multiplexs this single layer of physical neurons to efficiently execute both feed-forward and back-propagation computations of an ANN while conserving the area and reducing the power dissipation of the silicon. A three-layer 51-30-12 ANN is implemented in RNA to perform the ECG classification for CVD detection. This RNA hardware also allows on-chip automatic training update. A quantitative design space exploration in area, power dissipation, and execution speed between RNA and three other implementations representative of different reusable hardware strategies is presented and discussed. Compared with an equivalent software implementation in C executed on an embedded microprocessor, the RNA ASIC achieves three orders of magnitude improvements in both the execution speed and the energy efficiency.

N2  - Many conventional medical monitoring devices, while not technically invasive, are  nevertheless obtrusive insofar as they require contact with the patient. This obtrusiveness sometimes poses problems in daily clinical practice. The need for contact with electrodes or transducers is particularly relevant in the case of patients recovering in intensive care units where continuous monitoring is required, in turn requiring continuous direct transducer contact for prolonged periods. Among the many physiological parameters commonly acquired, the respiratory and the cardiac rates of the patients are of primary importance. Typically these two parameters are measured respectively using spirometry and electrocardiography (ECG), both involving obtrusive measurement systems requiring contact with the patient with an air conduit and electrodes. This paper presents an optical measurement method for the simultaneous assessment of respiration and heart rates based on the measurement of the chest wall movements, associated with inspiratory/expiratory activities of the lungs and by the mechanical pumping action of the heart. The measurement method has been adapted for use with preterm infants and it has been applied to 55 patients recovering in a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. The method is based on the use of a laser Doppler vibrometer (LDVi) pointed at the left, ventral thoracic surface of the patient. LDVi-based measures of respiration and heart rate have been simultaneously acquired for each patient, in parallel with the same quantities acquired using conventional reference instrumentation (flow-meter and ECG) for comparison purposes. Results show that for respiration rate, differences with respect to the spirometer data are <3%, while for the cardiac rate they are <6% with respect to ECG data. The method proposed in this paper has the advantage of requiring no contact with the patient. Moreover, it supports, by means of a single instrument, the simultaneous measurement of respiration and heart rates, thus reducing the burden of the number of electrodes, transducers, and other instrumentation that must be applied to the patient--a consideration that is particularly important in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. In addition to the measurement of respiration rate, we also describe the sensitivity of the LDVi method in detecting key respiration events (irregular inspiration/expiration cycles, apneas, and hiccups) which are relevant to clinical monitoring.

N2  - Alarm fatigue caused by false alarms and alerts is an extremely important issue for  the medical staff in Intensive Care Units. The ability to predict electrocardiogram and arterial blood pressure waveforms can potentially help the staff and hospital systems better classify a patient's waveforms and subsequent alarms. This paper explores the use of Echo State Networks, a specific type of neural network for mining, understanding, and predicting electrocardiogram and arterial blood pressure waveforms. Several network architectures are designed and evaluated. The results show the utility of these echo state networks, particularly ones with larger integrated reservoirs, for predicting electrocardiogram waveforms and the adaptability of such models across individuals. The work presented here offers a unique approach for understanding and predicting a patient's waveforms in order to potentially improve alarm generation. We conclude with a brief discussion of future extensions of this research.

N2  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Prolonged electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring after ischaemic  stroke increases the diagnostic yield of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (pAF). In order to facilitate the additional workload involved in ECG analysis due to prolonged monitoring times, we investigated the effectiveness of pAF detection with an automated software algorithm (SA) in comparison to the routine staff-based analysis (RA) during standard stroke-unit care. Therefore, patients with acute ischaemic stroke or transitory ischaemic attack presenting with sinus rhythmus on the admission ECG and no history of atrial fibrillation were prospectively included. METHODS: A 24-h Holter ECG assessment was performed using either RA based on a computer-aided evaluation and subsequent review by a cardiologist or a commercially available automated SA. In the case of discordant results concerning the occurrence of pAF between the two methods, the data underwent an independent external rating. RESULTS: Of 809 prospectively enrolled patients, 580 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria. pAF was ultimately diagnosed in 3.3% of the cohort (19 patients). SA and RA correctly diagnosed pAF in 17 patients resulting in a comparable diagnostic effectiveness of the analysis methods (sensitivity: SA 89.5% vs. RA 89.5%; specificity: SA 99.3% vs. RA 99.1%; κ, 0.686; P < 0.001; 95% confidence interval, 0.525-0.847). RA revealed clinically relevant ECG abnormalities in an additional seven patients. CONCLUSIONS: Although it should not completely replace RA, SA-based evaluation of Holter ECG reaches a high diagnostic effectiveness for the detection of pAF and can be used for a rapid and resource-saving analysis of ECG data to deal with prolonged monitoring times.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Generally considered benign, electrocardiographic (ECG) early  repolarization (ER) pattern was claimed to be an indicator of increased susceptibility to ventricular arrhythmias during acute ischemia. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to assess in a nonselected population whether ER pattern documented before ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is associated with risk of hemodynamically unstable ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF) during acute STEMI. METHODS: For STEMI patients admitted for primary percutaneous coronary intervention from 2007-2010, the latest ECGs recorded before STEMI were exported in digital format. After excluding ECGs with paced rhythm and QRS duration ≥120 ms, the remaining ECGs were processed using the Glasgow algorithm allowing automatic ER detection. The association between ER pattern and VT/VF during the first 48 hours of STEMI was tested using logistic regression. RESULTS: ECGs recorded before STEMI were available for 1584 patients. Of these patients, 124 did not meet inclusion criteria, leaving 1460 patients available for analysis (age 68 ± 12 years; 67% male). ER pattern was present in 272 patients (18.6%; ER+ group). ER+ and ER- groups did not differ with regard to clinical characteristics. VT/VF during the first 48 hours of STEMI occurred in 19 ER+ (7.0%) and 105 ER- patients (8.8%; P = .398). ER was not associated with any VT/VF (odds ratio [OR] 0.78; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.47-1.29; P = .324); VT/VF before reperfusion (OR 0.48; 95% CI 0.23-1.001; P = .051); or reperfusion-related VT/VF (OR 1.28; 95% CI 0.55-3.01; P = .569). CONCLUSION: In a nonselected population of STEMI patients, the ER pattern on ECG recorded before the acute coronary event was not associated with VT/VF during the first 48 hours of STEMI.

N2  - Automatic detection of atrial fibrillation (AF) for AF diagnosis, especially for AF  monitoring, is necessarily desirable for clinical therapy. In this study, we proposed a novel method for detection of the transition between AF and sinus rhythm based on RR intervals. First, we obtained the delta RR interval distribution difference curve from the density histogram of delta RR intervals, and then detected its peaks, which represented the AF events. Once an AF event was detected, four successive steps were used to classify its type, and thus, determine the boundary of AF: 1) histogram analysis; 2) standard deviation analysis; 3) numbering aberrant rhythms recognition; and 4) Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test. A dataset of 24-h Holter ECG recordings (n = 433) and two MIT-BIH databases (MIT-BIH AF database and MIT-BIH normal sinus rhythm (NSR) database) were used for development and evaluation. Using the receiver operating characteristic curves for determining the threshold of the K-S test, we have achieved the highest performance of sensitivity and specificity (SP) (96.1% and 98.1%, respectively) for the MIT-BIH AF database, compared with other previously published algorithms. The SP was 97.9% for the MIT-BIH NSR database.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Long-term electrocardiogram (ECG) is one of the important diagnostic  assistant approaches in capturing intermittent cardiac arrhythmias. Combination of miniaturized wearable holters and healthcare platforms enable people to have their cardiac condition monitored at home. The high computational burden created by concurrent processing of numerous holter data poses a serious challenge to the healthcare platform. An alternative solution is to shift the analysis tasks from healthcare platforms to the mobile computing devices. However, long-term ECG data processing is quite time consuming due to the limited computation power of the mobile central unit processor (CPU). METHODS: This paper aimed to propose a novel parallel automatic ECG analysis algorithm which exploited the mobile graphics processing unit (GPU) to reduce the response time for processing long-term ECG data. By studying the architecture of the sequential automatic ECG analysis algorithm, we parallelized the time-consuming parts and reorganized the entire pipeline in the parallel algorithm to fully utilize the heterogeneous computing resources of CPU and GPU. RESULTS: The experimental results showed that the average executing time of the proposed algorithm on a clinical long-term ECG dataset (duration 23.0 ± 1.0 h per signal) is 1.215 ± 0.140 s, which achieved an average speedup of 5.81 ± 0.39× without compromising analysis accuracy, comparing with the sequential algorithm. Meanwhile, the battery energy consumption of the automatic ECG analysis algorithm was reduced by 64.16%. Excluding energy consumption from data loading, 79.44% of the energy consumption could be saved, which alleviated the problem of limited battery working hours for mobile devices. CONCLUSION: The reduction of response time and battery energy consumption in ECG analysis not only bring better quality of experience to holter users, but also make it possible to use mobile devices as ECG terminals for healthcare professions such as physicians and health advisers, enabling them to inspect patient ECG recordings onsite efficiently without the need of a high-quality wide-area network environment.

N2  - Using LabVIEW programming and high-speed multifunction data acquisition card  PCI-6251, we designed an electrocardiogram (ECG) signal generator based on Chinese typical ECG database. When the ECG signals are given off by the generator, the generator can also display the ECG information annotations at the same time, including waveform data and diagnostic results. It could be a useful assisting tool of ECG automatic diagnose instruments.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Altered right ventricular structure is an important feature of  Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy (ARVC), but is challenging to quantify objectively. The aim of this study was to go beyond ventricular volumes and diameters and to explore if the shape of the right and left ventricles could be assessed and related to clinical measures. We used quantifiable computational methods to automatically identify and analyse malformations in ARVC patients from Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance (CMR) images. Furthermore, we investigated how automatically extracted structural features were related to arrhythmic events. METHODS: A retrospective cross-sectional feasibility study was performed on CMR short axis cine images of 27 ARVC patients and 21 ageing asymptomatic control subjects. All images were segmented at the end-diastolic (ED) and end-systolic (ES) phases of the cardiac cycle to create three-dimensional (3D) bi-ventricle shape models for each subject. The most common components to single- and bi-ventricular shape in the ARVC population were identified and compared to those obtained from the control group. The correlations were calculated between identified ARVC shapes and parameters from the 2010 Task Force Criteria, in addition to clinical outcomes such as ventricular arrhythmias. RESULTS: Bi-ventricle shape for the ARVC population showed, as ordered by prevalence with the percent of total variance in the population explained by each shape: global dilation/shrinking of both ventricles (44 %), elongation/shortening at the right ventricle (RV) outflow tract (15 %), tilting at the septum (10 %), shortening/lengthening of both ventricles (7 %), and bulging/shortening at both the RV inflow and outflow (5 %). Bi-ventricle shapes were significantly correlated to several clinical diagnostic parameters and outcomes, including (but not limited to) correlations between global dilation and electrocardiography (ECG) major criteria (p = 0.002), and base-to-apex lengthening and history of arrhythmias (p = 0.003). Classification of ARVC vs. control using shape modes yielded high sensitivity (96 %) and moderate specificity (81 %). CONCLUSION: We presented for the first time an automatic method for quantifying and analysing ventricular shapes in ARVC patients from CMR images. Specific ventricular shape features were highly correlated with diagnostic indices in ARVC patients and yielded high classification sensitivity. Ventricular shape analysis may be a novel approach to classify ARVC disease, and may be used in diagnosis and in risk stratification for ventricular arrhythmias.

N2  - Four temporal and four spectral parameters of heart rate variability were compared  after they were computed with two different time series generation methods: the RR intervals and the numerical values of heart rate provided by the Finapres. Recordings were obtained from 10 healthy subjects throughout five experimental conditions: supine, standing, controlled breathing, exercise and recovery. The mean and the RMS value of successive differences showed significant differences between the two methods. The spectral parameters were statistically different only during standing and exercise. The larger high frequency component and the lower HF/LF ratio by the Finapres method, observed during exercise, can be explained by the higher breathing influence on the peak-to-peak pressure intervals, in relation to RR intervals. Therefore, the high frequency component within mechanic intervals could possibly reflect the non-neural respiratory influence. In conclusion, values of heart rate provided by the Finapres are not completely interchangeable with those obtained from the ECG during the studied conditions.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Automatic detection of atrial fibrillation (AF) in electrocardiograms  (ECGs) is beneficial for AF diagnosis, therapy, and management. In this article, a novel method of AF detection is introduced. Most current methods only utilize the RR interval as a critical parameter to detect AF; thus, these methods commonly confuse AF with other arrhythmias. METHODS: We used the average number of f waves in a TQ interval as a characteristic parameter in our robust, real-time AF detection method. Three types of clinical ECG data, including ECGs from normal, AF, and non-AF arrhythmia subjects, were downloaded from multiple open access databases to validate the proposed method. RESULTS: The experimental results suggested that the method could distinguish between AF and normal ECGs with accuracy, sensitivity, and positive predictive values (PPVs) of 93.67%, 94.13%, and 98.69%, respectively. These values are comparable to those of related methods. The method was also able to distinguish between AF and non-AF arrhythmias and had performance indexes (accuracy 94.62%, sensitivity 94.13%, and PPVs 97.67%) that were considerably better than those of other methods. CONCLUSIONS: Our proposed method has prospects as a practical tool enabling clinical diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring of AF.

N2  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The analysis of the pulsation of unruptured intracranial  aneurysms might improve the assessment of their stability and risk of rupture. Pulsations can easily be concealed due to the small movements of the aneurysm wall, making post-processing highly demanding. We hypothesized that the quantification of aneurysm pulsation is technically feasible and can be improved by computer-aided post-processing. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Images of 14 cerebral aneurysms were acquired with an ECG-triggered 4D CTA. Aneurysms were post-processed manually and computer-aided on a 3D model. Volume curves and random noise-curves were compared with the arterial pulse wave and volume curves were compared between both post-processing modalities. RESULTS: The aneurysm volume curves showed higher similarity with the pulse wave than the random curves (Hausdorff-distances 0.12 vs 0.25, p<0.01). Both post-processing methods did not differ in intra- (r = 0.45 vs r = 0.54, p>0.05) and inter-observer (r = 0.45 vs r = 0.54, p>0.05) reliability. Time needed for segmentation was significantly reduced in the computer-aided group (3.9 ± 1.8 min vs 20.8 ± 7.8 min, p<0.01). CONCLUSION: Our results show pulsatile changes in a subset of the studied aneurysms with the final prove of underlying volume changes remaining unsettled. Semi-automatic post-processing significantly reduces post-processing time but cannot yet replace manual segmentation.

N2  - Spontaneous BRS estimates may considerable vary according to the technique of blood  pressure and heart rate assessment. To optimise and standardise BRS estimation for clinical use we evaluated possible differences between spontaneous BRS indices estimated from either finger plethysmography or radial tonometry. Forty-five healthy volunteers underwent simultaneous recordings of electrocardiogram, finger plethysmography and radial tonometry in supine position and during 60° head-up tilt. BRS was computed by spectral analysis from either R-R time series and/or arterial pressure pulse. Radial tonometry generated higher mean BRS estimates than finger plethysmography. The difference decreased upon postural change from supine to upright. In the upright position, BRS estimates based on R-R interval proved to be generally lower compared to BRS indices estimated from arterial pressure pulse. The ratio of low-to-high-frequency power of inter-systolic interval and systolic blood pressure from tonometry was lower than that from plethysmography in supine and approximated in upright position. Spectral parameters of inter-systolic interval and R-R interval did not differ in supine but diverged in upright position. Changes of spectral parameters were most pronounced in R-R interval. Arterial pressure pulse is adequate for estimation of BRS under resting conditions but it may distort BRS estimates under physical load. We, therefore, recommend using an ECG signal for BRS estimation especially in non-stationary conditions.

N2  - The present study aimed to further unravel the effects of nasal continuous positive  airway pressure (nCPAP) on the cardiovascular and respiratory systems in the neonatal period. Six-hour polysomnographic recordings were first performed in seven healthy newborn lambs, aged 2-3 days, without and with nCPAP application at 6 cmH(2)O (nCPAP-6), in randomized order. The effects of nCPAP-6 on heart rate variability, respiratory rate variability, and cardiorespiratory interrelations were analyzed using a semiautomatic signal processing approach applied to ECG and respiration recordings. Thereafter, a cardiorespiratory mathematical model was adapted to the experimental conditions to gain further physiological interpretation and to simulate higher nCPAP levels (8 and 10 cmH(2)O). Results from the signal processing approach suggest that nCPAP-6 applied in newborns with healthy lungs: 1) increases heart rate and decreases the time and frequency domain indices of heart rate variability, especially those representing parasympathetic activity, while increasing the complexity of the RR-interval time series; 2) prolongs the respiratory cycle and expiration duration and decreases respiratory rate variability; and 3) slightly impairs cardiorespiratory interrelations. Model-based analysis revealed that nCPAP-6 increases the heart rate and decreases respiratory sinus arrhythmia amplitude, in association with a reduced parasympathetic efferent activity. These results were accentuated when simulating an increased CPAP level. Overall, our results provide a further understanding of the effects of nCPAP in neonates, in the absence of lung disease.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Application of nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) at 6 cmH(2)O, a level very frequently used in newborns, alters heart and respiratory rate variability, as well as cardiorespiratory interrelations in a full-term newborn model without lung disease. Moreover, whereas nasal CPAP at 6 cmH(2)O decreases parasympathetic efferent activity, there is no change in sympathetic efferent activity.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Limitations of the manual scoring of polysomnograms, which include data  from electroencephalogram (EEG), electro-oculogram (EOG), electrocardiogram (ECG) and electromyogram (EMG) channels have long been recognized. Manual staging is resource intensive and time consuming, and thus considerable effort must be spent to ensure inter-rater reliability. As a result, there is a great interest in techniques based on signal processing and machine learning for a completely Automatic Sleep Stage Classification (ASSC). METHODS: In this paper, we present a single-EEG-sensor ASSC technique based on the dynamic reconfiguration of different aspects of cross-frequency coupling (CFC) estimated between predefined frequency pairs over 5 s epoch lengths. The proposed analytic scheme is demonstrated using the PhysioNet Sleep European Data Format (EDF) Database with repeat recordings from 20 healthy young adults. We validate our methodology in a second sleep dataset. RESULTS: We achieved very high classification sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of 96.2 ± 2.2%, 94.2 ± 2.3%, and 94.4 ± 2.2% across 20 folds, respectively, and also a high mean F1 score (92%, range 90-94%) when a multi-class Naive Bayes classifier was applied. High classification performance has been achieved also in the second sleep dataset. CONCLUSIONS: Our method outperformed the accuracy of previous studies not only on different datasets but also on the same database. SIGNIFICANCE: Single-sensor ASSC makes the entire methodology appropriate for longitudinal monitoring using wearable EEG in real-world and laboratory-oriented environments.

N2  - Monitoring the fetal cardiac activity during pregnancy is of crucial importance for  evaluating fetus health. However, there is a lack of automatic and reliable methods for Fetal ECG (FECG) monitoring that can perform this elaboration in real-time. In this paper, we present a hardware architecture, implemented on the Altera Stratix V FPGA, capable of separating the FECG from the maternal ECG and to correctly identify it. We evaluated our system using both synthetic and real tracks acquired from patients beyond the 20th pregnancy week. This work is part of a project aiming at developing a portable system for FECG continuous real-time monitoring. Its characteristics of reduced power consumption, real-time processing capability and reduced size make it suitable to be embedded in the overall system, that is the first proposed exploiting Blind Source Separation with this technology, to the best of our knowledge.

N2  - The incidence of sepsis is increasing, and the condition is now the leading cause of  death in general intensive care units. Our review failed to identify studies of the causes of cardiac arrest among infected patients, even though non-cardiac causes represent 15% of out-of-hospital cardiac arrests and though one-third of events have positive blood cultures. Sudden cardiac arrest is the result of local damage to the heart and of the impact of systemic and pulmonary conditions on cardiac performance, and its danger is underestimated. Necropsy findings in sudden death often identify myocarditis as an unexpected cause. The role of hypoxaemia, severe pulmonary thromboembolism with subsequent pulseless cardiac activity, alterations of electrolytes and hydrogen concentrations, distort fluid distribution with reduced pre-load, direct myocyte damage and adverse cardiac effects related to antibiotic use need to be defined. Many cardiac arrests might be preventable. Because cardiopulmonary resuscitation is challenging and usually unsuccessful in patients with sepsis, research is needed to help predict which patients are at risk. Only half of pneumonia patients with cardiac arrest in the ward receive prior ECG monitoring. Telemedicine and non-invasive monitoring in the ward, avoidance of antibiotics associated with prolonged QT syndrome, and adequate haemodynamic resuscitation might be important in preventing in-hospital arrests among patients with infections.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Right ventricular function predicts outcome in patients with pulmonary  hypertension (PH). Therefore accurate assessment of right ventricular function is essential to graduate severity, assess follow-up, and response to therapy. PURPOSE: To evaluate whether PH severity could be assessed using electrocardiography-gated CT (ECG-gated CT) functional parameters. A further objective was to evaluate cardiac output (CO) using two ECG-gated CT methods: the reference Simpson technique and the fully automatic technique generated by commercially available cardiac software. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Our institutional review board approved this study; patient consent was not required. Twenty-seven patients who had undergone ECG-gated CT and right heart catheterization (RHC) were included. Two independent observers measured pulmonary artery (PA) diameter, PA distensibility, aorta diameter, right ventricular cardiac output (CT-RVCO) and right ventricular ejection fraction (CT-RVEF) with automatic and Simpson techniques on ECG-gated CT. RHC-CO and mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) were measured on RHC. Relationship between ECG-gated CT and RHC measurements was tested with linear regression analysis. RESULTS: Inter-observer agreement was good for all measurements (r > 0.7) except for CT-RVCO calculated with Simpson's technique (r = 0.63). Pulmonary artery (PA) distensibility was significantly correlated to mPAP (r = -0.426, P = 0.027). CT-RVEF was correlated with mPAP only when issued from Simpson technique (r = -0.417, P = 0.034). CT-RVEF was not significantly correlated to RHC-CO (P > 0.2). CT-RVCO measured with Simpson technique (r = 0.487, P = 0.010) and automatic segmentation (r = 0.549, P = 0.005) correlated equally with RHC-CO. CONCLUSION: CT-RVEF and CT-RVCO measured on ECG-gated CT are significantly correlated, respectively, to mPAP and RHC-CO in this population with severe reduction of the right ventricular ejection fraction and could be useful for evaluating and following patients with PH.

N2  - In this paper, a MATLAB-based graphical user interface (GUI) software tool for  general biomedical signal processing and analysis of functional neuroimaging data is introduced. Specifically, electroencephalography (EEG) and electrocardiography (ECG) signals can be processed and analyzed by the developed tool, which incorporates commonly used temporal and frequency analysis methods. In addition to common methods, the tool also provides non-linear chaos analysis with Lyapunov exponents and entropies; multivariate analysis with principal and independent component analyses; and pattern classification with discriminant analysis. This tool can also be utilized for training in biomedical engineering education. This easy-to-use and easy-to-learn, intuitive tool is described in detail in this paper.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate the usefulness of interrupted time series analysis in  clinical trial design. METHODS: A safety data set of electrocardiographic (ECG) information was simulated from actual data that had been collected in a Phase I study. Simulated data on 18 healthy volunteers based on a study performed in a contract research facility were collected based on single doses of an experimental medication that may affect ECG parameters. Serial ECGs were collected before and during treatment with the experimental medication. Data from 7 real subjects receiving placebo were used to simulate the pretreatment phase of time series; data from 18 real subjects receiving active treatment were used to simulate the treatment phase of the time series. Visual inspection of data was performed, followed by tests for trend, seasonality, and autocorrelation by use of SAS. RESULTS: There was no evidence of trend, seasonality, or autocorrelation. In 11 of 18 simulated individuals, statistically significant changes in QTc intervals were observed following treatment with the experimental medication. A significant time of day and treatment interaction was observed in 4 simulated patients. CONCLUSIONS: Interrupted time series analysis techniques offer an additional tool for the study of clinical situations in which patients must act as their own controls and where serial data can be collected at evenly distributed intervals.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Some evidences have shown the role of antioxidant vitamins in preventing  atrial fibrillation (AF) after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. We sought to determine the effect of oral vitamin C on the incidence of postoperative AF in patients undergoing elective isolated on-pump CABG surgery. METHODS: One-hundred patients who underwent isolated CABG surgery were prospectively assigned into two groups: Group 1 - 50 patients received 2 g of oral vitamin C before and 500 mg twice daily lasting for 5 days after surgery; Group 2 - 50 patients as the control group did not receive any. All patients were continuously monitored after surgery in the intensive careunit (ICU), and then Holter monitoring was implemented for 72 h. RESULTS: The mean of patients' age was 61.31 ± 6.42 years. Postoperative AF occurred in 16 and 4 patients in control and treatment groups, respectively (32% vs. 8%, p = 0.003). The ICU stay was 1.79 ± 0.313 and 2.10 ± 0.61 days for vitamin C and control groups, respectively (p = 0.002). The hospital stay was significantly lower in vitamin C group compared with that of the control group (5.32 ± 0.59 vs. 5.74 ± 1.30 days, respectively, p = 0.041). Baseline erythrocyte sedimentation rate (OR 1.030, 95% CI 1.003-1.058, p = 0.030) and taking vitamin C (OR 8.068, 95% CI 1.783-36.517, p = 0.007) were the independent predictors of postoperative AF. CONCLUSIONS: Oral vitamin C can be safely used to decrease the incidence of postoperative AF in patients undergoing elective isolated on-pump CABG surgery.

N2  - Reliable P wave detection is necessary for accurate and automatic electrocardiogram  (ECG) analysis. Currently, methods for P wave detection in physiological conditions are well-described and efficient. However, methods for P wave detection during pathology are not generally found in the literature, or their performance is insufficient. This work introduces a novel method, based on a phasor transform, as well as innovative rules that improve P wave detection during pathology. These rules are based on the extraction of a heartbeats' morphological features and knowledge of heart manifestation during both physiological and pathological conditions. To properly evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm in pathological conditions, a standard database with a sufficient number of reference P wave positions is needed. However, such a database did not exist. Thus, ECG experts annotated 12 chosen pathological records from the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database. These annotations are publicly available via Physionet. The algorithm performance was also validated using physiological records from the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia and QT databases. The results for physiological signals were Se = 98.42% and PP = 99.98%, which is comparable to other methods. For pathological signals, the proposed method reached Se = 96.40% and PP = 85.84%, which greatly outperforms other methods. This improvement represents a huge step towards fully automated analysis systems being respected by ECG experts. These systems are necessary, particularly in the area of long-term monitoring.

N2  - Most of the physiological signals (EEG, ECG, blood flow, human gait, etc.)  characterize by complex dynamics including both non-stationarities and non-linearities. These time series resemble red noise with long-range correlation and 1/(f beta) power spectrum. A question arises as to how to distinguish the characteristics of the process underlying the signal dynamics from the properties of the observed time series. The classical methods to determine possible non-linear (chaotic) dynamics (e.g. correlation dimension) often fail in such signals because of relatively short data records containing stochastic components and non-stationarities. We report an application of several approaches, aimed at (1) determining of the non-stationarities in the signals and (2) testing whether non-linear dynamics exists. Assessment of the intrinsic correlation properties of the dynamic process and distinguishing the same from external trends was performed using singular spectra and detrended fluctuation analysis. The existence of non-linear dynamics was tested by correlation dimension (modified algorithm of re-embedding) and by correlation integrals of real and surrogate data. The correlation integrals of real signal and surrogate data sets were statistically compared using Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test. The procedures were tested on EEG and laser-Doppler (LD) blood flow. Our suggestion is that no one approach taken alone is the best for our aims. Instead, a battery of methods should be used.

N2  - Dofetilide is an antiarrhythmic drug that selectively inhibits the rapid component  of the delayed rectifier potassium current. The administration of dofetilide may cause ventricular arrhythmias and torsade de pointes. Electrocardiographic (ECG) microvolt T-wave alternans (TWA), an electrophysiologic phenomenon consisting in the beat-to-beat alternation of the T-wave amplitude requiring computerized algorithms to be detected, has also been associated to malignant ventricular arrhythmias. Aim of the present study was to evaluate if dofetilide induces TWA during the 24 hours following administration. The study population consisted of 22 healthy subjects ("ECG Effects of Ranolazine, Dofetilide, Verapamil, and Quinidine in Healthy Subjects" database by Physionet) to whom a 500 μg-dose of dofetilide was administered. For each subject, 10 s ECG were acquired at baseline (0.5 hour before dofetilide administration) and at 15 time points during the 24 hours following the drug administration. ECG were then processed for automatic TWA detection by correlation method. In 21 subjects out of 22, after dofetilide administration, TWA significantly increased to a peak value (median TWA values went from 6 μV at baseline to a max 32 μV; p<; 0.05), on average after 5 hours, to then come back to values closer to baseline. Thus, in healthy subjects, dofetilide increases occurrence and levels (6 times baseline value on average) of TWA in the hours following its administration.

N2  - In this paper we employed joint symbolic dynamics (JSD) approach to study  reproducibility of heart rate variability characteristics measured on 2 randomly selected 10-second segments within 3-minute resting orthogonal ECG in 170 healthy participants. First, the ECG R-peaks were detected using parabolic fitting. Second, the respiratory signal was derived from orthogonal ECG X-lead using QRS slopes. Third, time series of R-R intervals and respiratory phases (calculated using Hilbert transform), were transformed into tertiary symbol vectors based on their successive changes and words of length '3' were formed. Bland-Altman analysis was used to assess the agreement between measured log-transformed JSD characteristics of HRV, and their reproducibility. Traditional HRV measures such as RR' interval changes showed a very high reproducibility. However, agreement between two 10-second JSD indices of HRV was low. Interestingly, a significant decrease in low-high alterations of HRV dynamics measured using JSD was observed when respiratory phase transition intervals were excluded (10s: 4.7±9.4 vs. 24.8±21.0%, p<0.0001; 3min: 9.8±8.1 vs. 24.8±12.3%, p<0.0001).

N2  - The large number of automobile accidents due to driver drowsiness is a critical  concern of many countries. To solve this problem, numerous methods of countermeasure have been proposed. However, the results were unsatisfactory due to inadequate accuracy of drowsiness detection. In this study, we introduce a new approach, a combination of EEG and NIRS, to detect driver drowsiness. EEG, EOG, ECG and NIRS signals have been measured during a simulated driving task, in which subjects underwent both awake and drowsy states. The blinking rate, eye closure, heart rate, alpha and beta band power were used to identify subject's condition. Statistical tests were performed on EEG and NIRS signals to find the most informative parameters. Fisher's linear discriminant analysis method was employed to classify awake and drowsy states. Time series analysis was used to predict drowsiness. The oxy-hemoglobin concentration change and the beta band power in the frontal lobe were found to differ the most between the two states. In addition, these two parameters correspond well to an awake to drowsy state transition. A sharp increase of the oxy-hemoglobin concentration change, together with a dramatic decrease of the beta band power, happened several seconds before the first eye closure.

N2  - A novel method for the automatic diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) from an  electrocardiogram (ECG) is presented. This method aims to detect OSA utilizing exclusively ECG recordings during sleep and present a minute-by-minute signal processing technique. In the proposed algorithm, a wide range of features based on heart rate variability (HRV) and ECG-derived respiratory (EDR) signals are considered. The novelty of this study arises from employing bispectral analysis to the HRV and EDR signals in order to illustrate quadratic phase-coupling that can be observed among signal components with different frequencies. From this perspective, in the proposed algorithm, a new feature set based on a higher order spectrum of HRV and EDR signals is introduced and it is utilized to extract information regarding their non-linearity and non-Gaussianity. This feature vector is then fed into the input of a least-square support vector machine classifier. To implement the proposed method, the apnea-ECG database, which contains 70 nocturnal ECG records gathered from volunteer men and women, is used in this work. Results obtained from cross-validating 35 data records show that the normal recordings could be separated from the apneic recordings with an accuracy of 95.57% and a sensitivity and specificity of 98.64% and 92.51%, respectively. In addition, 35 other records were used for a pure independent validation of the proposed method and the obtained accuracy, sensitivity and specificity was 94.12%, 93.46% and 94.79% respectively in OSA episode detection. The performance of our proposed technique is better than in other existing approaches. It can be used as a reliable tool for automatic OSA identification and as a result, it will improve medical services.

N2  - More than 70% of intensive care unit (ICU) patients experience heart rhythm  disturbances, and these patients have correspondingly higher mortality rates. Consequently, one of the standards of care in ICUs is continuous electrocardiography monitoring. One of the potentially preventable dysrhythmic events is the occurrence of torsade de pointes ventricular tachycardia in the setting of acquired prolonged QT interval. This type of ventricular tachycardia can be malignant because it often progresses to ventricular fibrillation. Many factors predispose to lengthening of the QT interval, the most important of which are electrolyte abnormalities and the administration of specific medications. In this review, we discuss the pathophysiology of acquired long QT interval, stressing the medication-induced acquired long QT-interval and factors present in ICU patients that promote prolongation of the QT interval. We also propose guidelines to avoid the occurrence of torsade de pointes ventricular tachycardia.

N2  - Automatic detection of the QRS complexes/R-peaks in an electrocardiogram (ECG)  signal is the most important step preceding any kind of ECG processing and analysis. The performance of these systems heavily relies on the accuracy of the QRS detector. The objective of present work is to drive a new robust method based on stationary wavelet transform (SWT) for R-peaks detection. The decimation of the coefficients at each level of the transformation algorithm is omitted, more samples in the coefficient sequences are available and hence a better outlier detection can be performed. Using the information of local maxima, minima and zero crossings of the fourth SWT coefficient detail, the proposed algorithm identifies the significant points for detection and delineation of the QRS complexes, as well as detection and identification of the QRS individual waves peaks of the pre-processed ECG signal. Various experimental results show that the proposed algorithm exhibits reliable QRS detection as well as accurate ECG delineation, achieving excellent performance on different databases, on the MIT-BIH database (Se=99.84%, P=99.88%), on the QT Database (Se=99.94%, P=99.89%) and on MIT-BIH Noise Stress Test Database, (Se=95.30%, P=93.98%). Reliability and accuracy are close to the highest among the ones obtained in other studies. Experiments results being satisfactory, the SWT may represent a novel QRS detection tool, for a robust ECG signal analysis.

N2  - BACKGROUND: We evaluated the effectiveness of a computer clinical decision support  system (CDSS) for reducing the risk of QT interval prolongation in hospitalized patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: We evaluated 2400 patients admitted to cardiac care units at an urban academic medical center. A CDSS incorporating a validated risk score for QTc prolongation was developed and implemented using information extracted from patients' electronic medical records. When a drug associated with torsades de pointes was prescribed to a patient at moderate or high risk for QTc interval prolongation, a computer alert appeared on the screen to the pharmacist entering the order, who could then consult the prescriber on alternative therapies and implement more intensive monitoring. QTc interval prolongation was defined as QTc interval >500 ms or increase in QTc of ≥60 ms from baseline; for patients who presented with QTc >500 ms, QTc prolongation was defined solely as increase in QTc ≥60 ms from baseline. End points were assessed before (n=1200) and after (n=1200) implementation of the CDSS. CDSS implementation was independently associated with a reduced risk of QTc prolongation (adjusted odds ratio, 0.65; 95% confidence interval, 0.56-0.89; P<0.0001). Furthermore, CDSS implementation reduced the prescribing of noncardiac medications known to cause torsades de pointes, including fluoroquinolones and intravenous haloperidol (adjusted odds ratio, 0.79; 95% confidence interval, 0.63-0.91; P=0.03). CONCLUSIONS: A computer CDSS incorporating a validated risk score for QTc prolongation influences the prescribing of QT-prolonging drugs and reduces the risk of QTc interval prolongation in hospitalized patients with torsades de pointes risk factors.

N2  - In this paper, a novel subject-adaptable heartbeat classification model is  presented, in order to address the significant interperson variations in ECG signals. A multiview learning approach is proposed to automate subject adaptation using a small amount of unlabeled personal data, without requiring manual labeling. The designed subject-customized models consist of two models, namely, general classification model and specific classification model. The general model is trained using similar subjects out of a population dataset, where a pattern matching based algorithm is developed to select the subjects that are "similar" to the particular test subject for model training. In contrast, the specific model is trained mainly on a small amount of high-confidence personal dataset, resulting from multiview-based learning. The learned general model represents the population knowledge, providing an interperson perspective for classification, while the specific model corresponds to the specific knowledge of the subject, offering an intraperson perspective for classification. The two models supplement each other and are combined to achieve improved personalized ECG analysis. The proposed methods have been validated on the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database, yielding an average classification accuracy of 99.4% for ventricular ectopic beat class and 98.3% for supraventricular ectopic beat class, which corresponds to a significant improvement over other published results.

N2  - Spectral analysis of R-R Interval time series is increasingly used to determine  periodic components of heart rate variability (HRV). Particular diagnostic relevance is assigned to a low-frequency (LF) component, associated with blood pressure regulation, and a high-frequency (HF) component, also referred to as respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) in the HRV power spectra. Frequency ranges for parametrisation of power spectra have been defined for either component in numerous publications.Results obtained from examinations with standardised psychic load in which ECG and respiratory signal are continuously recorded and adequately processed have shown that the true individual frequency range of the HF component can be reliably determined only by means of characteristics of respiration (respiratory rate (RR), range and median value of RR, tidal depth). Respiratory rhythms are interindividually extremely differentiated and of individual-specific nature. In many cases LF and HF components may be totally superimposed on each other and, consequently, cannot be diagnostically evaluated.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: Coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA) allows the detection of  obstructive coronary artery disease. However, its ability to predict the hemodynamic significance of stenoses is limited. We assessed differences in plaque characteristics and contrast density difference between hemodynamically significant and non-significant stenoses, as defined by invasive fractional flow reserve (FFR). METHODS: Lesion characteristics of 59 consecutive patients (72 lesions) in whom invasive FFR was performed in at least one coronary artery with moderate to high-grade stenoses in coronary CTA were evaluated by two experienced readers. Coronary CTA data sets were acquired on a second-generation dual-source CT scanner using retrospectively ECG-gated spiral acquisition or prospectively ECG-triggered axial acquisition mode. Plaque volume and composition (non-calcified, calcified), remodeling index as well as contrast density difference (defined as the percentage decline in luminal CT attenuation/cross-sectional area over the lesion) were assessed using a semi-automatic software tool (Autoplaq). Additionally, the transluminal attenuation gradient (defined as the linear regression coefficient between intraluminal CT attenuation and length from the ostium) was determined. Differences in lesion characteristics between hemodynamically significant (invasively measured FFR ≤0.80) and non-significant lesions (FFR >0.80) were determined. RESULTS: Mean patient age was 64±11 years with 44 males (75%). 21 out of 72 coronary artery lesions (29%) were hemodynamically significant according to invasive FFR. Mean invasive FFR was 0.66±0.12 vs. 0.91±0.05 for hemodynamically significant versus non-significant lesions. Hemodynamically significant lesions showed a significantly greater percentage of non-calcified plaque compared to non-hemodynamically relevant lesions (51.3±15.3% vs. 43.6±16.5%, p=0.021). Contrast density difference was significantly increased in hemodynamically relevant lesions (26.0±20.2% vs. 16.6±10.9% for non-significant lesions; p=0.013). At a threshold of ≥24%, the contrast density difference predicted hemodynamically significant lesions with a specificity of 75%, sensitivity of 33%, PPV of 35% and NPV of 73%. The transluminal attenuation gradient showed no significant difference between hemodynamically significant and non-significant lesions (-1.4±1.4HU/mm vs. -1.1±1.3HU/mm, p=n.s.). CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative contrast density difference across coronary lesions in coronary CTA data sets may be applied as a non-invasive tool to identify hemodynamically significant stenoses.

N2  - Automatic sleep stage classification with cardiorespiratory signals has attracted  increasing attention. In contrast to the traditional manual scoring based on polysomnography, these signals can be measured using advanced unobtrusive techniques that are currently available, promising the application for personal and continuous home sleep monitoring. This paper describes a methodology for classifying wake, rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep, and non-REM (NREM) light and deep sleep on a 30 s epoch basis. A total of 142 features were extracted from electrocardiogram and thoracic respiratory effort measured with respiratory inductance plethysmography. To improve the quality of these features, subject-specific Z-score normalization and spline smoothing were used to reduce between-subject and within-subject variability. A modified sequential forward selection feature selector procedure was applied, yielding 80 features while preventing the introduction of bias in the estimation of cross-validation performance. PSG data from 48 healthy adults were used to validate our methods. Using a linear discriminant classifier and a ten-fold cross-validation, we achieved a Cohen's kappa coefficient of 0.49 and an accuracy of 69% in the classification of wake, REM, light, and deep sleep. These values increased to kappa = 0.56 and accuracy = 80% when the classification problem was reduced to three classes, wake, REM sleep, and NREM sleep.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the incidence of cardiovascular adverse events in patients  with sepsis in its various stages. DESIGN: A longitudinal, descriptive, observational study was carried out. SETTING: Intensive care units of two university hospitals in Bogotá (Colombia). PATIENTS: A number of patients consecutively admitted to the adult ICU with a diagnosis of sepsis, and no evidence of previous ischemic myocardial injury. INTERVENTIONS: Forty-eight hours of electrocardiographic record using Holter technology. MAIN VARIABLES: Ischemia, cardiac arrhythmia, heart rate variability. RESULTS: A total of 100 patients were analyzed, 62% being staged as presenting septic shock. Three percent suffered ischemic events detected by Holter and unnoticed through conventional monitoring. Forty-six percent suffered an arrhythmic event detected by Holter, compared with only 6% as detected by conventional monitoring. Mortality was 40%. All patients showed loss of heart rate variability. CONCLUSION: In this study patients with sepsis showed a low incidence of cardiovascular ischemic events. In contrast, arrhythmic events showed a high incidence. Conventional monitoring failed to detect any of the ischemic events and most arrhythmic events. In this study, cardiovascular events generated by adrenergic discharge had no impact upon mortality.

N2  - Wearable intelligent ECG monitoring devices can perform automatic ECG diagnosis in  real time and send out alert signal together with abnormal ECG signal for doctor's further analysis. This provides a means for the patient to identify their heart problem as early as possible and go to doctors for medical treatment. For such system the key requirements include high accuracy and low power consumption. However, the existing wearable intelligent ECG monitoring schemes suffer from high power consumption in both ECG diagnosis and transmission in order to achieve high accuracy. In this work, we have proposed an energy-efficient wearable intelligent ECG monitor scheme with two-stage end-to-end neural network and diagnosis-based adaptive compression. Compared to the state-of-the-art schemes, it significantly reduces the power consumption in ECG diagnosis and transmission while maintaining high accuracy.

N2  - AIMS: Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) devices report percentage pacing as a  diagnostic but cannot determine the effectiveness of each paced beat in capturing left-ventricular (LV) myocardium. Reasons for ineffective LV pacing include improper timing (i.e. pseudofusion) or inadequate pacing output. Device-based determination of effective LV pacing may facilitate optimization of CRT response. METHODS AND RESULTS: Effective capture at the LV cathode results in a negative deflection (QS or QS-r morphology) on a unipolar electrogram (EGM). Morphological features of LV cathode-RV coil EGMs were analysed to develop a device-based automatic algorithm, which classified each paced beat as effective or ineffective LV pacing. The algorithm was validated using acute data from 28 CRT-defibrillator patients. Effective LV pacing and pseudofusion was simulated by pacing at various AV delays. Loss of LV capture was simulated by RV-only pacing. The algorithm always classified LV or biventricular (BV) pacing with AV delays ≤60% of patient's intrinsic AV delay as effective pacing. As AV delays increased, the percentage of beats classified as effective LV pacing decreased. Algorithm results were compared against a classification truth based on correlation coefficients between paced QRS complexes and intrinsic rhythm QRS templates from three surface ECG leads. An average correlation >0.9 defined a classification truth of ineffective pacing. Compared against the classification truth, the algorithm correctly classified 98.2% (3240/3300) effective LV pacing beats, 75.8% (561/740) of pseudofusion beats, and 100% (540/540) of beats with loss of LV capture. CONCLUSION: A device-based algorithm for beat-by-beat monitoring of effective LV pacing is feasible.

N2  - The high temporal and intensity resolution of modern accelerometers gives the  opportunity of detecting even tiny body movements via motion-based sensors. In this paper, we demonstrate and evaluate an approach to identify pulse waves and heartbeats from acceleration data of the human wrist during sleep. Specifically, we have recorded simultaneously full-night polysomnography and 3d wrist actigraphy data of 363 subjects during one night in a clinical sleep laboratory. The acceleration data was segmented and cleaned, excluding body movements and separating episodes with different sleep positions. Then, we applied a bandpass filter and a Hilbert transform to uncover the pulse wave signal, which worked well for an average duration of 1.7 h per subject. We found that 81 percent of the detected pulse wave intervals could be correctly associated with the R peak intervals from independently recorded ECGs and obtained a median Pearson cross-correlation of 0.94. While the low-frequency components of both signals were practically identical, the high-frequency component of the pulse wave interval time series was increased, indicating a respiratory modulation of pulse transit times, probably as an additional contribution to respiratory sinus arrhythmia. Our approach could be used to obtain long-term nocturnal heartbeat interval time series and pulse wave signals from wrist-worn accelerometers without the need of recording ECG or photoplethysmography. This is particularly useful for an ambulatory monitoring of high-risk cardiac patients as well as for assessing cardiac dynamics in large cohort studies solely with accelerometer devices that are already used for activity tracking and sleep pattern analysis.

N2  - The Poincaré plot emerges as an effective tool for assessing cardiovascular  autonomic regulation. It displays nonlinear characteristics of heart rate variability (HRV) from electrocardiographic (ECG) recordings and gives a global view of the long range of ECG signals. In the telemedicine or computer-aided diagnosis system, it would offer significant auxiliary information for diagnosis if the patterns of the Poincaré plots can be automatically classified. Therefore, we developed an automatic classification system to distinguish five geometric patterns of the Poincaré plots from four types of cardiac arrhythmias. The statistics features are designed on measurements and an ensemble classifier of three types of neural networks is proposed. Aiming at the difficulty to set a proper threshold for classifying the multiple categories, the threshold selection strategy is analyzed. 24 h ECG monitoring recordings from 674 patients, which have four types of cardiac arrhythmias, are adopted for recognition. For comparison, Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers with linear and Gaussian kernels are also applied. The experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of the extracted features and the better performance of the designed classifier. Our study can be applied to diagnose the corresponding sinus rhythm and arrhythmia substrates disease automatically in the telemedicine and computer-aided diagnosis system.

N2  - Sleep apnea (SA) is the most common respiratory sleep disorder, leading to some  serious neurological and cardiovascular diseases if left untreated. The diagnosis of SA is traditionally made using Polysomnography (PSG). However, this method requires many electrodes and wires, as well as an expert to monitor the test. Several researchers have proposed instead using a single channel signal for SA diagnosis. Among these options, the ECG signal is one of the most physiologically relevant signals of SA occurrence, and one that can be easily recorded using a wearable device. However, existing ECG signal-based methods mainly use features (i.e. frequency domain, time domain, and other nonlinear features) acquired from ECG and its derived signals in order to construct the model. This requires researchers to have rich experience in ECG, which is not common. A convolutional neural network (CNN) is a kind of deep neural network that can automatically learn effective feature representation from training data and has been successfully applied in many fields. Meanwhile, most studies have not considered the impact of adjacent segments on SA detection. Therefore, in this study, we propose a modified LeNet-5 convolutional neural network with adjacent segments for SA detection. Our experimental results show that our proposed method is useful for SA detection, and achieves better or comparable results when compared with traditional machine learning methods.

N2  - The amount of coronary artery calcification (CAC) is a strong and independent  predictor of cardiovascular events. We present a system that automatically quantifies total patient and per coronary artery CAC in non-contrast-enhanced, ECG-triggered cardiac CT. The system identifies candidate calcifications that cannot be automatically labeled with high certainty and optionally presents these to an expert for review. Candidates were extracted by intensity-based thresholding and described by location features derived from estimated coronary artery positions, as well as size, shape and intensity features. Next, a two-class classifier distinguished between coronary calcifications and negatives or a multiclass classifier labeled CAC per coronary artery. Candidates that could not be labeled with high certainty were identified by entropy-based ambiguity detection and presented to an expert for review and possible relabeling. The system was evaluated with 530 test images. Using the two-class classifier, the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) between reference and automatically determined total patient CAC volume was 0.95. Using the multiclass classifier, the ICC between reference and automatically determined per artery CAC volume was 0.98 (LAD), 0.69 (LCX), and 0.95 (RCA). In 49% of CTs, no ambiguous candidates were identified, while review of the remaining CTs increased the ICC for total patient CAC volume to 1.00, and per artery CAC volume to 1.00 (LAD), 0.95 (LCX), and 0.99 (RCA). In conclusion, CAC can be automatically identified in non-contrast-enhanced ECG-triggered cardiac CT. Ambiguity detection with expert review may enable the application of automatic CAC scoring in the clinic with a performance comparable to that of a human expert.

N2  - Analysis of heart rate variability (HRV) by nonlinear approaches has been gaining  interest due to their ability to extract additional information from heart rate (HR) dynamics that are not detectable by traditional approaches. Nevertheless, the physiological interpretation of nonlinear approaches remains unclear. Therefore, we propose long-term (60 min) protocols involving selective blockade of cardiac autonomic receptors to investigate the contribution of sympathetic and parasympathetic function upon nonlinear dynamics of HRV. Conscious male Wistar rats had their electrocardiogram (ECG) recorded under three distinct conditions: basal, selective (atenolol or atropine), or combined (atenolol plus atropine) pharmacological blockade of autonomic muscarinic or β(1)-adrenergic receptors. Time series of RR interval were assessed by multiscale entropy (MSE) and detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA). Entropy over short (1 to 5, MSE(1-5)) and long (6 to 30, MSE(6-30)) time scales was computed, as well as DFA scaling exponents at short (α(short), 5 ≤ n ≤ 15), mid (α(mid), 30 ≤ n ≤ 200), and long (α(long), 200 ≤ n ≤ 1,700) window sizes. The results show that MSE(1-5) is reduced under atropine blockade and MSE(6-30) is reduced under atropine, atenolol, or combined blockade. In addition, while atropine expressed its maximal effect at scale six, the effect of atenolol on MSE increased with scale. For DFA, α(short) decreased during atenolol blockade, while the α(mid) increased under atropine blockade. Double blockade decreased α(short) and increased α(long) Results with surrogate data show that the dynamics during combined blockade is not random. In summary, sympathetic and vagal control differently affect entropy (MSE) and fractal properties (DFA) of HRV. These findings are important to guide future studies.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Although multiscale entropy (MSE) and detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) are recognizably useful prognostic/diagnostic methods, their physiological interpretation remains unclear. The present study clarifies the effect of the cardiac autonomic control on MSE and DFA, assessed during long periods (1 h). These findings are important to help the interpretation of future studies.

N2  - Efficient unsupervised algorithms for the detection of patterns in time series data,  often called motifs, have been used in many applications, such as identifying words in different languages, detecting anomalies in ECG readings, and finding similarities between images. We present a process that creates a personalized multivariate time series representation a Multivariate Time Series Amalgam (MTSA) of physiological data and laboratory results that physicians can visually interpret. We then apply a technique that has demonstrated success with the interpretation of univariate data, named Symbolic Aggregate Approximation (SAX), to visualize patterns in the MTSAs that may differentiate between medical conditions such as renal and respiratory failure.

N2  - We aimed at reducing alarm fatigue in neonatal intensive care units by developing a  model using machine learning for the early prediction of critical cardiorespiratory alarms. During this study in over 34,000 patient monitoring hours in 55 infants 278,000 advisory (yellow) and 70,000 critical (red) alarms occurred. Vital signs including the heart rate, breathing rate, and oxygen saturation were obtained at a sampling frequency of 1 Hz while heart rate variability was calculated by processing the ECG - both were used for feature development and for predicting alarms. Yellow alarms that were followed by at least one red alarm within a short post-alarm window constituted the case-cohort while the remaining yellow alarms constituted the control cohort. For analysis, the case and control cohorts, stratified by proportion, were split into training (80%) and test sets (20%). Classifiers based on decision trees were used to predict, at the moment the yellow alarm occurred, whether a red alarm(s) would shortly follow. The best performing classifier used data from the 2-min window before the occurrence of the yellow alarm and could predict 26% of the red alarms in advance (18.4s, median), at the expense of 7% additional red alarms. These results indicate that based on predictive monitoring of critical alarms, nurses can be provided a longer window of opportunity for preemptive clinical action. Further, such as algorithm can be safely implemented as alarms that are not algorithmically predicted can still be generated upon the usual breach of the threshold, as in current clinical practice.

N2  - In this paper, we propose a generalized functional linear regression model for a  binary outcome indicating the presence/absence of a cardiac disease with multivariate functional data among the relevant predictors. In particular, the motivating aim is the analysis of electrocardiographic traces of patients whose pre-hospital electrocardiogram (ECG) has been sent to 118 Dispatch Center of Milan (the Italian free-toll number for emergencies) by life support personnel of the basic rescue units. The statistical analysis starts with a preprocessing of ECGs treated as multivariate functional data. The signals are reconstructed from noisy observations. The biological variability is then removed by a nonlinear registration procedure based on landmarks. Thus, in order to perform a data-driven dimensional reduction, a multivariate functional principal component analysis is carried out on the variance-covariance matrix of the reconstructed and registered ECGs and their first derivatives. We use the scores of the Principal Components decomposition as covariates in a generalized linear model to predict the presence of the disease in a new patient. Hence, a new semi-automatic diagnostic procedure is proposed to estimate the risk of infarction (in the case of interest, the probability of being affected by Left Bundle Brunch Block). The performance of this classification method is evaluated and compared with other methods proposed in literature. Finally, the robustness of the procedure is checked via leave-j-out techniques.

N2  - There are now domains where information is recorded over a period of time, leading  to sequences of data known as time series. In many domains, like medicine, time series analysis requires to focus on certain regions of interest, known as events, rather than analyzing the whole time series. In this paper, we propose a framework for knowledge discovery in both one-dimensional and multidimensional time series containing events. We show how our approach can be used to classify medical time series by means of a process that identifies events in time series, generates time series reference models of representative events and compares two time series by analyzing the events they have in common. We have applied our framework on time series generated in the areas of electroencephalography (EEG) and stabilometry. Framework performance was evaluated in terms of classification accuracy, and the results confirmed that the proposed schema has potential for classifying EEG and stabilometric signals. The proposed framework is useful for discovering knowledge from medical time series containing events, such as stabilometric and electroencephalographic time series. These results would be equally applicable to other medical domains generating iconographic time series, such as, for example, electrocardiography (ECG).

N2  - Cardiovascular diseases are projected to remain the single leading cause of death  globally. Timely diagnosis and treatment of these diseases are crucial to prevent death and dangerous complications. One of the important tools in early diagnosis of arrhythmias is analysis of electrocardiograms (ECGs) obtained from ambulatory long-term recordings. The design of novel patch-type ECG recorders has increased the accessibility of these long-term recordings. In many applications, it is furthermore an advantage for these devices that the recorded ECGs can be analyzed automatically in real time. The purpose of this study was therefore to design a novel algorithm for automatic heart beat detection, and embed the algorithm in the CE marked ePatch heart monitor. The algorithm is based on a novel cascade of computationally efficient filters, optimized adaptive thresholding, and a refined search back mechanism. The design and optimization of the algorithm was performed on two different databases: The MIT-BIH arrhythmia database ([Formula: see text]%, [Formula: see text]) and a private ePatch training database ([Formula: see text]%, [Formula: see text]%). The offline validation was conducted on the European ST-T database ([Formula: see text]%, [Formula: see text]%). Finally, a double-blinded validation of the embedded algorithm was conducted on a private ePatch validation database ([Formula: see text]%, [Formula: see text]%). The algorithm was thus validated with high clinical performance on more than 300 ECG records from 189 different subjects with a high number of different abnormal beat morphologies. This demonstrates the strengths of the algorithm, and the potential for this embedded algorithm to improve the possibilities of early diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular diseases.

N2  - The role of automatic electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis in clinical practice is  limited by the accuracy of existing models. Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are models composed of stacked transformations that learn tasks by examples. This technology has recently achieved striking success in a variety of task and there are great expectations on how it might improve clinical practice. Here we present a DNN model trained in a dataset with more than 2 million labeled exams analyzed by the Telehealth Network of Minas Gerais and collected under the scope of the CODE (Clinical Outcomes in Digital Electrocardiology) study. The DNN outperform cardiology resident medical doctors in recognizing 6 types of abnormalities in 12-lead ECG recordings, with F1 scores above 80% and specificity over 99%. These results indicate ECG analysis based on DNNs, previously studied in a single-lead setup, generalizes well to 12-lead exams, taking the technology closer to the standard clinical practice.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is characterized by markedly increased  sympathetic outflow that contributes to increased cardiovascular mortality in these patients. The central sympatholytic drug moxonidine (MOX) has been shown to reduce muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) in initial stages of chronic kidney disease; however, the effects in ESRD are not known. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that low-dose MOX causes sustained decreases in sympathetic outflow in ESRD patients. DESIGN AND METHODS: Twenty-three ESRD patients (mean age 46.4 +/- 16 years, 14 men, seven women, no diabetic patients) were randomized to a daily treatment of 0.3 mg MOX or placebo (PLA) in addition to pre-existing antihypertensive therapy. At baseline and after 1 and 6 months of treatment, heart rate (HR, ECG), blood pressure (mean arterial pressure, automatic sphygmanometer), calf blood flow (CBF, venous occlusion plethysmography), muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) (microneurography at the peroneal nerve) were measured. Data are mean +/- SEM. RESULTS: MOX acutely decreased MSNA within 2 h after oral intake (from 45 +/- 3.7 to 35 +/- 3.9 bursts/min, P < 0.05). This decrease was sustained over 6 months (MSNA 45 +/- 3.7, 35 +/- 4.6, 33 +/- 4.5 bursts/min at 0, 1 and 6 months, P < 0.05). PLA had no effect. Neither MOX nor PLA resulted in any significant acute or long-term changes in HR, MAP or CBF. CONCLUSIONS: In ESRD patients, low-dose MOX produced sustained and substantial reductions in sympathetic outflow without hemodynamically compromising them. We suggest that the inhibition of central sympathetic outflow may improve cardiovascular prognosis in ESRD.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The manufacturer has developed a new ECG screening tool to determine  eligibility for the subcutaneous ICD (S-ICD), the "automatic screening tool" (AST), which may render manual ECG-screening unnecessary. The aim of the study was to determine the eligibility for the S-ICD using two methods (manual ECG-screening versus AST) in different patient categories including patients with cardiomyopathy, congenital heart disease and inherited primary arrhythmia syndrome. METHODS: We prospectively evaluated the ECG suitability for an S-ICD in consecutive patients at our outpatient clinic between February and June 2017. The primary endpoint of the study was ECG eligibility defined as at least 1 successful vector in both supine and sitting postures. RESULTS: A total of 254 patients (167 men; mean age 45 ± 16 years) were screened using both methods. Overall, there was a high ECG eligibility using either method (93% versus 92%, P = 0.45). Overall agreement between both methods was 94%. Patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) more often had a failed screening test using either test in comparison to the patients without HCM (manual: odds ratio [OR] 3.3, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2-9.3, P = 0.02; AST: OR 3.0, 95% CI 1.2-7.6, P = 0.02). CONCLUSION: AST showed a high agreement with manual ECG-screening for S-ICD. Overall there was a high ECG eligibility for S-ICD, although patients with HCM had a lower passing rate irrespective of the screening method.

N2  - It's necessary to interrupt cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) for a reliable  automatic external defibrillator (AED) rhythm analysis, because the mechanical activity from the chest compressions introduces artifacts in the electrocardiogram (ECG) that substantially lower the capacity of an AED to judge cardio-electric rhythm. However, repeated interruptions of compression will reduce the quality of CPR, which in turn affect the prognosis of patients with cardiac arrest (CA). In order to improve the quality of CPR, reduce the interruptions of chest compression and implement accurate defibrillation, people have made many efforts on identifying ECG rhythm in CPR. The studies can be grouped into two broad categories: those based on the artificial mixture of ECG data and CPR artifacts and those based on CA data recorded during CPR. This article introduced researches for rhythm recognition in CPR, including sources and characteristics of CPR artifacts, methods of rhythm analysis, and provided a basis for the study of how to improve the accuracy of cardio-electric rhythm recognition.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a serious medical condition with increasing prevalence and  high mortality. The role of the autonomic nervous system in pathophysiology of sepsis has been increasingly researched. The objective of this study is to evaluate the Heart rate variability (HRV) as a predictor of mortality in septic patients. METHODS: This was a prospective cohort of patients diagnosed with sepsis. Patient recruitment was carried out at ICU in tertiary university hospital between March 2012 and February 2014. Clinical data and laboratory exams were collected at admission. Each patient underwent a 20-minute Holter and a 24-hour Holter on the first day of enrollment. The primary outcome was the 28-day all-cause mortality. RESULTS: A total of 63 patients were included. Patients were categorized into nonsurvivor group (n = 16) or survivor group (n = 47) depending on this endpoint. Survivors were younger (48.6 years vs. 63.0 years), had better renal function and lower values in severity scores (APACHE II and SOFA) compared to nonsurvivors. In the 20-minute Holter, SDNN, Total Power, VLF Power, LF Power and LF/HF of nonsurvivors were significantly lower than those of survivors (p = <0.001, p = 0.003, p = 0.002, p = 0.006, p = 0.009 respectively). ROC curve of SDNN was built, showing area under the curve of 0.772 (0.638-0.906) for mortality. The value of 17ms was chosen as best SDNN cutoff to discriminate survivors and nonsurvivors. In the Cox proportional regression, adjusted for SOFA score and for APACHE II, a SDNN ≤ 17ms was associated with a greater risk of death, with hazard ratios of 6.3 (1.4-28.0; p = 0.015) and 5.5 (1,2-24,8; p = 0.027), respectively. The addition of the dichotomized SDNN to the SOFA model reduced AIC and increased the concordance statistic and the R2, indicating that predictive power of the SDNN + SOFA model is better than predictive power of SOFA only. CONCLUSIONS: Several HRV parameters are reduced in nonsurviving septic patients. SDNN ≤17 is a risk factor for death in septic patients, even after adjusting for severity scores.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Although atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most commonly encountered  arrhythmia, some of the properties make its detection challenging. In daily practice, underdiagnosis can lead to less effective treatment in prevention of stroke. Based on data from studies on treatment of AF, more intensive follow-up strategies, including 7-day Holter recording, 30-day event recording, and even implantable cardiac monitoring devices, are suggested. The study purpose is to evaluate the performance of a continuous single-channel loop recorder with automatic AF detection and transtelephonic electrocardiogram (ECG) transmission capabilities. METHODS AND RESULTS: A consecutive cohort of 153 patients admitted to the stroke unit with a presumptive diagnosis of ischemic cerebrovascular accident was screened for AF. Twenty-four-hour rhythm observation was performed using a single-channel external loop recorder (ELR) configured for automated AF detection. A total of 45 patients with a known history of AF, AF on the admission ECG, or incomplete registrations were excluded. Extensive additional frequency-based settings were used to establish a reference registration. In total, 2923 recordings were transmitted. We evaluated all events, of which 1190 were designated by the device as AF. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV for identifying AF using the ELR were, respectively, 93%, 51%, 5%, and 99%. CONCLUSIONS: In this ELR validation study, the dedicated AF detection algorithm showed to be highly sensitive but not specific for AF. Applicability of an ELR might be limited for efficacious detection of AF, as manual verification is mandatory for a vast amount of recordings.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the diagnostic performance of a UK National Institute for  Health and Care Excellence-recommended automatic oscillometric blood pressure (BP) measurement device incorporated with an atrial fibrillation (AF) detection algorithm (Microlife WatchBP Home A) for real-world AF screening in a primary healthcare setting. SETTING: Primary healthcare setting in Hong Kong. INTERVENTIONS: This was a prospective AF screening study carried out between 1 September 2014 and 14 January 2015. The Microlife device was evaluated for AF detection and compared with a reference standard of lead-I ECG. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Diagnostic performance of Microlife for AF detection. RESULTS: 5969 patients (mean age: 67.2±11.0 years; 53.9% female) were recruited. The mean CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc ( C : congestive heart failure [1 point]; H : hypertension [1 point]; A(2) : age 65-74 years [1 point] and age ≥75 years [2 points]; D : diabetes mellitus [1 point]; S : prior stroke or transient ischemic attack [2 points]; VA : vascular disease [1 point]; and Sc : sex category [female] [1 point])score was 2.8±1.3. AF was diagnosed in 72 patients (1.21%) and confirmed by a 12-lead ECG. The Microlife device correctly identified AF in 58 patients and produced 79 false-positives. The corresponding sensitivity and specificity for AF detection were 80.6% (95% CI 69.5 to 88.9) and 98.7% (95% CI 98.3 to 98.9), respectively. Among patients with a false-positive by the Microlife device, 30.4% had sinus rhythm, 35.4% had sinus arrhythmia and 29.1% exhibited premature atrial complexes. With the low prevalence of AF in this population, the positive and negative predictive values of Microlife device for AF detection were 42.4% (95% CI 34.0 to 51.2) and 99.8% (95% CI 99.6 to 99.9), respectively. The overall diagnostic performance of Microlife device to detect AF as determined by area under the curves was 0.90 (95% CI 0.89 to 0.90). CONCLUSIONS: In the primary care setting, Microlife WatchBP Home was an effective means to screen for AF, with a reasonable sensitivity of 80.6% and a high negative predictive value of 99.8%, in addition to its routine function of BP measurement. In a younger patient population aged <65 years with a lower prevalence of AF, Microlife WatchBP Home A demonstrated a similar diagnostic accuracy.

N2  - This article presents a comprehensive system for automatic heart rate (HR)  detection. The system is robust and resistant to disturbances (noise, interferences, artifacts) occurring mainly during epileptic seizures. ECG signal filtration (IIR) and normalization due to skewness and standard deviation were used as preprocessing steps. A key element of the system is a reference QRS complex pattern calculated individually for each ECG recording. Next, a cross-correlation of the reference QRS pattern with short, normalized ECG windows is calculated and the maxima of the correlation are found (R-wave locations). Determination of the RR intervals makes possible calculation of heart rate changes and also heart rate variability (HRV). The algorithm was tested using a simulation in which a noise of an amplitude several times higher than ECG standard deviation levels was added. The proposed algorithm is characterized by high QRS detection accuracy, and high sensitivity and specificity. The algorithm proved to be useful in clinical practice, where it was used to automatically determine HR for ECG signals recorded before and during 58 focal seizures in 56 adult patients with intractable temporal lobe epilepsy.

N2  - Developing a mathematical model for the artificial generation of electrocardiogram  (ECG) signals is a subject that has been widely investigated. One of the challenges is to generate ECG signals with a wide range of waveforms, power spectra and variations in heart rate variability (HRV)--all of which are important indexes of human heart functions. In this paper we present a comprehensive model for generating such artificial ECG signals. We incorporate into our model the effects of respiratory sinus arrhythmia, Mayer waves and the important very low-frequency component in the power spectrum of HRV. We use a new modified Zeeman model for generating the time series for HRV, and a single cycle of ECG is produced by using a simple neural network. The importance of the work is the model's ability to produce artificial ECG signals that resemble experimental recordings under various physiological conditions. As such the model provides a useful tool to simulate and analyse the main characteristics of ECG, such as its power spectrum and HRV under different conditions. Potential applications of this model include using the generated ECG as a flexible signal source to assess the effectiveness of a diagnostic ECG signal-processing device.

In this paper, a NISHIJIN e-textile sensor belt prototype designed for ambulatory measurement (pre-hospital 12-lead ECG measurement) was tested on twenty volunteers. The recorded data was evaluated through the result of commercial automatic ECG analyzer. The obtained results are almost equivalent with the ones obtained through conventional ECG electrodes. However, the results suggest slight modification of the prototype.

N2  - Artifacts in an electrocardiogram (ECG) due to electrode misplacement can lead to  wrong diagnoses. Various computer methods have been developed for automatic detection of electrode misplacement. Here we reviewed and compared the performance of two algorithms with the highest accuracies on several databases from PhysioNet. These algorithms were implemented into four models. For clean ECG records with clearly distinguishable waves, the best model produced excellent accuracies (> = 98.4%) for all misplacements except the LA/LL interchange (87.4%). However, the accuracies were significantly lower for records with noise and arrhythmias. Moreover, when the algorithms were tested on a database that was independent from the training database, the accuracies may be poor. For the worst scenario, the best accuracies for different types of misplacements ranged from 36.1% to 78.4%. A large number of ECGs of various qualities and pathological conditions are collected every day. To improve the quality of health care, the results of this paper call for more robust and accurate algorithms for automatic detection of electrode misplacement, which should be developed and tested using a database of extensive ECG records.

N2  - Electrocardiography (ECG) is a mandatory standard for monitoring electrical activity  of the heart in many clinical settings such as intensive care and emergency units. However, in situations wherein the skin is damaged, such as acute burn injuries, it is impossible to efficiently attach electrodes to the skin. In this study, we developed a non-contact cardiac monitoring system using a 24-GHz medical radar for directly measuring the beat-to-beat heart mechanical activity at a distance from a subject. The heart rate variability (HRV) was analysed using an autoregressive model (AR) from the measured beat-to-beat intervals during a head-up tilt test. To investigate the feasibility of the proposed system, we compared medical radar and ECG recording by using Lin's correlation coefficient and Bland-Altman analysis, which showed a negligible mean difference from the substantial agreement of Lin's correlation coefficient of 0.9 between the radar and ECG. The non-contact radar clearly monitored dynamic changes in HRV indices induced by the head-up tilt test. This type of non-contact HRV-sensing technique as an alternative approach has significant potential for advancing personal healthcare in both clinical and out-of-hospital settings.

N2  - HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVE: Prolonged QT interval is an index of propensity for dangerous  ventricular tachyarrhythmias. The aim of this article is to establish an automatic algorithm for QT interval measurement. METHOD: The proposed method is based on the continuous wavelet transform. In this method, the concepts of the rescaled wavelet coefficients and dominant scales of the electrocardiogram (ECG) components are used to perform detection of ECG characteristic points. A new concept of rescaled maximum energy density is introduced so as to perform the estimation of the QT interval. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: We have applied the algorithm to the PTB database of the Physiobank∖Physionet in lead II. Then, the results were evaluated using pertinent reference QT. The criterion used for evaluation of the method's performance is the root mean square (RMS) error. The method approached the RMS error of 27.89 ms for 549 subjects. The proposed method is fast, simple and is applicable to a wide range of ECG cardio cycle morphologies.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) has been associated with an  increased risk of cardiovascular disease in later life. The regularity mechanism of cardiovascular system is under the control of autonomic nervous system (ANS). The non-optimal fetal growth may alter the development of the ANS and this appears to persist in later life. The aim of the present work is to analyse the synergic activity of the ANS in normal and growth restricted children. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Heart rate variability analysis from 24 h ECG recordings of 70 children between 9 and 10 years old, normal and IUGR was performed using linear and non-linear time series analysis techniques. CONCLUSION: The HRV parameters showed no significant difference between normal and IUGR children. Low birth weight and its association with development of the cardiovascular system and its control have been extensively studied. In order to investigate the effect of low birth weight on HRV parameters, the IUGR children were further divided into two groups: IUGR-1 (birth weight<2.50 kg) and IUGR-2 (birth weight≥2.50 kg). The results demonstrated that most of the HRV measures showed significant differences between normal versus IUGR-1 as well as IUGR-1 versus IUGR-2 groups. The effect of gender on HRV measures was also examined and we noticed that girls had lower HRV than boys.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Although a Brugada-type electrocardiogram (ECG) is occasionally detected  in mass health screening examinations in apparently healthy individuals, the automatic computerized diagnostic criteria for Brugada-type ECGs have not been established. OBJECTIVE: This study was performed to establish the criteria for the computerized diagnosis of Brugada-type ECGs and to evaluate their diagnostic accuracy. METHODS: We examined the ECG parameters in leads V1 to V3 in patients with Brugada syndrome and cases with right bundle branch block. Based on the above parameters, we classified the ECGs into 3 types of Brugada-type ECGs, and the conditions for defining each type were explored as the diagnostic criteria. The diagnostic effectiveness of the proposed criteria was assessed using 548 ECGs from 49 cases with Brugada-type ECGs and the recordings from 192,673 cases (36,674 adults and 155,999 school children) obtained from their annual health examinations. RESULTS: The Brugada-type ST-segment elevation in V1 to V3 was classified into 3 types, types 1, 2/3, and a suggestive Brugada ECG (type S). The automatic diagnostic criteria for each type were established by the J-point amplitude, ST-segment elevation with its amplitude and configuration, as well as the T-wave morphology in leads V1 to V3. CONCLUSION: The proposed criteria demonstrated a reasonable accuracy (type 1: 91.9%, type 2/3: 86.2%, type S: 76.2%) for diagnosing Brugada-type ECG in comparison to the macroscopic diagnosis by experienced observers. Moreover, the automatic criteria had a comparable detection rate (0.6% in adults, 0.16% in children) of Brugada-type ECGs to the macroscopic inspection in the health screening examinations.

N2  - BACKGROUND: ECG cable interchange can generate erroneous diagnoses. For algorithms  detecting ECG cable interchange, high specificity is required to maintain a low total false positive rate because the prevalence of interchange is low. In this study, we propose and evaluate an improved algorithm for automatic detection and classification of ECG cable interchange. METHOD: The algorithm was developed by using both ECG morphology information and redundancy information. ECG morphology features included QRS-T and P-wave amplitude, frontal axis and clockwise vector loop rotation. The redundancy features were derived based on the EASI™ lead system transformation. The classification was implemented using linear support vector machine. The development database came from multiple sources including both normal subjects and cardiac patients. An independent database was used to test the algorithm performance. Common cable interchanges were simulated by swapping either limb cables or precordial cables. RESULTS: For the whole validation database, the overall sensitivity and specificity for detecting precordial cable interchange were 56.5% and 99.9%, and the sensitivity and specificity for detecting limb cable interchange (excluding left arm-left leg interchange) were 93.8% and 99.9%. Defining precordial cable interchange or limb cable interchange as a single positive event, the total false positive rate was 0.7%. When the algorithm was designed for higher sensitivity, the sensitivity for detecting precordial cable interchange increased to 74.6% and the total false positive rate increased to 2.7%, while the sensitivity for detecting limb cable interchange was maintained at 93.8%. The low total false positive rate was maintained at 0.6% for the more abnormal subset of the validation database including only hypertrophy and infarction patients. CONCLUSION: The proposed algorithm can detect and classify ECG cable interchanges with high specificity and low total false positive rate, at the cost of decreased sensitivity for certain precordial cable interchanges. The algorithm could also be configured for higher sensitivity for different applications where a lower specificity can be tolerated.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: We propose a heartbeat-based end-to-end classification of arrhythmias to  improve the classification performance for supraventricular ectopic beat (SVEB) and ventricular ectopic beat (VEB). METHODS: The ECG signals were preprocessed by heartbeat segmentation and heartbeat alignment. An arrhythmia classifier was constructed based on convolutional neural network, and the proposed loss function was used to train the classifier. RESULTS: The proposed algorithm was verified on MIT-BIH arrhythmia database. The AUC of the proposed loss function for SVEB and VEB reached 0.77 and 0.98, respectively. With the first 5 min segment as the local data, the diagnostic sensitivities for SVEB and VEB were 78.28% and 98.88%, respectively; when 0, 50, 100, and 150 samples were used as the local data, the diagnostic sensitivities for SVEB and VEB reached 82.25% and 93.23%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed method effectively reduces the negative impact of class-imbalance and improves the diagnostic sensitivities for SVEB and VEB, and thus provides a new solution for automatic arrhythmia classification.

N2  - The origin of heart rate variability (HRV) is largely in parasympathetic activity.  The direct influence of sympathetic activity and other control mechanisms, especially at an increased HR, is not well understood. The objectives of the study were to investigate the influence of increasing HR on the properties of heartbeat interval (RR) series in young healthy subjects. ECG was recorded in 9 trained and 11 untrained young men during supine rest, standing, incremental running exercise and relaxation. During exercise, a breath-to-breath gas exchange was monitored. The RR time series analysis included the spectral analysis, detrended fluctuations analysis method and sample entropy (SampEn) calculation. During exercise, spectral powers were reduced dramatically in both groups. The dependence of short-term scaling exponent (alpha(1)) on the RR included a characteristic maximum, while SampEn for the same value of the RR had a minimum. The value of HR corresponding to the maximum of alpha(1) and minimum of SampEn (IHR) corresponded to the intrinsic HR obtained by an autonomic blockade. In trained subjects, the curves alpha(1) versus RR and SampEn versus RR were moved toward larger RR, compared with control. For HR values higher than IHR, alpha(1) decreased and SampEn increased. These results reveal that the complexity of the heart rhythm above intrinsic HR decreases with an increase in HR. We suggest that at the highest HR intrinsic heart control is reflected in the heart rhythm. We point out the possibility of developing a new non-invasive method for the determination of intrinsic HR from the curve alpha(1) versus RR.

N2  - Octreotide is a somatostatin analogue used to control upper gastrointestinal  bleeding. We report a case of a patient with no significant cardiac history who had multiple asystolic events during an octreotide infusion at a relatively low dose. Although octreotide leading to bradycardia and heart block has been documented in several case reports, to our knowledge, octreotide-associated asystole has not been described. It is pertinent that physicians must be aware of this significant cardiac effect for vigilant cardiac monitoring and management, preferably in an intensive care setting. Furthermore, this suggests that although dose- and route-related effects have been described, some individuals may be susceptible at low doses, even in the absence of heart disease. There were no further recurrences after the drug was discontinued.

N2  - Effective regulation of emotions requires the ability to voluntarily manage  attention, i.e. attentional control (AC), which has been related to heart rate variability and vagal tone in laboratory based research. In this study, we calculated the correlation dimension (CD), the fractal-like properties (scaling exponents ?1 and ?2, and fractal dimension) and the sample entropy of heart rate time series obtained from ECG recordings (4 hours long each) taken from a sample of healthy students (n=47) during everyday activities. AC was assessed through a self-reported questionnaire. As expected, a linear positive correlation was found between AC scores and CD and entropy, but no associations were found between AC and ?1 and fractal dimension. The association between AC and ?2 was negative and marginally significant. No associations were found between AC and linear heart rate variability measures. These results show that nonlinear measures of long, everyday life, heart rate time series may provide useful information about the AC ability of healthy students.

N2  - PURPOSE: Physiologic monitors are plagued with alarms that create a cacophony of  sounds and visual alerts causing "alarm fatigue" which creates an unsafe patient environment because a life-threatening event may be missed in this milieu of sensory overload. Using a state-of-the-art technology acquisition infrastructure, all monitor data including 7 ECG leads, all pressure, SpO(2), and respiration waveforms as well as user settings and alarms were stored on 461 adults treated in intensive care units. Using a well-defined alarm annotation protocol, nurse scientists with 95% inter-rater reliability annotated 12,671 arrhythmia alarms. RESULTS: A total of 2,558,760 unique alarms occurred in the 31-day study period: arrhythmia, 1,154,201; parameter, 612,927; technical, 791,632. There were 381,560 audible alarms for an audible alarm burden of 187/bed/day. 88.8% of the 12,671 annotated arrhythmia alarms were false positives. Conditions causing excessive alarms included inappropriate alarm settings, persistent atrial fibrillation, and non-actionable events such as PVC's and brief spikes in ST segments. Low amplitude QRS complexes in some, but not all available ECG leads caused undercounting and false arrhythmia alarms. Wide QRS complexes due to bundle branch block or ventricular pacemaker rhythm caused false alarms. 93% of the 168 true ventricular tachycardia alarms were not sustained long enough to warrant treatment. DISCUSSION: The excessive number of physiologic monitor alarms is a complex interplay of inappropriate user settings, patient conditions, and algorithm deficiencies. Device solutions should focus on use of all available ECG leads to identify non-artifact leads and leads with adequate QRS amplitude. Devices should provide prompts to aide in more appropriate tailoring of alarm settings to individual patients. Atrial fibrillation alarms should be limited to new onset and termination of the arrhythmia and delays for ST-segment and other parameter alarms should be configurable. Because computer devices are more reliable than humans, an opportunity exists to improve physiologic monitoring and reduce alarm fatigue.

N2  - Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia associated with a  major economic burden for the society. Automatic detection of AF in long term recordings can efficiently assist in early diagnosis and management of comorbidities associated with AF. This study presents a novel approach for AF detection based on Inter Beat Intervals (IBI) extracted from long term electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings. Five time-domain features are extracted from the IBIs and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used for classification. The results are compared to a state of the art algorithm based on raw ECG. Both algorithms are evaluated on the MIT-BIH Atrial Fibrillation database resulting in equally high classification performance (Sensitivity ≥ 95%). The proposed approach requires detection of R-peaks in the ECG signal but allows for significantly reduced computation time without loss of performance.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The goal of this study was to compare the time series predictors of  beat-to-beat variability in repolarization in healthy individuals. METHODS: Spatial QRS- and T-vector amplitudes, spatial QRS-T, RR' and TT' angles, RR' and QT intervals, and QRS- and T-loop roundness were measured on 453 consecutive sinus beats in 168 healthy subjects (mean age 39.8±15.6years; 50% men; 93% white). Panel time-series regression models were adjusted by age, sex, and race. Appropriate time series of ECG metrics served as predictors and outcomes. RESULTS: Increase in T-loop roundness index by 0.1 was associated with 1.1° (95%CI 0.9-2.2; P=0.048) increase in corresponding TT' angle. One unit increase in a respiration index was associated with 4ms (95%CI 0.6-7.0; P=0.021) increase in QT interval. CONCLUSIONS: Spatial TT' angle and beat-to-beat variability in T-loop roundness represent intrinsic measures of repolarization variability. QT interval variability characterizes the effect of respiration and heart rate variability.

N2  - Heart rate variability (HRV) analysis is widely used to investigate the autonomic  regulation of the cardiovascular system. HRV is often analyzed using RR time series, which can be affected by different types of artifacts. Although there are several artifact correction methods, there is no study that compares their performances in actual experimental contexts. This work aimed to evaluate the impact of different artifact correction methods on several HRV parameters. Initially, 36 ECG recordings of control rats or rats with heart failure or hypertension were analyzed to characterize artifact occurrence rates and distributions, to be mimicked in simulations. After a rigorous analysis, only 16 recordings ( n = 16) with artifact-free segments of at least 10,000 beats were selected. RR interval losses were then simulated in the artifact-free (reference) time series according to real observations. Correction methods applied to simulated series were deletion, linear interpolation, cubic spline interpolation, modified moving average window, and nonlinear predictive interpolation. Linear (time- and frequency-domain) and nonlinear HRV parameters were calculated from corrupted-corrected time series, as well as for reference series to evaluate the accuracy of each correction method. Results show that NPI provides the overall best performance. However, several correction approaches, for example the simple deletion procedure, can provide good performance in some situations, depending on the HRV parameters under consideration. NEW & NOTEWORTHY This work analyzes the performance of some correction techniques commonly applied to the missing beats problem in RR time series. From artifact-free RR series, spurious values were inserted based on actual data of experimental settings. We intend our work to be a guide to show how artifacts should be corrected to preserve as much as possible the original heart rate variability properties.

N2  - Resistive loading affects the breathing pattern and causes an increase in negative  intrathoracic pressure. The aim of this paper was to study the influence inspiratory and expiratory loading on cardio-respiratory interaction. We recorded electrocardiogram (ECG) and respiratory inductance plethysmogram (RIP) in 11 healthy male subjects under normal and resistive loading conditions. The R-R time series were extracted from the ECG and respiratory phases were calculated from the ribcage and abdominal RIP using the Hilbert transform. Both the series were transformed into ternary symbol vectors based on the changes between two successive R-R intervals or respiratory phases, respectively. Subsequently, words of length `3 digits' were formed and the correspondence between words of the two series was determined to quantify cardio-respiratory interaction. Adding inspiratory and expiratory resistive loads resulted in an increase in inspiratory and expiatory time, respectively. Furthermore, we observed a significant increase in cardio-respiratory interaction during inspiratory resistive loading as compared to expiratory resistive loading (ribcage: 22.1±7.2 vs. 12.5±4.3 %, p<;0.0001; abdomen: 18.8±8.5 vs. 12.1±3.1 %, p<;0.05, respectively). Further studies may aid in better understanding the underlying physiological mechanisms and management of patients with breathing disorders.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Junctional ectopic tachycardia (JET) after congenital heart disease  (CHD) surgery is often self-limiting but is associated with increased risk of morbidity and mortality. Contributing factors and impact of time to achieve rate control of JET are poorly described. METHODS: From January 2010 to June 2015, a retrospective, single-center cohort study was performed of children who developed JET after CHD surgery . We classified the cohort into two groups: patients who achieved rate control of JET in ≤24 hours and in >24 hours. We examined factors associated with time to rate control and compared clinical outcomes (mortality, duration of mechanical ventilation, length of intensive care unit [ICU], and hospital stay) between the two groups. RESULTS: Our cohort included 27 children, with a median age of 3 (interquartile range: 0.7-38] months. The most common CHD lesions were ventricular septal defect (n = 10, 37%), tetralogy of Fallot (n = 7, 25.9%), and transposition of the great arteries (n = 4, 14.8%). In all, 15 (55.6%) and 12 (44.4%) patients achieved rate control of JET in ≤24 hours and >24 hours, respectively. There was a difference in median mechanical ventilation time (97 [21-145) vs 311 [100-676] hours; P = .013) and ICU stay (5.0 [2.0-8.0] vs 15.5 [5.5-32.8] days, P = .023) between the patients who achieved faster rate control than those who didn't. There was no difference in length of hospital stay and mortality between the groups. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated that time to achieve rate control of JET was associated with increased duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU stay.

N2  - The number of studies about ultrashort cardiovascular time series is increasing  because of the demand for mobile applications in telemedicine and e-health monitoring. However, the current literature still needs a proper validation of heartbeat nonlinear dynamics assessment from ultrashort time series. This paper reports on the reliability of the Lagged Poincaré Plot (LPP) parameters-calculated from ultrashort cardiovascular time series. Reliability is studied on simulated as well as on real RR series. Simulated RR series are generated and LPP parameters estimated for ultrashort time series (from 15 to 60 s) are compared to those estimated from 1 h. All LPP parameters estimated from time series longer than 35 s presented a Spearman's correlation coefficient higher than 0.99. RR series acquired from 32 healthy subjects during 5-min resting state sessions are used to test the LPP approach in experimental data. The usefulness of ultrashort term parameters in real data is accomplished also studying their ability to discriminate positive and negative valence of auditory stimuli taken from the International Affective Digitized Sound System (IADS) dataset. The achieved accuracies in the recognition of elicitation along the valence dimension, using only the LPP parameters, were of 77.78% for 1 min 28 s series, and of 79.17% for 35 s series.

N2  - Time series analysis with nonlinear delay differential equations (DDEs) reveals  nonlinear as well as spectral properties of the underlying dynamical system. Here, global DDE models were used to analyze 5 min data segments of electrocardiographic (ECG) recordings in order to capture distinguishing features for different heart conditions such as normal heart beat, congestive heart failure, and atrial fibrillation. The number of terms and delays in the model as well as the order of nonlinearity of the model have to be selected that are the most discriminative. The DDE model form that best separates the three classes of data was chosen by exhaustive search up to third order polynomials. Such an approach can provide deep insight into the nature of the data since linear terms of a DDE correspond to the main time-scales in the signal and the nonlinear terms in the DDE are related to nonlinear couplings between the harmonic signal parts. The DDEs were able to detect atrial fibrillation with an accuracy of 72%, congestive heart failure with an accuracy of 88%, and normal heart beat with an accuracy of 97% from 5 min of ECG, a much shorter time interval than required to achieve comparable performance with other methods.

N2  - The heart rate variability signal derived from the ECG is a beat-to-beat record of  RR-intervals and is, as a time series, irregularly sampled. It is common engineering practice to resample this record, typically at 4 Hz, onto a regular time axis for conventional analysis using IIR and FIR filters, and power spectral estimators, in the time and frequency domain, respectively. However, such interpolative resampling introduces noise into the signal and the information quality is compromised. Here, the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck third-order band-pass filter is presented which operates on data sampled at arbitrary time and preserves fidelity. The algorithm is available as open source code for MATLAB(®) (MathWorks™ Inc.) and supported by an interactive website at http://clinengnhs.liv.ac.uk/OUGP.htm.

N2  - Respiratory signals monitored in the neonatal intensive care units are usually  ignored due to the high prevalence of noise and false alarms (FA). Apneic events are generally therefore indicated by a pulse oximeter alarm reacting to the subsequent desaturation. However, the high FA rate in the photoplethysmogram may desensitize staff, reducing the reaction speed. The main reason for the high FA rates of critical care monitors is the unimodal analysis behaviour. In this work, we propose a multimodal analysis framework to reduce the FA rate in neonatal apnoea monitoring. Information about oxygen saturation, heart rate, respiratory rate and signal quality was extracted from electrocardiogram, impedance pneumogram and photoplethysmographic signals for a total of 20 features in the 5 min interval before a desaturation event. 1616 desaturation events from 27 neonatal admissions were annotated by two independent reviewers as true (physiologically relevant) or false (noise-related). Patients were divided into two independent groups for training and validation, and a support vector machine was trained to classify the events as true or false. The best classification performance was achieved on a combination of 13 features with sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of 100% in the training set, and a sensitivity of 86%, a specificity of 91% and an accuracy of 90% in the validation set.

N2  - In this paper, we present a patient-adaptable algorithm for ECG heartbeat  classification, based on a previously developed automatic classifier and a clustering algorithm. Both classifier and clustering algorithms include features from the RR interval series and morphology descriptors calculated from the wavelet transform. Integrating the decisions of both classifiers, the presented algorithm can work either automatically or with several degrees of assistance. The algorithm was comprehensively evaluated in several ECG databases for comparison purposes. Even in the fully automatic mode, the algorithm slightly improved the performance figures of the original automatic classifier; just with less than two manually annotated heartbeats (MAHB) per recording, the algorithm obtained a mean improvement for all databases of 6.9% in accuracy A, of 6.5% in global sensitivity S and of 8.9% in global positive predictive value P(+). An assistance of just 12 MAHB per recording resulted in a mean improvement of 13.1% in A, of 13.9% in S, and of 36.1% in P(+). For the assisted mode, the algorithm outperformed other state-of-the-art classifiers with less expert annotation effort. The results presented in this paper represent an improvement in the field of automatic and patient-adaptable heartbeats classification, concluding that the performance of an automatic classifier can be improved with an efficient handling of the expert assistance.

N2  - As the symptoms and signs of heart diseases that cause sudden cardiac death, cardiac  arrhythmia has attracted great attention. Due to limitations in time and space, traditional approaches to cardiac arrhythmias detection fail to provide a real-time continuous monitoring and testing service applicable in different environmental conditions. Integrated with the latest technologies in ECG (electrocardiograph) analysis and medical care, the pervasive computing technology makes possible the ubiquitous cardiac care services, and thus brings about new technical challenges, especially in the formation of cardiac care architecture and realization of the real-time automatic ECG detection algorithm dedicated to care devices. In this paper, a ubiquitous cardiac care prototype system is presented with its architecture framework well elaborated. This prototype system has been tested and evaluated in all the clinical-/home-/outdoor-care modes with a satisfactory performance in providing real-time continuous cardiac arrhythmias monitoring service unlimitedly adaptable in time and space.

N2  - The first 10 min of electrically provoked ventricular fibrillation in dogs with  ischemic heart disease were characterized by organized myocardial activity evidenced by the dominant ECG frequency structure. During the first 2 min of ventricular fibrillation, low-frequency oscillations (4-7 Hz) dominated, while on min 3 to 10 after the onset of fibrillation, the dominant frequencies were low and medium (4-12 Hz). After 10-min fibrillation, the oscillations became non-dominant. Thus, ischemic myocardium maintains the organized structure of ventricular fibrillation for the first 10 min, which is important for the development of automatic diagnostics of abnormal cardiac activity in humans.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Despite the strong evidence of the clinical utility of QTc  prolongation as a surrogate marker of cardiac risk, QTc measurement is not part of clinical routine either in hospital or in physician offices. We evaluated a novel device ("the QT scale") to measure heart rate (HR) and QTc interval. METHOD: The QT scale is a weight scale embedding an ECG acquisition system with four limb sensors (feet and hands: lead I, II, and III). We evaluated the reliability of QT scale in healthy subjects (cohort 1) and cardiac patients (cohorts 2 and 3) considering a learning (cohort 2) and two validation cohorts. The QT scale and the standard 12-lead recorder were compared using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) in cohorts 2 and 3. Absolute value of heart rate and QTc intervals between manual and automatic measurements using ECGs from the QT scale and a clinical device were compared in cohort 1. RESULTS: We enrolled 16 subjects in cohort 1 (8 w, 8 m; 32 ± 8 vs 34 ± 10 years, P = 0.7), 51 patients in cohort 2 (13 w, 38 m; 61 ± 16 vs 58 ± 18 years, P = 0.6), and 13 AF patients in cohort 3 (4 w, 9 m; 63 ± 10 vs 64 ± 10 years, P = 0.9). Similar automatic heart rate and QTc were delivered by the scale and the clinical device in cohort 1: paired difference in RR and QTc were -7 ± 34 milliseconds (P = 0.37) and 3.4 ± 28.6 milliseconds (P = 0.64), respectively. The measurement of stability was slightly lower in ECG from the QT scale than from the clinical device (ICC: 91% vs 80%) in cohort 3. CONCLUSION: The "QT scale device" delivers valid heart rate and QTc interval measurements.

N2  - OBJECTIVE To date, treatment of complex unruptured intracranial aneurysms (UIAs)  remains challenging. Therefore, advanced techniques are required to achieve an optimal result in treating these patients safely. In this study, the safety and efficacy of rapid ventricular pacing (RVP) to facilitate microsurgical clip reconstruction was investigated prospectively in a joined neurosurgery, anesthesiology, and cardiology study. METHODS Patients with complex UIAs were prospectively enrolled. Both the safety and efficacy of RVP were evaluated by recording cardiovascular events and outcomes of patients as well as the amount of aneurysm occlusion after the surgical clip reconstruction procedure. A questionnaire was used to evaluate aneurysm preparation and clip application under RVP. RESULTS Twenty patients (mean age 51.6 years, range 28-66 years) were included in this study. Electrode positioning was easy in 19 (95%) of 20 patients, and removal of electrodes was easily accomplished in all patients (100%). No complications associated with the placement of the pacing electrodes occurred, such as cardiac perforation or cardiac tamponade. RVP was applied in 16 patients. The mean aneurysm size was 11.1 ± 5.5 mm (range 6-30 mm). RVP proved to be a very helpful tool in aneurysm preparation and clip application in 15 (94%) of 16 patients. RVP was used for a mean duration of 60 ± 25 seconds, a mean heart rate of 173 ± 23 bpm (range 150-210 bpm), and a reduction of mean arterial pressure to 35-55 mm Hg. RVP leads to softening of the aneurysm sac facilitating its mobilization, clip application, and closure of the clip blades. In 2 patients, cardiac events were documented that resolved without permanent sequelae in both. In every patient with successful RVP (n = 14) a total or near-total aneurysm occlusion was documented. In the 1 patient in whom the second RVP failed due to pacemaker electrode dislocation, additional temporary clipping was required to secure the aneurysm, but was not as sufficient as RVP. This led to an incomplete clipping of the aneurysm and finally a remnant on postoperative digital subtraction angiography. A pacemaker lead dislocation occurred in 3 (19%) of 16 patients, but intraoperative repositioning requires less than 20 seconds. Outcome was favorable in all patients according to the modified Rankin Scale. CONCLUSIONS To the best of the authors' knowledge this is the first prospective interdisciplinary study of RVP use in patients with UIAs. RVP is an elegant technique that facilitates clip reconstruction in complex UIAs. The safety of the procedure is good. However, because this procedure requires extensive preoperative cardiological workup of the patient and an experienced neurosurgery and neuroanesthesiology team with much cerebrovascular expertise, actually it remains reserved for selected elective cases and highly specialized centers.

N2  - The gold standard method to monitor heart rate variability (HRV) comprises measuring  the time series of interbeat interval durations from electrocardiographic (ECG) recordings. However, due to the widespread use, simplicity and usability of photoplethysmographic (PPG) techniques, monitoring pulse rate variability (PRV) from pulse wave recordings has become a viable alternative to standard HRV analysis. The present study investigates the accuracy of PRV, measured as a surrogate of HRV, for the quantification of descriptive indexes computed in the time domain (mean, variance), frequency domain (low-to-high frequency power ratio LF/HF, HF band central frequency) and information domain (entropy, conditional entropy). We analyze short time series (300 intervals) of HRV measured from the ECG and of PRV acquired from Finometer device in 76 subjects monitored in the resting supine position (SU) and in the upright position during head-up tilt (HUT). Time, frequency and information domain indexes are computed for each HRV and PRV series and, for each index, the comparison between the two approaches is performed through statistical comparison of the distributions across subjects, robust linear regression, and Bland-Altman plots. Results of the comparison indicate an overall good agreement between PRV-based and HRV-based indexes, with an accuracy that is slightly lower during HUT than during SU, and for the band-power ratio and conditional entropy. These results suggest the feasibility of PRV-based assessment of HRV descriptive indexes, and suggest to further investigate the agreement in conditions of physiological stress.

N2  - The management of intensive care patients with implanted devices requires the  knowledge of the type of device (e.g. pacemaker, defibrillator, device for cardiac contractility modulation or event recorder). An electrocardiogram (ECG) and chest-X-ray can be helpful for identification of the type and manufacturer of the device. Information concerning the programmed parameters can be obtained by device interrogation. The establishment of invasive monitoring can be complicated by the intracardiac electrodes of the devices and requires a careful selection of the venous access site. In cases of external cardioversion/defibrillation there are some specific considerations to be made to avoid damage of the implanted device. Finally, adaption of device programming to the special circumstances in the intensive care unit may help patient and physician.

N2  - A 40-year-old male struck his chest against a pole during a basketball game and had  sudden out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. After bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation, fire and emergency medical services personnel provided six defibrillation attempts prior to emergency department arrival. A 7th attempt in the emergency department using a different vector was unsuccessful. On the 8th attempt, using a second defibrillator with defibrillator pads placed adjacent to the primary set of defibrillator pads, two shocks were administered in near simultaneous fashion. The double sequential defibrillation was successful and the patient had return of spontaneous circulation at the next pulse check. He recovered in the intensive care unit, was discharged home 1 month later, and continues to follow up in clinic over 1 year later with a Cerebral Performance Category score of 1 (short-term memory deficits).

N2  - OBJECTIVES: This study sought to investigate the differences in detecting (e.g.,  triggering) periprocedural myocardial infarction (PMI) among 3 current definitions. BACKGROUND: PMI is a frequent component of primary endpoints in coronary device trials. Identification of all potential suspected events is critical for accurate event ascertainment. Automatic triggers based on study databases prevent underreporting of events. METHODS: We generated automated algorithms to trigger PMI based on each definition and compared results using data from the RESOLUTE all comers trial. RESULTS: The operationalization of current PMI definitions was achieved by defining programmable algorithms used to interrogate the study database. From a total of 636 PMI triggers, we identified 234 for the World Health Organization extended definition, 382 for the Third Universal definition, and 216 for the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions definition. Differences among the biomarkers used, different cutoff values, and in the hierarchy among biomarkers within definitions, yielded a different number of triggers, and identified unique triggers for each definition. Only 38 triggers were consistently identified by all definitions. Availability of ECG data, eCRF data on clinical presentation, and the reporting of >2 post-procedural values of the same biomarker influenced considerably the number of PMI triggers identified. CONCLUSIONS: PMI definitions are not interchangeable. The number of triggers identified and consequently the potential number of events varies significantly, highlighting the importance of rigorous methodology when PMI is a component of a powered endpoint. Emphasis on collection of biomarkers, ECG data, and clinical status at baseline may improve the correct identification of PMI triggers.

N2  - This paper is concerned with the automatic control of drug administration in  patients suffering from Brugada Syndrome (BS). Drugs such as flecainide, procainamide, ajmaline and pilsicainide should be administrated under carefully controlled electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring given that the treatment must be stopped if some ECG disturbing conditions appear. These conditions are, among others the development of premature ventricular contraction (PVC), atrial fibrillation (AF) and the widening of the QRS wave. The proposed system can detect these abnormalities by using a pattern recognition approach based on Hidden Markov Models (HMM) with features extracted from three scales of the Wavelet Transform (WT). Performances higher than 98% were reached regarding the classification of normal and abnormal pulses. The system was trained and tested mainly in data from the standard MIT-BIH arrhythmia database.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The high prevalence of sleep disordered breathing (SDB) among heart  diseases patients becomes increasingly recognized. A reliable exploring tool of SDB well adapted to cardiologists practice would be very useful for the management of these patients. METHODS: We assessed a novel multi-modal electrocardiogram (ECG) Holter which incorporated both thoracic impedance and pulse oximetry signals. We compared in a home setting, a standard condition for Holter recordings, results from the novel device to a classical ambulatory polygraph in subjects with suspected SDB. The analysis of cardiac arrhythmias in relationship with SDB is also presented. A total of 118 patients clinically suspected of having SDB were evaluated (mean age 57 ± 14 years, mean body mass index [BMI] 32 ± 6 kg/m(2)). The new device allows calculating a new index called thoracic impedance (TI) disturbance index (TIDI+) evaluated from TI and SpO(2) signals recorded from a Holter monitor. RESULTS: In the population under study, 93% had more than 70% of usable TI signal and 95% had more than 90% for SpO(2) during sleep time recording. Screening performance results based on automatic analysis is accurate: TIDI + demonstrates a high level of sensitivity (96.8%), specificity (72.3%) as well as positive (82.4%) and negative (94.4%) predictive value for the detection of SDB. Moreover, detection of SDB periods permits us to observe a possible respiratory association of several nocturnal arrhythmias. CONCLUSIONS: The multi-modal Holter should be considered as a valuable evaluating tool for SDB screening and as a case selection technique for facilitating access to a full polysomnography for severe cases. Moreover, it offers a unique opportunity to study arrhythmia consequences with both respiratory and hypoxia disturbances.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To adapt to a new environment or situation, biological systems explore  the most convenient state while moving between attractors by the force of random fluctuation. From this concept, the random component in physiological signals is assumed to increase during developmental and degenerative stages of life. To examine this hypothesis, we measured the age-dependent changes in the random component of heart rate variability (HRV) in 24-h electrocardiography (ECG) big data and in patients with a developmental disorder (DD). APPROACH: We measured separately regulated and random components of HRV with autoregressive (AR) model fitting, by which the ratio of random component as the fractional variance of AR residual time series. From the ALLSTAR database of about 304 000 ambulatory 24-h ECGs, we randomly extracted the data of 1930 men and 1987 women uniformly for all ages from 0 to 100 years old (100 cases per 5-year strata for each sex). Data were also obtained from male pediatric patients with DD (age 10-15 years). MAIN RESULTS: While the variance of the regulated component of HRV increased from age 0 to 20, decreased with age until 40, and reached a plateau in both sexes, the ratio of the random component was high at birth, decreased with age until 35 in men and 30 in women, and increased again after 75 in men and 85 in women (P  <  0.0001 for all). In patients with a DD, the ratio of the random component was significantly lower than that in age-and-sex matched subjects in the database. SIGNIFICANCE: We found that the ratio of the random component of HRV is increased during developmental and degenerative stages of life and that it may be reduced in DD patients during their development.

N2  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) is an important indicator of  the functionality of the arterial baroreceptors, and its assessment may have major research and clinical implications. An important requirement for its quantification is the continuous recording of electrocardiography (ECG) signal, so as to extract the RR interval, in parallel with continuous beat-to-beat blood pressure recording. We aimed to accurately calculate the RR Interval from pressure wave recordings per se, namely, the Pulse Interval (PI) using various arterial pulse wave analysis algorithms and to evaluate the precision and accuracy of BRS values calculated with the PI compared to BRS values calculated with the RR Interval. METHODS: We analyzed the open access data of the Eurobavar study, which contains a set of ECG and arterial blood pressure (BP) wave signals recorded at 11 European centers. Pressure waveforms were continuously recorded by the Finapres apparatus which uses a finger cuff. The cuff pressure around the finger is dynamically adjusted by a servo-system to equal intra-arterial pressure, thus allowing the continuous recording of beat-to-beat BP waves. RR Interval was calculated from the ECG, whereas, PI was extracted from the arterial pulse waveforms, using 4 different methods (minimum, maximum, maximum 1st derivative and intersecting tangents method). BRS values were estimated by time domain and frequency domain methods. In order to compare agreement, accuracy, precision, variability, and the association between the reference BRS using the RR Interval and the BRS values using PI, standard statistical methods (i.e. intraclass correlation coefficients, RMSE, regression analysis) and Bland-Altman methods were performed. RESULTS: We found that analysis of pressure waves alone by frequency-based (i.e. spectral) methods, provides the most accurate results of BRS estimation compared to time-domain methods (ICC > 0.9, R > 0.9, RMSE > 0.8 ms/mmHg). Concerning the spectral method, any algorithm for PI calculation is sufficient, as all show excellent agreement with the respective RR-intervals determined by ECG time series. Only the intersecting tangents and the maximum 1st derivative methods for PI calculation produce the most accurate results in time domain BRS estimation. CONCLUSION: BRS estimation by proper analysis of pressure wave signals alone is feasible and accurate. Further studies are needed to investigate the clinical validity and relevance of the different BRS estimations in diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic levels.

N2  - The heart sound signal is a reflection of heart and vascular system motion.  Long-term continuous electrocardiogram (ECG) contains important information which can be helpful to prevent heart failure. A single piece of a long-term ECG recording usually consists of more than one hundred thousand data points in length, making it difficult to derive hidden features that may be reflected through dynamic ECG monitoring, which is also very time-consuming to analyze. In this paper, a Dynamic Time Warping based on MapReduce (MRDTW) is proposed to make prognoses of possible lesions in patients. Through comparison of a real-time ECG of a patient with the reference sets of normal and problematic cardiac waveforms, the experimental results reveal that our approach not only retains high accuracy, but also greatly improves the efficiency of the similarity measure in dynamic ECG series.

N2  - Obstructive sleep apnea represents the most common form of sleep-disordered  breathing and has a high prevalence in patients with cardiovascular disease. Disturbed sleep is a potential risk factor for cardiovascular disorders such as arterial hypertension, cardiac ischemia, sudden cardiac death, and stroke. In this study we investigated polysomnographic records and analyzed the ECG, plethysmogram, respiration and SpO2 time series during wakefulness (WK), NREM, and REM sleep stages applying variability and coupling analyses methods. We enrolled 55 patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) and 29 healthy control subjects (CON: 45.9±14.9 years, 21 male) in this study. OSAS patients were subdivided into a low- and high-risk group (LR: 50.8±14.1 years, n=29, 21 male; HR: 57.2±13.4 years, n=26, 19 male) based on the Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI) (CON: 0-5 AHI, LR: 5-15 AHI, HR: >15 AHI). We could demonstrate the presence of an altered autonomic function in OSAS patients, differing from healthy controls. This altered autonomic function was mainly based on heart rate-, respiratory-, SpO2- and plethysmogram variability and their couplings. The discriminant analysis showed that the optimal set consisting of two autonomic indices revealed a high classification power (ACC=86.7%, AUC=90.3%, SENS=89.5% and SPEC=84.6%) when comparing low-risk and high-risk OSAS patients during WK. These results were slightly improved when analyzing REM sleep stages. Based on these results it seems to be possible to perform optimal risk stratification for OSAS patients based on autonomic indices. Based on our findings it is possible to differentiate between high-risk OSAS patient and low-risk OSAS patient at an early stage and in a promising manner allowing to set up therapy strategies for those patients in an early stage.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Implantable Cardiac Monitors (ICMs) are used for long-term monitoring of  arrhythmias. BIOMONITOR III is a novel ICM with a miniaturized profile, long sensing vector due to a flexible antenna, simplified implantation with a dedicated insertion tool for pocket formation and ICM placement in a single step, and daily automatic Home Monitoring (HM) function. METHODS: In 47 patients undergoing BIOMONITOR III insertion for any ICM indication, 16 investigators at 10 Australian sites assessed handling characteristics of the insertion tool, R-wave amplitudes, noise burden, P-wave visibility, and HM transmission success. Patients were followed for 1 month. RESULTS: All 47 attempted insertions were successful. Median time from skin incision to removal of the insertion tool after ICM insertion was 39 s (IQR 19-65) and to wound closure and cleaning was 4.7 min (IQR 3.5-7.8). All aspects of the insertion tool were rated as "good" or "excellent" in ≥97.9% and "fair" in ≤2.1% of patients, except for "force needed for tunnelling" (91.5% good/excellent, 8.5% fair). Based on HM data, R-waves in the first month were stable at 0.70 ± 0.37 mV. Median noise burden (disabling automatic rhythm evaluation) was 0.19% (IQR 0.00-0.93), equivalent to 2.7 min (IQR 0.0-13.4) per day. In HM-transmitted ECG strips with regular sinus rhythm, P-waves were visible in 89 ± 24% of heart cycles. Patient-individual automatic Home Monitoring transmission success was 98.0% ± 5.5%. CONCLUSIONS: The novel ICM performed well in all aspects studied, including fast insertion, reliable R-wave sensing, good P-wave visibility, and highly successful HM transmissions.

N2  - Fetal motility is a widely accepted indicator of the well-being of a fetus. In  previous research, it has be shown that fetal motion (FM) is coherent with fetal heart rate accelerations and an indicator for active/rest cycles of the fetus. The most common approach for FM and fetal heart rate (FHR) assessment is by Doppler ultrasound (DUS). While DUS is the most common approach for studying the mechanical activities of the heart, noninvasive fetal electrocardiogram (ECG) and magnetocardiogram (MCG) recording and processing techniques have been considered as a possible competitor (or complement) for the DUS. In this study, a fully automatic and robust framework is proposed for the extraction, ranking and alignment of fetal QRS-complexes from noninvasive fetal ECG/MCG. Using notions from subspace tracking, two measures, namely the actogram and rotatogram, are defined for fetal motion tracking. The method is applied to four fetal ECG/MCG databases, including twin MCG recordings. By defining a novel measure of causality, it is shown that there is significant coherency and causal relationship between the actogram/rotatogram and FHR accelerations/decelerations. Using this measure, it is shown that in many cases, the actogram and rotatogram precede the FHR variations, which supports the idea of motion-induced FHR accelerations/decelerations for these cases and raises attention for the non-motion-induced FHR variations, which can be associated to the fetal central nervous system developments. The results of this study can lead to novel perspectives of the fetal sympathetic and parasympathetic brain systems and future requirements of fetal cardiac monitoring.

N2  - Electrocardiography (ECG) signal analysis is an effective method for diagnosis of  heart disease. However, the quality of ECG, corrupted by artifacts, limits the automatic ECG classification. In order to extract good quality ECG, we proposed a new ECG enhancement method based on tunable Q-factor wavelet transform (TQWT). In the proposed method, the original ECG signal was decomposed into high Q-factor component and low Q-factor component with dual-Q TQWT. According to the morphological of P, QRS, T waves in ECG, low Q-factor component was chosen for the representation of ECG. The proposed method was tested on 52 healthy volunteers and 52 myocardial infarction patients from the openly dataset of PTB diagnostic ECG. A total of 288 features, covering time, frequency, nonlinear, and entropy domains, were extracted from R-R interval and ECG (in a window of 5s) across 12 leads. The features were selected by Relief method, and 22 discriminative features were fed into five different classifiers. The classification accuracy for dual-Q TQWT was 86.3%, which was 4.7% higher than the filtered data based on k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm. The comparison results verified that the proposed dual-Q TQWT method provides good feasibility for ECG de-noising.

N2  - Electrocardiogram (ECG) is gaining increased attention as a biometric method in a  wide range of applications, such as access control and security/privacy requirements. The majority of reported investigations using the ECG biometric method are usually based on fiducial or nonfiducial methods, which are always accompanied by a series of issues, such as locating fiducial points accurately is difficult, feature selection is subjective, and classifiers are limited by the quantity and structure of data. This paper proposes a new biometric authentication system for human identification that uses ECG signals as a biometric trait and integrates a generalized S-transformation and a convolutional neural network (CNN). Specifically, we first introduce a blind segmentation strategy that effectively avoids difficult data-specific heartbeat recognition and segmentation techniques. Then, a generalized S-transformation is performed on the blind signal-processed ECG signal, capturing the ECG trajectory at each time point in the frequency domain. Next, the getframe technology is used to capture an image of the ECG trajectories and convert the one-dimensional signal to a two-dimensional image, which serves as the input layer of the CNN, thus fully reflecting the changing trend in the ECG signal spectrum characteristics over a continuous period. Finally, the CNN is used for automatic discriminative feature learning and representations, which avoids a tedious feature extraction algorithm. In addition, considering the possible impact of ECG signals with different signal behaviors on identification, experiments are performed on three ECG databases with diverse features, comprising normal individuals, atrial fibrillation patients, and a noisy database, to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Promising identification rates of 99%, 98%, and 99% were achieved, respectively. Thus, our proposed ECG authentication system can be effectively used for identity recognition under various conditions.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Acquired long QT syndrome is a reversible condition that can lead to  torsades de pointes and sudden cardiac death. OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequency, onset, frequency of medications, and risk factors for the syndrome in intensive care patients. METHODS: In a retrospective chart review of 88 subjects, hourly corrected QT intervals calculated by using the Bazett formula were collected. Acquired long QT syndrome was defined as a corrected QT of 500 milliseconds or longer or an increase in corrected QT of 60 milliseconds or greater from baseline level. Risk factors and medications administered were collected from patients' medical records. RESULTS: The syndrome occurred in 46 patients (52%); mean time of onset was 7.4 hours (SD, 9.4) from time of admission. Among the 88 patients, 52 (59%) received a known QTc-prolonging medication. Among the 46 with the syndrome, 23 (50%) received a known QT-prolonging medication. No other risk factor studied was significantly predictive of the syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: Acquired long QT syndrome occurs in patients not treated with a known QT-prolonging medication, indicating the importance of frequent QT monitoring of all intensive care patients.

N2  - There is a growing body of research focusing on automatic detection of ischemia and  myocardial infarction (MI) using computer algorithms. In clinical settings, ischemia and MI are diagnosed using electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings as well as medical context including patient symptoms, medical history, and risk factors-information that is often stored in the electronic health records. The ECG signal is inspected to identify changes in the morphology such as ST-segment deviation and T-wave changes. Some of the proposed methods compute similar features automatically while others use nonconventional features such as wavelet coefficients. This review provides an overview of the methods that have been proposed in this area, focusing on their historical evolution, the publicly available datasets that they have used to evaluate their performance, and the details of their algorithms for ECG and EHR analysis. The validation strategies that have been used to evaluate the performance of the proposed methods are also presented. Finally, the paper provides recommendations for future research to address the shortcomings of the currently existing methods and practical considerations to make the proposed technical solutions applicable in clinical practice.

N2  - Heart rate variability (HRV) is a promising marker for evaluating the remaining  autonomic function in people with spinal cord injury (SCI). HRV is commonly assessed by spectral analysis and detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA). This study aimed to investigate whether local scale exponent α(t) can reveal new features of HRV that cannot be reflected by spectral measures and DFA coefficients. We studied 12 participants with SCI and 15 healthy able-bodied controls. ECG signals were continually recorded during 10 min sitting and 10 min prone postures. α(t) was calculated for scales between 4 and 60 s. Because α(t) could be overestimated at small scales, we developed an approach for correcting α(t) based on previous studies. The simulation results on simulated monofractal time series with α between 0.5 and 1.3 showed that the proposed method can yield improved estimation of α(t). We applied the proposed method to raw RR interval series. The results showed that α(t) in healthy controls monotonically decreased with scale at scales between 4 and 12 s (0.083-0.25 Hz) in both the sitting and prone postures, whereas in participants with SCI, α(t) slowly decreased at almost all scales. The sharp decreasing trend in α(t) in controls suggests a more complex dynamics of HRV in controls. α(t) at scales between 4 (0.25 Hz) and around 7 s (0.143 Hz) was lower in subjects with SCI than in controls in the sitting posture; α(t) at a narrow range of scales around 12 s (0.083 Hz) was higher in participants with SCI than in controls in the prone posture. However, none of normalized low frequency (0.04-0.15 Hz) power, the ratio of low frequency power to high frequency (0.15-0.4 Hz) power and long-term (>11 beats) DFA coefficient showed significant difference between healthy controls and subjects with SCI in the prone posture. Our results suggest that α(t) can reveal more detailed information in comparison to spectral measures and the standard DFA parameters.

N2  - Although Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) statistic is a widely used method, some weaknesses  exist in investigating abrupt Change Point (CP) problems, e.g. it is time-consuming and invalid sometimes. To detect abrupt change from time series fast, a novel method is proposed based on Haar Wavelet (HW) and KS statistic (HWKS). First, the two Binary Search Trees (BSTs), termed TcA and TcD, are constructed by multi-level HW from a diagnosed time series; the framework of HWKS method is implemented by introducing a modified KS statistic and two search rules based on the two BSTs; and then fast CP detection is implemented by two HWKS-based algorithms. Second, the performance of HWKS is evaluated by simulated time series dataset. The simulations show that HWKS is faster, more sensitive and efficient than KS, HW, and T methods. Last, HWKS is applied to analyze the electrocardiogram (ECG) time series, the experiment results show that the proposed method can find abrupt change from ECG segment with maximal data fluctuation more quickly and efficiently, and it is very helpful to inspect and diagnose the different state of health from a patient's ECG signal.

N2  - Physiological signals are widely used to perform medical assessment for monitoring  an extensive range of pathologies, usually related to cardio-vascular diseases. Among these, both PhotoPlethysmoGraphy (PPG) and Electrocardiography (ECG) signals are those more employed. PPG signals are an emerging non-invasive measurement technique used to study blood volume pulsations through the detection and analysis of the back-scattered optical radiation coming from the skin. ECG is the process of recording the electrical activity of the heart over a period of time using electrodes placed on the skin. In the present paper we propose a physiological ECG/PPG "combo" pipeline using an innovative bio-inspired nonlinear system based on a reaction-diffusion mathematical model, implemented by means of the Cellular Neural Network (CNN) methodology, to filter PPG signal by assigning a recognition score to the waveforms in the time series. The resulting "clean" PPG signal exempts from distortion and artifacts is used to validate for diagnostic purpose an EGC signal simultaneously detected for a same patient. The multisite combo PPG-ECG system proposed in this work overpasses the limitations of the state of the art in this field providing a reliable system for assessing the above-mentioned physiological parameters and their monitoring over time for robust medical assessment. The proposed system has been validated and the results confirmed the robustness of the proposed approach.

N2  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The detection of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (pAF) in  patients presenting with ischaemic stroke shifts secondary stroke prevention to oral anticoagulation. In order to deal with the time- and resource-consuming manual analysis of prolonged electrocardiogram (ECG)-monitoring data, we investigated the effectiveness of pAF detection with an automated algorithm (AA) in comparison to a manual analysis with software support within the IDEAS study [study analysis (SA)]. METHODS: We used the dataset of the prospective IDEAS cohort of patients with acute ischaemic stroke/transient ischaemic attack presenting in sinus rhythm undergoing prolonged 72-h Holter ECG with central adjudication of atrial fibrillation (AF). This adjudicated diagnosis of AF was compared with a commercially available AA. Discordant results with respect to the diagnosis of pAF were resolved by an additional cardiological reference confirmation. RESULTS: Paroxysmal AF was finally diagnosed in 62 patients (5.9%) in the cohort (n = 1043). AA more often diagnosed pAF (n = 60, 5.8%) as compared with SA (n = 47, 4.5%). Due to a high sensitivity (96.8%) and negative predictive value (99.8%), AA was able to identify patients without pAF, whereas abnormal findings in AA required manual review (specificity 96%; positive predictive value 60.6%). SA exhibited a lower sensitivity (75.8%) and negative predictive value (98.5%), and showed a specificity and positive predictive value of 100%. Agreement between the two methods classified by kappa coefficient was moderate (0.591). CONCLUSION: Automated determination of 'absence of pAF' could be used to reduce the manual review workload associated with review of prolonged Holter ECG recordings.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: We investigated whether additional electrocardiographic (ECG) metrics  not available on current patient monitors could predict bradyasystolic cardiac arrest in hospitalized adult patients. METHODS: A retrospective case-control design was used to study eight ECG metrics from 22 adult bradyasystolic patients and their 45 control patients. The eight ECG metrics included heart rate, QRS width, interval from P-wave peak to QRS onset (PRp), heart rate-corrected interval from QRS onset to T-wave peak (QTpc), amplitude of QRS peak (rAmp), amplitude of P-wave (pAmp), amplitude of T-wave (tAmp), and absolute difference in the ECG amplitudes at QRS onset and offset divided by rAmp, that is, relative J-point amplitude (relJAmp). We derived the maximal true-positive rate (TPR) of detecting cardiac arrest at a globally minimal false-positive rate (FPR) for each metric and for the absolute slope values resulted from a linear fitting of the time series of these metrics. We also recorded the first time crossing the detection threshold to the time of arrest as lead time. RESULTS: Conditions of relJAmp >20% and PRp >196.6 ms, respectively, achieved a TPR of 22.7% and 27.3% with zero FPRs. The lead prediction time of these two conditions was 5.7 ± 6.8 hours and 8.0 ± 7.2 hours, respectively. Performance of triggers based on the absolute slope values depended on the window length used for linear fitting. rAmp slope of a 2-hour window, PRp slope of a 30-minute window, and relJAmp slope of a 2-hour window achieved the best TPR of 27.3% (FPR = 2.3%, lead time = 6.5 ± 5.7 hours), 14.3% (FPR=0.0%, lead time = 10.9 ± 10.9), and 18.2% (FPR = 2.3%, lead time = 8.8 ± 9.8), respectively. McNemar test showed that only relJAmp >20.0% is significantly different from the baseline trigger of HR >149.3 bpm (p=0.046). In addition, metrics-based and slope-based triggers were complementary as an "OR" combination of two single-metric triggers raised the TPR up to 45.4% with zero FPR. CONCLUSIONS: It is feasible to compute additional metrics from continuous ECG from bedside monitors. These additional parameters can provide highly specific triggers for predicting bradyasystolic cardiac arrest. Complementary triggers based on the slope of trending of these ECG metrics can further increase the sensitivity without incurring false positives.

N2  - Vector autoregressive models (VAR models) are often used to model and to analyze  multivariate time series, especially to provide short-term forecasts. A common method of estimating coefficients of these VAR models is solving the Yule- Walker equations. This work introduces and investigates a method to set up "sparse" VAR models, in order to obtain a comparable prognosis quality with significantly fewer coefficients. For this purpose, an artificial neural network was programmed in Python with TensorFlow. Sparsity arises from the implementation of regularization algorithms.Based on simulated data and an ECG, we show that a comparable prognosis quality can be achieved with significantly fewer coefficients. In addition, sparse VAR models can also be determined if the data would actually lead to an underdetermined system of equations. Thus, sparse VAR models may help to classify short epochs of biosignals, e.g. P-waves or QRS-complexes.

N2  - This study aimed at developing a method for automated electrocardiography (ECG)  artifact detection and removal from trunk electromyography signals. Independent Component Analysis (ICA) method was applied to the simulated data set of ECG-corrupted surface electromyography (SEMG) signals. Independent Components (ICs) correspond to ECG artifact were then identified by an automated detection algorithm and subsequently removed. The detection performance of the algorithm was compared to that by visual inspection, while the artifact elimination performance was compared with Butterworth high pass filter at 30 Hz cutoff (BW HPF 30). The automated ECG-artifact detection algorithm successfully recognized the ECG source components in all data sets with a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 99%. Better performance indicated by a significantly higher correlation coefficient (p<0.001) with the original EMG recordings was found in the SEMG data cleaned by the ICA-based method, than that by BW HPF 30. The automated ECG-artifact removal method for trunk SEMG recordings proposed in this study was demonstrated to produce a very good detection rate and preserved essential EMG components while keeping its distortion to minimum. The automatic nature of our method has solved the problem of visual inspection by standard ICA methods and brings great clinical benefits.

N2  - Electrocardiogram (ECG) data from patients with a variety of heart conditions are  studied using ordinal pattern partition networks. The ordinal pattern partition networks are formed from the ECG time series by symbolizing the data into ordinal patterns. The ordinal patterns form the nodes of the network and edges are defined through the time ordering of the ordinal patterns in the symbolized time series. A network measure, called the mean degree, is computed from each time series-generated network. In addition, the entropy and number of non-occurring ordinal patterns (NFP) is computed for each series. The distribution of mean degrees, entropies, and NFPs for each heart condition studied is compared. A statistically significant difference between healthy patients and several groups of unhealthy patients with varying heart conditions is found for the distributions of the mean degrees, unlike for any of the distributions of the entropies or NFPs.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Detection of atrial fibrillation (AF) in patients who had ischaemic  stroke and transient ischaemic attack (IS/TIA) is recommended. We aimed to compare external loop recording (ELR) against simultaneous continuous ECG recording for AF detection in patients who had acute IS/TIA and determine sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value of AF detection using ELR. We hypothesised ELR to detect 15% fewer patients with AF than continuous ECG recording. METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, we included 1412 patients who had acute IS/TIA without prior AF. Monitoring was 48 hours. Primary outcome was AF >30 s. Cardiologist verified AF in continuous ECG was gold standard. RESULTS: In continuous ECG, 38 (2.7%) patients had AF. ELR automatically categorised 219/1412 patients (15.5%) with AF, including 32/38 (85%) patients with AF in continuous ECG. After cardiologist adjudication of ELR recordings, AF was diagnosed in 57/219 patients, of which 32 (56%) had AF in continuous ECG. For adjudicated AF detection by ELR, sensitivity was 84%, 95% CI (69% to 94%), specificity was 98%, 95% CI (97% to 99%) and positive predictive value was 56%, 95% CI (42% to 69%). CONCLUSION: Automatic AF detection with ELR results in an AF diagnosis in more than five patients without AF for each patient with AF as verified in continuous ECG. For adjudicated AF detection by ELR, sensitivity was confirmed to 84% and specificity 98%. Automatic ELR as investigated in this study may be considered to rule out AF, but it is not suitable as a single monitoring device for AF screening in patients early after stroke.

N2  - Automatic classification of abnormal beats in ECG signals is crucial for monitoring  cardiac conditions and the performance of the classification will improve the success rate of the treatment. However, under certain circumstances, traditional classifiers cannot be adapted well to the variation of ECG morphologies or variation of different patients due to fixed hand-crafted features selection. Additionally, existing deep learning related solutions reach their limitation because they fail to use the beat-to-beat information together with single-beat morphologies. This paper applies a novel solution which converts one-dimensional ECG signal into spectro-temporal images and use multiple dense convolutional neural network to capture both beat-to-beat and single-beat information for analysis. The results of simulation on the MIT-BIH arrhythmias database demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology by showing an outstanding detection performance compared to other existing methods.

N2  - Atrial fibrillation (Afib) contributes significantly to overall cardiovascular risk.  Widespread screening for Afib in primary care is sometimes performed by palpation, but suffers from low accuracy and is dependent on clinician experience. Algorithms implemented on oscillometric blood pressure devices can detect Afib with high sensitivity and specificity, but information on factors affecting accuracy is scant. Concurrent diagnostic electrocardiogram (ECG) and oscillometry were measured in participants in ECG clinics at two sites. Root mean squared successive difference (RMSSD) and irregularity index (Irrx) were calculated from oscillometric data and used to train logistic regression classifiers. Monte Carlo cross validation with 20 splits was performed to estimate confidence intervals for mean sensitivity and specificity, with various weightings, in the absence or presence of ectopics, and with or without repeated measurements. 707 measurements, including 168 Afib, were collected from 569 participants with mean (standard deviation) age of 63 (16) years. Sensitivity/specificity of RMSSD and Irrx were 0.982/0.908 and 0.986/0.960 respectively when ectopics were included. Excluding ectopics from the data improved specificity by up to 5%. Nevertheless, based on this performance and after accounting for prevalence of Afib in the population aged over 60 years, and estimated costs of healthcare, oscillometric screening for Afib in this age group could return a positive net health-economic benefit.

N2  - BACKGROUND: There are limited studies on the automatic detection of T waves in  arrhythmic electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. This is perhaps because there is no available arrhythmia dataset with annotated T waves. There is a growing need to develop numerically-efficient algorithms that can accommodate the new trend of battery-driven ECG devices. Moreover, there is also a need to analyze long-term recorded signals in a reliable and time-efficient manner, therefore improving the diagnostic ability of mobile devices and point-of-care technologies. METHODS: Here, the T wave annotation of the well-known MIT-BIH arrhythmia database is discussed and provided. Moreover, a simple fast method for detecting T waves is introduced. A typical T wave detection method has been reduced to a basic approach consisting of two moving averages and dynamic thresholds. The dynamic thresholds were calibrated using four clinically known types of sinus node response to atrial premature depolarization (compensation, reset, interpolation, and reentry). RESULTS: The determination of T wave peaks is performed and the proposed algorithm is evaluated on two well-known databases, the QT and MIT-BIH Arrhythmia databases. The detector obtained a sensitivity of 97.14% and a positive predictivity of 99.29% over the first lead of the validation databases (total of 221,186 beats). CONCLUSIONS: We present a simple yet very reliable T wave detection algorithm that can be potentially implemented on mobile battery-driven devices. In contrast to complex methods, it can be easily implemented in a digital filter design.

N2  - High rates of false monitoring alarms in intensive care can desensitize staff and  therefore pose a significant risk to patient safety. Like other critical arrhythmia alarms, asystole alarms require immediate attention by the care providers as a true asystole event can be acutely life threatening. Here, it is illustrated that most false asystole alarms can be attributed to poor signal quality, and we propose and evaluate an algorithm to identify data windows of poor signal quality and thereby help suppress false asystole alarms. The algorithm combines intuitive signal-quality features (degree of signal saturation and baseline wander) and information from other physiological signals that might be available. Algorithm training and testing was performed on the MIMIC II and 2015 PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge databases, respectively. The algorithm achieved an alarm specificity of 81.0% and sensitivity of 95.4%, missing only one out of 22 true asystole alarms. On a separate neonatal data set, the algorithm was able to reject 89.7% (890 out of 992) of false asystole alarms while keeping all 22 true events. The results show that the false asystole alarm rate can be significantly reduced through basic signal quality evaluation.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Junctional ectopic tachycardia (JET) is a common arrhythmia causing  hemodynamic impairment following corrective cardiac surgery such as tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) repair. METHODS: We report our experience with postoperative JET following surgical repair of TOF. The retrospective study was done from 2003 to 2012 with a total of 105 patients who underwent TOF repair. These patients' clinical and electrocardiographic data (pre-, intra-, and postoperative) were monitored to identify risk factors for the occurrence of JET and to evaluate the outcome of the affected patients. RESULTS: Incidence-Fourteen patients developed JET, with only four patients going directly from sinus rhythm to JET. In all others, either a transient atrioventricular (AV) block or a junctional rhythm preceded JET, mostly intraoperatively, showing a significant relation ( P = .010). Age-Patients with JET were of younger age ( P = .025) and had longer cardiopulmonary bypass ( P = .044) and aortic cross-clamping times ( P = .038). Increased cost and care-The occurrence of JET was associated with a longer stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) and a prolonged need for inotropic support and mechanical ventilation. Time to rate control correlated with length of ICU and hospital stay. MORTALITY: All JET patients converted into sinus rhythm, one of them died shortly after cessation of JET and two patients subsequently developed a first-degree AV block. CONCLUSION: The occurrence of JET remains an important complication during the initial postoperative period by increasing mechanical ventilation time, the need for inotropic support, and prolonging the length of ICU and hospital stay. Risk factors are younger age, longer aortic cross-clamping/bypass times, and intraoperative arrhythmias.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Ultrasound is an effective tool for rapid noninvasive assessment of  cardiac structure and function. Determining the cardiorespiratory phases of each frame in the ultrasound video and capturing the cardiac function at a much higher temporal resolution are essential in many applications. Fulfilling these requirements is particularly challenging in preclinical studies involving small animals with high cardiorespiratory rates, requiring cumbersome and expensive specialized hardware. METHODS: We present a novel method for the retrospective estimation of cardiorespiratory phases directly from the ultrasound videos. It transforms the videos into a univariate time series preserving the evidence of periodic cardiorespiratory motion, decouples the signatures of cardiorespiratory motion with a trend extraction technique, and estimates the cardiorespiratory phases using a Hilbert transform approach. We also present a robust nonparametric regression technique for respiratory gating and a novel kernel-regression model for reconstructing images at any cardiac phase facilitating temporal superresolution. RESULTS: We validated our methods using two-dimensional echocardiography videos and electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings of six mice. Our cardiac phase estimation method provides accurate phase estimates with a mean-phase-error range of 3%-6% against ECG derived phase and outperforms three previously published methods in locating ECGs R-wave peak frames with a mean-frame-error range of 0.73-1.36. Our kernel-regression model accurately reconstructs images at any cardiac phase with a mean-normalized-correlation range of 0.81-0.85 over 50 leave-one-out-cross-validation rounds. CONCLUSION AND SIGNIFICANCE: Our methods can enable tracking of cardiorespiratory phases without additional hardware and reconstruction of respiration-free single cardiac-cycle videos at a much higher temporal resolution.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Endotracheal suction (ETS) is a common invasive procedure which is  done to keep the airways patent by mechanically removing accumulated pulmonary secretions to all in patients with artificial airways. Many life-threatening complications can occur when the procedure is not performed correctly. Although the evidence-based recommendations regarding ETS are available, many of these have not been observed in nurse's clinical practice. We assessed the intensive care nurses' knowledge and practice of ETS to intubated patients in selected hospitals in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. METHODOLOGY: A descriptive cross-sectional study design involving 103 Intensive Care Unit (ICU) nurses in Dar es Salaam city was conducted in 2014. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 20 where descriptive statistics were employed to interpret data. RESULTS: Majority of ICU nurses (69.9%) knew the indication for the procedure, (77.7%) knew the action to be taken in case of abrupt change in the ECG monitor; however, 80.6% demonstrated undesirable overall knowledge on ETS evidence-based recommendations. Nurses with ICU training (57.3%) significantly demonstrated higher knowledge of ETS than non-trained nurses (P<0.005), while all other factors had no influence. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS: Majority of ICU nurses do not have desirable knowledge and skills of ETS, and are currently not following current ETS recommendations. This study has shown that training on ICU skills have positive influence to recommended ETS knowledge. We recommend ICU training, provision of clinical guidelines and adequate support to nurses employed in ICUs. Also, further studies using analytical approach to identify other factors beyond the scope of this study and testing the best approach in fostering adherence to ETS evidence-based recommendations are crucial.

N2  - PURPOSE: Currently, the use of cine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to identify  cardiac quiescent periods relative to the electrocardiogram (ECG) signal is insufficient for producing submillimeter-resolution coronary MR angiography (MRA) images. In this work, the authors perform a time series comparison between tissue Doppler echocardiograms of the interventricular septum (IVS) and concurrent biplane x-ray angiograms. Our results indicate very close agreement between the diastasis gating windows identified by both the IVS and x-ray techniques. METHODS: Seven cath lab patients undergoing diagnostic angiograms were simultaneously scanned during a breath hold by ultrasound and biplane x-ray for six to eight heartbeats. The heart rate of each patient was stable. Dye was injected into either the left or right-coronary vasculature. The IVS was imaged using color tissue Doppler in an apical four-chamber view. Diastasis was estimated on the IVS velocity curve. On the biplane angiograms, proximal, mid, and distal regions were identified on the coronary artery (CA). Frame by frame correlation was used to derive displacement, and then velocity, for each region. The quiescent periods for a CA and its subsegments were estimated based on velocity. Using Pearson's correlation coefficient and Bland-Altman analysis, the authors compared the start and end times of the diastasis windows as estimated from the IVS and CA velocities. The authors also estimated the vessel blur across the diastasis windows of multiple sequential heartbeats of each patient. RESULTS: In total, 17 heartbeats were analyzed. The range of heart rate observed across patients was 47-79 beats per minute (bpm) with a mean of 57 bpm. Significant correlations (R > 0.99; p < 0.01) were observed between the IVS and x-ray techniques for the identification of the start and end times of diastasis windows. The mean difference in the starting times between IVS and CA quiescent windows was -12.0 ms. The mean difference in end times between IVS and CA quiescent windows was -3.5 ms. In contrast, the correlation between RR interval and both the start and duration of the x-ray gating windows were relatively weaker: R = 0.63 (p = 0.13) and R = 0.86 (p = 0.01). For IVS gating windows, the average estimated vessel blurs during single and multiple heartbeats were 0.5 and 0.66 mm, respectively. For x-ray gating windows, the corresponding values were 0.26 and 0.44 mm, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the authors showed that IVS velocity can be used to identify periods of diastasis for coronary arteries. Despite variability in mid-diastolic rest positions over multiple steady rate heartbeats, vessel blurring of 0.5-1 mm was found to be achievable using the IVS gating technique. The authors envision this leading to a new cardiac gating system that, compared with conventional ECG gating, provides better resolution and shorter scan times for coronary MRA.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The theory of chaos proves a deterministic mechanism of induction of  multiple complex processes previously thought to be random in nature. This research explains how these complex processes develop. The aim of the study was to test the hypothesis of the chaotic nature of myocardial electrical events during ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation (VF). METHODS: Original hardware and software was developed for digitalization of on-line electrocardiography (ECG) data, with the functions of automatic and manual identification as well as categoriza-tion of specific ventricular arrhythmias. Patient ECGs were recorded by specially developed measuring equipment (M2TT). Available ECG sampling frequency was 20,000 Hz, and it was possible to analyze the signal retrospectively. Digital ECG of the sinus rhythm (SR) was analyzed with non-sustained VT, VT and VF. The signals were then subjected to mathematical analysis. Using wavelet analysis, signals carrying frequencies from various ranges were isolated from baseline and each of these isolated signals was subjected to Fourier transformation to check on differences in the Fourier power spectra of the analyzed VT and VF signals. RESULTS: Ventricular tachycardia identified based on ECG fulfills the criteria of a chaotic process, while no such properties were found for SR and VF. Information obtained by the ECG is used to record myo-cardial electrical signals, but they are not sufficient to differentiate between an advanced chaotic state and the process of linear expansion of electrical activation within the myocardium. CONCLUSIONS: Electrophysiological study requires advanced methods to record the signal of myocardial electrical activity, as ECG is not sufficiently sensitive to identify the features of a chaotic process during VF.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Yoga exercises are known to decrease stress and restore autonomic  balance. Yet knowledge about the physiological effects of inversion postures is limited. This study aimed to investigate the effects of inversion postures (head below the heart) on blood pressure (BP) and heart rate variability (HRV). METHODS: Twelve healthy women and men took part in an 8-week yoga program (60 min once a week). BP was measured with an automatic Omron mx3 oscillometric monitoring device and HRV with a Holter 24-hour ECG at baseline and 8 weeks after the intervention. RESULTS: There was no significant effect of inversion postures on BP. Nine out of 12 participants showed a significant increase in HRV (p < 0.05) at night (2 hours) on pNN50% (12.7 ± 12.5 to 18.2 ± 13.3). There were no significant changes in other HRV measures such as NN50, LF, HF, LF/HF ratio, LF normalized units (n.u.), HF n.u. and RMSSD. CONCLUSION: Eight weeks of hatha yoga improved HRV significantly which suggests an increased vagal tone and reduced sympathetic activity.

N2  - Vital parameter monitoring of term and preterm infants during incubator care with  self-adhesive electrodes or sensors directly positioned on the skin [e.g. photoplethysmography (PPG) for oxygen saturation or electrocardiography (ECG)] is an essential part of daily routine care in neonatal intensive care units. For various reasons, this kind of monitoring contains a lot of stress for the infants. Therefore, there is a need to measure vital parameters (for instance respiration, temperature, pulse, oxygen saturation) without mechanical or conductive contact. As a non-contact method of monitoring, we present an adapted version of camera-based photoplethysmography imaging (PPGI) according to neonatal requirements. Similar to classic PPG, the PPGI camera detects small temporal changes in the term and preterm infant's skin brightness due to the cardiovascular rhythm of dermal blood perfusion. We involved 10 preterm infants in a feasibility study [five males and five females; mean gestational age: 26 weeks (24-28 weeks); mean biological age: 35 days (8-41 days); mean weight at the time of investigation: 960 g (670-1290 g)]. The PPGI camera was placed directly above the incubators with the infant inside illuminated by an infrared light emitting diode (LED) array (850 nm). From each preterm infant, 5-min video sequences were recorded and analyzed post hoc. As the measurement scenario was kept as realistic as possible, the infants were not constrained in their movements in front of the camera. Movement intensities were assigned into five classes (1: no visible motion to 5: heavy struggling). PPGI was found to be significantly sensitive to movement artifacts. However, for movement classes 1-4, changes in blood perfusion according to the heart rate (HR) were recovered successfully (Pearson correlation: r=0.9759; r=0.765 if class 5 is included). The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Universal Hospital of the RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany (EK 254/13).

N2  - Unsupervised mining of electrocardiography (ECG) time series is a crucial task in  biomedical applications. To have efficiency of the clustering results, the prominent features extracted from preprocessing analysis on multiple ECG time series need to be investigated. In this paper, a Harmonic Linear Dynamical System is applied to discover vital prominent features via mining the evolving hidden dynamics and correlations in ECG time series. The discovery of the comprehensible and interpretable features of the proposed feature extraction methodology effectively represents the accuracy and the reliability of clustering results. Particularly, the empirical evaluation results of the proposed method demonstrate the improved performance of clustering compared to the previous main stream feature extraction approaches for ECG time series clustering tasks. Furthermore, the experimental results on real-world datasets show scalability with linear computation time to the duration of the time series.

N2  - Heart rate variability (HRV) analysis is widely used to investigate autonomous  cardiac drive. This method requires periodogram measurement, which can be obtained by an electrocardiogram (ECG) or from a heart rate monitor (HRM), e.g. the Garmin 920 XT device. The purpose of this investigation was to assess the accuracy of RR time series measurements from a Garmin 920 XT HRM as compared to a standard ECG, and to verify whether the measurements thus obtained are suitable for HRV analysis. RR time series were collected simultaneously with an ECG (Powerlab system, AD Instruments, Castell Hill, Australia) and a Garmin XT 920 in 11 healthy subjects during three conditions, namely in the supine position, the standing position and during moderate exercise. In a first step, we compared RR time series obtained with both tools using the Bland and Altman method to obtain the limits of agreement in all three conditions. In a second step, we compared the results of HRV analysis between the ECG RR time series and Garmin 920 XT series. Results show that the accuracy of this system is in accordance with the literature in terms of the limits of agreement. In the supine position, bias was 0.01, - 2.24, + 2.26 ms; in the standing position, - 0.01, - 3.12, + 3.11 ms respectively, and during exercise, - 0.01, - 4.43 and + 4.40 ms. Regarding HRV analysis, we did not find any difference for HRV analysis in the supine position, but the standing and exercise conditions both showed small modifications.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the impact of implementation of guidelines aimed at reducing  the use of laboratory and diagnostic preoperative tests in patients with low anesthesiologic risk, admitted to six public hospital of Ente Ospedaliero Cantonale in Cantone Ticino (Switzerland). DESIGN: Observational study. METHODS: Time series analysis of patterns of use of preoperative tests, on 14,585 patients admitted to public hospitals form March 1996 to June 1998. PRINCIPAL OUTCOME MEASURE: Proportion of patients undergoing a laboratory or other diagnostic tests during three six months periods before guidelines implementation (baseline), during the six months of the implementation phase and during the following four months of adoption of the guidelines in the participating centres. RESULTS: During the four months following the implementation, we observed a reduction of 15% (95% CI: 1%-27%) in the use of azotemia, and a reduction of 34% (95% CI: 18%-50%) for coagulation tests. Corresponding figures for glycemia and chest x-ray indicated a reduction of 44% (95% CI: 32%-54%) and of 22% (95% CI: 8%-34%), respectively. As for other tests (creatinine, ECG), no statistically significant reduction was observed. Most of the observed effect was explained by a reduction in use in patients at a low risk (ASA 1 and 2). In addition, guidelines appeared to have a greater impact in the four small (i.e. < 200 beds) hospitals, as compared with the two centres of greater size. CONCLUSIONS: Consistently with the empirical evidence available in this area, this study suggests that guidelines can change clinical practice, when they are implemented through a strategy taking into account adaptation of the recommendations to local circumstances and involvement of health professionals.

N2  - Automatic or semi-automatic analysis of the equine electrocardiogram (eECG) is  currently not possible because human or small animal ECG analysis software is unreliable due to a different ECG morphology in horses resulting from a different cardiac innervation. Both filtering, beat detection to classification for eECGs are currently poorly or not described in the literature. There are also no public databases available for eECGs as is the case for human ECGs. In this paper we propose the use of wavelet transforms for both filtering and QRS detection in eECGs. In addition, we propose a novel robust deep neural network using a parallel convolutional neural network architecture for ECG beat classification. The network was trained and tested using both the MIT-BIH arrhythmia and an own made eECG dataset with 26.440 beats on 4 classes: normal, premature ventricular contraction, premature atrial contraction and noise. The network was optimized using a genetic algorithm and an accuracy of 97.7% and 92.6% was achieved for the MIT-BIH and eECG database respectively. Afterwards, transfer learning from the MIT-BIH dataset to the eECG database was applied after which the average accuracy, recall, positive predictive value and F1 score of the network increased with an accuracy of 97.1%.

N2  - A novel approach for the nonlinear characterization of Electrocardiogram (ECG)  signals has been developed. The new developed methodology is based on a numerical algorithm that extracts the value of dinfinity (d-infinite) characterizing the asymptotic chaotic behavior of a system. This algorithm also extracts a measure of the maximum Lyapunov exponent and it is applicable to time series where the knowledge of the system structure and laws is not necessary. In order to prove the significance of the extracted parameters, the presented algorithm was applied on a statistically significant number of ECG signals taken from the MIT-BIH database and including normal subjects and subjects affected by arrhythmia and ventricular arrhythmia. A systematic study, analyzing how dinfinity varies with initial condition was performed showing the sensitivity of such parameter to the initial conditions. Furthermore, two maps, one presenting the maximum Lyapunov exponent and the other the dinfinity versus a control parameter II, as a measure of the rate variation, were drawn using the parameters extracted by the experimental data. They clearly show three distinguishable zones where the normal subjects and the subjects affected by the two different pathologies can be mapped and discriminated. Concluding, the newly presented algorithm, thanks to its implementation features and its effectiveness, it lends itself to future real-time implementation for clinical application in the early diagnosis of cardiac pathologies.

N2  - Automatic classification of the electrocardiogram (ECG) signals is an important  subject for clinical diagnosis of heart disease. This study investigates the design of a high-efficient system to classify five types of ECG beat namely normal beats and four manifestations of heart arrhythmia, in twofold. First, we propose a system that includes two main modules: a feature extraction module and a classification module. Feature extraction module extracts a suitable combination of the ECG's morphological characteristics and timing interval features. Discrete wavelet transform is used to extract the morphological features. In the classification module, a multi-class support vector machine (SVM)-based classifier is employed. The parameters of this system are determined based on a trial and error method and its performance is evaluated for the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database. Extensive experiments on the parameters of this system such as classifier kernels and various types of features are conducted. These experiments show that in SVM training, the kernels, kernel parameters, and feature selection have very important roles for SVM classification accuracy. Therefore, most appropriates of these parameters should be used for SVM training. Then at the second fold, a novel hybrid intelligent system (HIS) is proposed that consists of three main modules. In the HIS, further to the two mentioned modules, an optimization module is added. In this module, a genetic algorithm is used for optimization of the relevant parameters of system. These parameters are: wavelet filter type for feature extraction, wavelet decomposition level, and classifier's parameters. Experimental results show that optimization improves the recognition system, efficiently, and HIS is more superior to the system, which as constant parameters.

N2  - Myocardial infarction (MI) is a coronary artery disease acquired due to the lack of  blood supply in one or more sections of the myocardium, resulting in necrosis in that region. It has different types based on the region of necrosis. In this paper, a statistical approach for classification of Anteroseptal MI (ASMI) is proposed. The first step of the method involves noise elimination and feature extraction from the Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, using multi-resolution wavelet analysis and thresholding-based techniques. In the next step a classification scheme is developed using the nearest neighbour classification rule (NN rule). Both temporal and amplitude features relevant for automatic ASMI diagnosis are extracted from four chest leads v1-v4. The distance metric for NN classifier is calculated using both Euclidian distance and Mahalanobis distance. A relative comparison between these two techniques reveals that the later is superior to the former, as evident from the classification accuracy. The proposed method is tested and validated using the PTB diagnostic database. Classification accuracy for Mahalanobis distance and Euclidean distance-based NN rule are 95.14% and 81.83%, respectively.

N2  - There is a lack of standard methods for the analysis of magnetocardiograms (MCGs).  MCG signals have a shape similar to the ECG (P wave, QRS complex, T wave). High-quality multichannel recordings can indicate even slight disturbances of de- and repolarisation. The purpose of our study was to apply a new approach in the analysis of signal-averaged DC-MCGs. DC-MCGs (31-channel) were recorded in 182 subjects: 110 patients after myocardial infarction and 72 controls. Spatiotemporal correlation analysis of the QRS complex and T wave patterns throughout the entire heart cycle was used to analyse homogeneity of de- and repolarisation. These plots were compared to standard ECG analyses (electrical axis, Q wave, ST deviation, T polarity and shape). Spatiotemporal correlation analyses seem to be applicable in assessing the course of electrical repolarisation with respect to homogeneity. MCG provided all diagnostic information contained in common ECG recordings at high significance levels. The ECG patterns were included in 5/8 of our parameters for electrical axis, 6/8 for Q-wave, 7/8 for ST deviation and 5/8 for T-polarity based on two time series of correlation coefficients. We conclude that our spatiotemporal correlation approach provides a new tool for standardised analysis of cardiac mapping data such as MCG.

N2  - Analysis of heart rate variability (HRV) is performed through interbeat interval  time series derived from either electrocardiographic or arterial pressure (AP) recordings. However, little attention has been given to the reliability of calculating the time series from different sources, i.e. electrocardiogram (ECG) or pulse intervals (PI). Therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate the correlation between interbeat interval time series obtained from RR, inter-systolic (SS) and inter-diastolic (DD) intervals, as well as their impact on indices of HRV calculated from series of RR or PI. Conscious rats previously instrumented with subcutaneous electrodes and a catheter into the femoral artery were subjected to simultaneous ECG and AP recording for 5 min. Correlation and Bland-Altman plots between RR and PI were evaluated. Moreover, HRV was analyzed in time (mean cardiac interval, SDNN and RMSSD) and frequency domain (power in LF and HF spectral bands) as well as by nonlinear approaches (symbolic dynamics and sample entropy). First, RR showed a stronger correlation with PI calculated by DD than SS. Second, most HRV indices showed similar results when calculated with RR or DD series, but not with SS series. Considering RR interval as the gold standard for the calculation of cardiac cycle, when using PI inter diastolic intervals are the better choice to study HRV. These findings are quite relevant, especially when AP recording is used for HRV analysis.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: The fundus examination is a non-invasive evaluation of the  microcirculation of the retina. The aim of the present study is to develop and validate (reliability and validity) the ALTAIR software platform (Automatic image analyser to assess retinal vessel calibre) in order to analyse its utility in different clinical environments. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A cross-sectional study in the first phase and a prospective observational study in the second with 4 years of follow-up. The study will be performed in a primary care centre and will include 386 participants. The main measurements will include carotid intima-media thickness, pulse wave velocity by Sphygmocor, cardio-ankle vascular index through the VASERA VS-1500, cardiac evaluation by a digital ECG and renal injury by microalbuminuria and glomerular filtration. The retinal vascular evaluation will be performed using a TOPCON TRCNW200 non-mydriatic retinal camera to obtain digital images of the retina, and the developed software (ALTAIR) will be used to automatically calculate the calibre of the retinal vessels, the vascularised area and the branching pattern. For software validation, the intraobserver and interobserver reliability, the concurrent validity of the vascular structure and function, as well as the association between the estimated retinal parameters and the evolution or onset of new lesions in the target organs or cardiovascular diseases will be examined. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study has been approved by the clinical research ethics committee of the healthcare area of Salamanca. All study participants will sign an informed consent to agree to participate in the study in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the WHO standards for observational studies. Validation of this tool will provide greater reliability to the analysis of retinal vessels by decreasing the intervention of the observer and will result in increased validity through the use of additional information, especially in the areas of vascularisation and vessel branching patterns.

N2  - AIMS: To assess the yield of screening for atrial fibrillation (AF) with a hand-held  single-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) device during influenza vaccination in primary care in the Netherlands. METHODS AND RESULTS: We used the MyDiagnostick to screen for AF in persons who participated in influenza vaccination sessions of ten Dutch primary care practices. In case of suspected AF detection by the stick, the recorded 1-min ECG registrations were analysed by a cardiologist. We scrutinized electronic medical files of the general practitioners to obtain information about the cases screened. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to predict the relation between patient characteristics and a new screen-detected diagnosis of AF. In total, 3269 persons were screened for AF during the influenza vaccination sessions of 10 general practitioner practices. As a result, 37 (1.1%) new cases of AF were detected. Prior transient ischeamic attack or stroke (OR 6.05; 95%CI 1.93-19.0), and age (OR 1.09 per year; 95% CI 1.05-1.14) were independent predictors for such newly screen-detected AF. Of the 37 screen-detected AF cases, 2.7% had a CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc of 0, 18.9% a score of 1, and 78.4% a score of 2 or more. The majority needed oral anticoagulant therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Screening seems feasible with an easy to use single-lead, hand-held ECG device with automatic AF detection during influenza vaccination in primary care and results in a '1-day' yield of 1.1% new cases of AF.

N2  - Every 4 hours for 24 hours, 14 clinically healthy young individuals (6 women and 8  men), 26 +/- 4 years of age, measured systolic (S) and diastolic (D) blood pressure (BP) by sphygmomanometer and heart rate by ECG and did impedance cardiography under usual living conditions. Stroke volume (SV), cardiac output (CO) and total peripheral resistance (TPR) were calculated. Time series of SBP, DBP, HR, SV, CO and TPR were analyzed by single and population-mean cosinor. A circadian cardiovascular rhythm is demonstrated by rejection of the zero amplitude assumption in the population-mean cosinor test for SBP, DBP, HR, SV, CO and TPR (P < 0.01). TPR peaks around 0400 (-61 degrees from local midnight), in antiphase with all other variables, their acrophase occurring around 1600 (-240 degrees). A circadian rhythm of statistical significance or of borderline statistical significance is found for all variables except TPR in women. Circadian rhythm characteristics were otherwise mostly similar in men and women with a statistically significant gender difference found by parameter tests only for the MESOR and amplitude of SBP.

N2  - Fractal analysis is a new tool allowing to study the complexity of cardiovascular  variability. This approach may be useful for investigating regulatory mechanisms. In fractal terms, homeostasis required an optimal organisation of complexity (beta coefficient close to 1): conversely, some pathological situations have proven to be associated with an altered organisation of fractals (beta coefficient different from 1). Our study aimed at determining if hypertension was associated with an alteration of the fractal component of blood pressure (BP) or heart rate (HR) variability. Eighty-eight subjects referred for high BP entered the study. BP was measured in ambulatory conditions by an automatic device during 24 hours (ABP). BP and HR were then recorded beat-to-beat by a Finapres and an ECG during 30 minutes at rest. The beta coefficient was obtained by coarse-graining spectral analysis from the BP and RR interval time series. This method has proven its interest for breaking down cardiovascular variability into an harmonic component and a non harmonic one, this latter containing fractal elements. Spontaneous baroreflex sensitivity was assessed by the method of sequences. The percentage of fractals contained in BP and RR signals remained relatively stable despite the increasing severity of hypertension. A significant but loose correlation was found between the beta coefficient of RR and ABP (r = 0.23, p = 0.053 with systolic ABP; r = 0.25, p = 0.03 with diastolic ABP). No correlation could be disclosed between ABP and the beta coefficient of BP. The beta coefficient of RR was significantly correlated with the spontaneous baroreflex sensitivity (-0.59, p < 0.0001). It is concluded that it is rather the complexity of HR signal than that of BP which is altered during hypertension. This may suggest that some regulatory processes are lost or less efficient. The correlation reported between the baroreflex gain and the beta coefficient of RR interval may reflect, in fact, an alteration of the parasympathetic drive. Globally, these results emphasise the importance of HR and probably cardiac output in the pathophysiology of high BP.

N2  - AIM: Chest compression artefacts impede a reliable rhythm analysis during  cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). These artefacts are not present during ventilations in 30:2 CPR. The aim of this study is to prove that a fully automatic method for rhythm analysis during ventilation pauses in 30:2 CPR is reliable an accurate. METHODS: For this study 1414min of 30:2 CPR from 135 out-of-hospital cardiac arrest cases were analysed. The data contained 1942 pauses in compressions longer than 3.5s. An automatic pause detector identified the pauses using the transthoracic impedance, and a shock advice algorithm (SAA) diagnosed the rhythm during the detected pauses. The SAA analysed 3-s of the ECG during each pause for an accurate shock/no-shock decision. RESULTS: The sensitivity and PPV of the pause detector were 93.5% and 97.3%, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of the SAA in the detected pauses were 93.8% (90% low CI, 90.0%) and 95.9% (90% low CI, 94.7%), respectively. Using the method, shocks would have been advanced in 97% of occasions. For patients in nonshockable rhythms, rhythm reassessment pauses would be avoided in 95.2% (95% CI, 91.6-98.8) of occasions, thus increasing the overall chest compression fraction (CCF). CONCLUSION: An automatic method could be used to safely analyse the rhythm during ventilation pauses. This would contribute to an early detection of refibrillation, and to increase CCF in patients with nonshockable rhythms.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The conventional method for ventilation is supported by accommodative or  adaptive support ventilation (ASV) that the latter method is done with two methods: ASV minute ventilation (mv): 110% and ASV mv: 120%. Regarding these methods this study compared the differences in duration of mechanical ventilation and hemodynamic changes during recovery and length of stay in Intensive Care Units (ICU). MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a clinical trial study, forty patients candidate for ventilation were selected and randomly divided into two groups of A and B. All patients were ventilated by Rafael ventilator. Ventilator parameters were set on ASV mv: 110% or ASV mv: 120% and patients were monitored on pulse oximetry, electrocardiography monitoring, central vein pressure and arterial pressure. Finally, the data entered to computer and analyzed by SPSS software. RESULTS: The time average of connection to ventilator in two groups in modes of ASV mv: 110% and 120% was 12.3 ± 3.66 and 10.8 ± 2.07 days respectively, and according to t-test, there was no significant difference between two groups (P = 0.11). The average of length of stay in ICU in two groups of 110% and 120% was 16.35 ± 3.51 and 15.5 ± 2.62 days respectively, and according to t-test, there found to be no significant difference between two groups (P = 0.41). CONCLUSION: Using ASV mv: 120% can decrease extubation time compared with ASV mv: 110%. Furthermore, there is not a considerable side effect on hemodynamic of patients.

N2  - Real-time Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) episode detection and monitoring are  important for society in terms of an improvement in the health of the general population and of a reduction in mortality and healthcare costs. Currently, to diagnose OSA patients undergo PolySomnoGraphy (PSG), a complicated and invasive test to be performed in a specialized center involving many sensors and wires. Accordingly, each patient is required to stay in the same position throughout the duration of one night, thus restricting their movements. This paper proposes an easy, cheap, and portable approach for the monitoring of patients with OSA, which collects single-channel ElectroCardioGram (ECG) data only. It is easy to perform from the patient's point of view because only one wearable sensor is required, so the patient is not restricted to keeping the same position all night long, and the detection and monitoring can be carried out in any place through the use of a mobile device. Our approach is based on the automatic extraction, from a database containing information about the monitored patient, of explicit knowledge in the form of a set of IF…THEN rules containing typical parameters derived from Heart Rate Variability (HRV) analysis. The extraction is carried out off-line by means of a Differential Evolution algorithm. This set of rules can then be exploited in the real-time mobile monitoring system developed at our Laboratory: the ECG data is gathered by a wearable sensor and sent to a mobile device, where it is processed in real time. Subsequently, HRV-related parameters are computed from this data, and, if their values activate some of the rules describing the occurrence of OSA, an alarm is automatically produced. This approach has been tested on a well-known literature database of OSA patients. The numerical results show its effectiveness in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, and the achieved sets of rules evidence the user-friendliness of the approach. Furthermore, the method is compared against other well known classifiers, and its discrimination ability is shown to be higher.

N2  - In this paper, we use the CUR matrix factorization as a means of dimension reduction  to identify important subsequences in electrocardiogram (ECG) time series. As opposed to other factorizations typically used in dimension reduction that characterize data in terms of abstract representatives (for example, an orthogonal basis), the CUR factorization describes the data in terms of actual instances within the original data set. Therefore, the CUR characterization can be directly related back to the clinical setting. We apply CUR to a synthetic ECG data set as well as to data from the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia, MGH-MF, and Incart databases using the discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM) and an incremental QR factorization. In doing so, we demonstrate that CUR is able to identify beat morphologies that are representative of the data set, including rare-occurring beat events, providing a robust summarization of the ECG data. We also see that using CUR-selected beats to label the remaining unselected beats via 1-nearest neighbor classification produces results comparable to those presented in other works. While the electrocardiogram is of particular interest here, this work demonstrates the utility of CUR in detecting representative subsequences in quasiperiodic physiological time series.

N2  - Over 10 years ago, the standards for cardiac monitoring were set forth by the  Councils on Cardiovascular Nursing, Clinical Cardiology, and Cardiovascular Disease in the Young. The standards were endorsed by the International Society of Computerized Electrocardiology and the American Association of Critical-Care Nurses. The American Heart Association printed the standards as an American Heart Association Scientific Statement. The standards provided direction related to remote telemetry monitoring to acute care hospitals. Since the standards were published, remote monitoring of cardiac patients has increased dramatically prompting research and literature related to appropriate utilization. Appropriate and safe telemetry monitoring requires clearly written evidence-based facility policies. This article describes the process whereby a team of Veterans Hospital Administration nurses from across the country reviewed 70 remote telemetry policies representing 75 Veterans Hospital Administration hospitals for clarity, consistency, and congruency to existing levels of evidence found in the literature. This article describes the processes, successes, and challenges of compiling an evidence-based remote telemetry policy guideline.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common supraventricular arrhythmia.  ECG-gated MDCT seems to be currently a method of choice for pre-ablation anatomical mapping due to an excellent resolution and truly isotropic three-dimensional nature. The aim of this study was to establish the between-subject variability and inter-observer reproducibility of anatomical evaluation of the pulmonary veins (PV) and the left atrium (LA) using computed tomography. MATERIAL/METHODS: A retrospective analysis included 42 patients with AF, who were scheduled for a cardiac CT for ablation planning. Images were assessed by two independent radiologists using a semi-automatic software tool. The left atrium anatomy (volume, AP diameter), anatomy of the pulmonary veins (number, ostia diameters and surface area) were evaluated. The relative between-subject variability and the inter-observer variability of measurements were calculated. RESULTS: The heart rate during scanning ranged from 50 to 133/min. (mean 79.1/min.) and all examinations were of adequate image quality. Accessory pulmonary veins were found in 24% of patients. Between-subject variability of the PV ostial cross-sectional area ranged from 33% to 48%. The variability of the left atrium size was 21% for the diameter and 35% for the volume. The inter-observer agreement for the detection of accessory pulmonary veins was good (κ=0.73; 95% CI, 0.54-0.93). CONCLUSIONS: Between-subject variability of the pulmonary vein ostial cross-sectional area and the left artial volume is substantial. The anatomical assessment of the pulmonary vein ostia and the left atrium size in computed tomography presents a good inter-observer reproducibility.

Vast amounts of smart health big data from ubiquitous sensors pose unprecedented challenges to the security and privacy protection, which is extremely critical in healthcare applications. The vital signs, user daily behaviors, medicine recommendations, and so many other health data are vulnerable to different attacks, due to the fact that wearable/mobile monitors have very strict performance/power constraints, which limit the complexity of security protocols. In this paper, we study how to leverage a natural vital signal (Electrocardiogram - ECG) for user identification purpose, without introducing new hardware sensing devices. ECG is not only a gold standard cardiac signal, but also unique to each individual. We investigate a phase-domain deep patient-ECG image learning framework, to tackle key challenges in ECG biometric user identification: high diversities of ECG morphologies due to heart diseases, and time-consuming/ineffective heartbeat localization methods & manual feature engineering. The ultimate goal is to make the smart health security zero-effort: use `phase-domain transformation' to enable blind signal segmentation without localizing heartbeats; create a computer image processing-like task by `pixelating' phase-domain ECG trajectories to ECG images; and enable automatic (non-manual) `deep feature learning' using a deep convolutional neural network. Evaluated on two patient-ECG databases, this zero-effort framework achieves an accuracy as high as 97.2%, and greatly outperforms state-of-the-art studies in terms of the generalization ability and/or performance. This study is expected to enable highly challenging patient-ECG biometric user identification, by generalizable blind signal segmentation and deep feature learning strategies, in the era of smart health boosted by internet of medical things and big medical data.

N2  - Biomedical time series clustering that groups a set of unlabelled temporal signals  according to their underlying similarity is very useful for biomedical records management and analysis such as biosignals archiving and diagnosis. In this paper, a new framework for clustering of long-term biomedical time series such as electrocardiography (ECG) and electroencephalography (EEG) signals is proposed. Specifically, local segments extracted from the time series are projected as a combination of a small number of basis elements in a trained dictionary by non-negative sparse coding. A Bag-of-Words (BoW) representation is then constructed by summing up all the sparse coefficients of local segments in a time series. Based on the BoW representation, a probabilistic topic model that was originally developed for text document analysis is extended to discover the underlying similarity of a collection of time series. The underlying similarity of biomedical time series is well captured attributing to the statistic nature of the probabilistic topic model. Experiments on three datasets constructed from publicly available EEG and ECG signals demonstrates that the proposed approach achieves better accuracy than existing state-of-the-art methods, and is insensitive to model parameters such as length of local segments and dictionary size.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this article is to assess whether iopamidol-370 provides  superior vascular contrast of the coronaries and depiction of anatomic detail without affecting heart rate and beat-to-beat variability during coronary dual-source MDCT compared with iodixanol-320. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: In this prospective trial, coronary CT angiography was performed on 60 adult patients using either iopamidol-370 or iodixanol-320. Cohorts were matched by age, habitus, sex, and baseline heart rate, with cohort sizes determined by power analysis. All studies were performed on a dual-source MDCT scanner with retrospective ECG-gating utilizing automatic pitch adjustment. Data assessment focused on heart rate variability during contrast administration statistically evaluated as Student t test comparisons within and between cohorts, coronary contrast-to-noise ratio analysis of the main coronary arteries utilizing Student t test comparisons between cohorts, and coronary branch depiction and distribution analysis in dual-reader consensus decisions between cohorts. RESULTS: Thirty patients matched for age, habitus, sex, and heart rate were evaluated in each cohort. ECG analyses found a statistically significant (p = 0.013) decrease in heart rate during administration of iodixanol-320. Beat-to-beat variations, expressed as coefficient of variation, within and among cohorts were low (coefficient of variation, < 0.05). Contrast-to-noise ratio was significantly increased for iopamidol-370 versus iodixanol-320 (aortic root, p = 0.021; left main, p = 0.032; left anterior descending, p = 0.033; left circumflex, p = 0.039; and right, p = 0.009). Analysis of coronary branch visualization revealed improved depiction for iopamidol-370 compared with iodixanol-320. CONCLUSION: Iopamidol-370, with its higher iodine concentration, provided greater vascular contrast of the arterial coronary tree and improved depiction of anatomic detail without significantly impacting cardiac heart rate during coronary MDCT imaging, as compared with iodixanol-320.

N2  - BACKGROUND: With recent technology, multivariate time-series electrocardiogram (ECG)  analysis has played an important role in diagnosing cardiovascular diseases. However, discovering the association of wide range aging disease and chronic habit with ECG analysis still has room to be explored. This article mainly analyzes the possible relationship between common aging diseases or chorionic habits of medical record and ECG, such as diabetes, obesity, and hypertension, or the habit of smoking. METHODS: In the research, we first conducted different ECG features, such as those of reduced binary pattern, waveform, and wavelet and then performed a k-means clustering analysis on the correlation between ECGs and the aforementioned diseases and habits, from which it is expected to find a firm association between them and the best characteristics that can be used for future research. RESULTS: In summary, we discovered a weak and strong evidence between ECG and medical records. For strong evidence, most patients with diabetes are always assigned into a specified group no matter the number of classes in the k-means clustering, which means we can find their association between them. For weak evidence, smokers, obesity, and hypertension have less unique ECG feature vector, enabling clustering them into specific groups, so the ECGs might be used to identify smokers, obesity, and hypertension. It is also interesting that we found obesity and hypertension, which are thought to be related to cardiovascular system. However, they are not highly correlated in our clustering analysis, which might indirectly tell us that the impact of obesity and hypertension to our body is various. In addition, the clustering effect of waveform feature is better than the other two methods.

N2  - The central nervous system regulates recruitment and firing of motor units to  modulate muscle tension. Estimation of the firing rate time series is typically performed by decomposing the electromyogram (EMG) into its constituent firing times, then lowpass filtering a constituent train of impulses. Little research has examined the performance of different estimation methods, particularly in the inevitable presence of decomposition errors. The study of electrocardiogram (ECG) and electroneurogram (ENG) firing rate time series presents a similar problem, and has applied novel simulation models and firing rate estimators. Herein, we adapted an ENG/ECG simulation model to generate realistic EMG firing times derived from known rates, and assessed various firing rate time series estimation methods. ENG/ECG-inspired rate estimation worked exceptionally well when EMG decomposition errors were absent, but degraded unacceptably with decomposition error rates of ⩾1%. Typical EMG decomposition error rates-even after expert manual review-are 3-5%. At realistic decomposition error rates, more traditional EMG smoothing approaches performed best, when optimal smoothing window durations were selected. This optimal window was often longer than the 400ms duration that is commonly used in the literature. The optimal duration decreased as the modulation frequency of firing rate increased, average firing rate increased and decomposition errors decreased. Examples of these rate estimation methods on physiologic data are also provided, demonstrating their influence on measures computed from the firing rate estimate.

N2  - In this study, a linear parametric modeling technique was applied to model  ventricular repolarization (VR) dynamics. Three features were selected from the surface ECG recordings to investigate the changes in VR dynamics in healthy and cardiac autonomic neuropathy (CAN) participants with diabetes including heart rate variability (calculated from RR intervals), repolarization variability (calculated from QT intervals), and respiration [calculated by ECG-derived respiration (EDR)]. Surface ECGs were recorded in a supine resting position from 80 age-matched participants (40 with no cardiac autonomic neuropathy (NCAN) and 40 with CAN). In the CAN group, 25 participants had early/subclinical CAN (ECAN) and 15 participants were identified with definite/clinical CAN (DCAN). Detecting subclinical CAN is crucial for designing an effective treatment plan to prevent further cardiovascular complications. For CAN diagnosis, VR dynamics was analyzed using linear parametric autoregressive bivariate (ARXAR) and trivariate (ARXXAR) models, which were estimated using 250 beats of derived QT, RR, and EDR time series extracted from the first 5 min of the recorded ECG signal. Results showed that the EDR-based models gave a significantly higher fitting value (p < 0.0001) than models without EDR, which indicates that QT-RR dynamics is better explained by respiratory-information-based models. Moreover, the QT-RR-EDR model fitting values gradually decreased from the NCAN group to ECAN and DCAN groups, which indicate a decoupling of QT from RR and the respiration signal with the increase in severity of CAN. In this study, only the EDR-based model significantly distinguished ECAN and DCAN groups from the NCAN group (p < 0.05) with large effect sizes (Cohen's d > 0.75) showing the effectiveness of this modeling technique in detecting subclinical CAN. In conclusion, the EDR-based trivariate QT-RR-EDR model was found to be better in detecting the presence and severity of CAN than the bivariate QT-RR model. This finding also establishes the importance of adding respiratory information for analyzing the gradual deterioration of normal VR dynamics in pathological conditions, such as diabetic CAN.

N2  - Psychiatric symptoms are often accompanied by somatic symptoms induced by the  activity of the autonomic nervous system (ANS). The aim of this study was to calculate the time lag between electroencephalography (EEG) and electrocardiography (ECG) responses, to clarify the changes in the relationship between the cerebral cortex (CC) and the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) during emotional recall processing. Twenty-two healthy young adults were examined. Their EEG and ECG data were simultaneously recorded during emotional audiovisual recall tasks using pleasant and unpleasant stimuli for 180 s, with three repetitions (Epochs 1 & 2 and Epoch 3). The EEG data were analyzed using a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to obtain a time series of relative power spectra, XE, in the theta 1, theta 2, alpha 1, alpha 2, alpha 3, beta 1, beta 2, and beta 3 bands. Time series of RR (inter-beat) intervals (time intervals between successive R waves) derived from the ECG spectral analysis using FFT was applied to the resampled time series of RR intervals over about 60 s to obtain a time series of power spectra for the ratio low frequency/high frequency (LH/HF), XC, which reflects the activity of the sympathetic nervous function. The time lag between XE and XC was calculated using wavelet-crosscorrelation analysis. The results demonstrated that the brain responded to unfamiliar emotionally pleasant stimuli in Epochs 1 & 2 earlier than the SNS, whereas the brain and SNS responded to unfamiliar unpleasant stimuli nearly simultaneously. The brain was activated rapidly in response to familiar unpleasant stimuli, although SNS responded more rapidly to familiar pleasant stimuli than the brain in Epoch 3. Our results quantitatively describe the relationship between the CC and the ANS during emotional recall.

N2  - 30 young males performed inspiratory breath holdings during expectation of an  aversive stimulus and at relative rest. The consecutive R-R intervals of the ECG from breath-hold trial were analysed via spectral analysis of time series. Following parameters were ascertained for each breath holding: mean R-R interval, total R-R interval variability, breath-hold time and relative variability in three spectral bands 3-8 s, 8-12 s and 12-18 s. Neither of these variables was influenced by expectation of an aversive stimulus. The data were subsequently analysed by means of multivariate analysis. Three distinct frequency components were selected according to both histogram data and multivariate analysis. Their modal periods were 5-6 s, 12 s and 16 s respectively. The 8-12 s component of R-R interval variability dominated during breath holdings. The 3-8 s band bore a negative relationship to breath-hold time.

N2  - In this letter, the authors propose a new entropy measure for analysis of time  series. This measure is termed as the state space correlation entropy (SSCE). The state space reconstruction is used to evaluate the embedding vectors of a time series. The SSCE is computed from the probability of the correlations of the embedding vectors. The performance of SSCE measure is evaluated using both synthetic and real valued signals. The experimental results reveal that, the proposed SSCE measure along with SVM classifier have sensitivity value of 91.60%, which is higher than the performance of both sample entropy and permutation entropy features for detection of shockable ventricular arrhythmia.

N2  - As the very first trial of mobile telemedicine in the Republic of Georgia, in  June-December 2010 we investigated 35 outpatients with different types of arrhythmia (male/female ratio=16/19; 12-80 years old), among them 5 patients with concomitant epilepsy. The control group comprised 7 clinically healthy sportsmen (soccer players, all men; 15-17 years old), during a 30-min velo ergometer stress test. A three-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) loop recorder (Vitaphone BT 3300; Vitasystems GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) was used in automatic mode, using special LRMA software (MDT, Lázně Bohdaneč, Czech Republic) and a Nokia (Espoo, Finland) model 6730 Symbian phone. Automatically recorded arrhythmia events were transmitted from the loop recorder by Bluetooth(®) (Bluetooth SIG, Inc., Kirkland, WA) to a phone and then by 3G (through our partner mobile operator, MagtiCom Ltd. [Tbilsi, Georgia]) to the Vitasystems server in Germany and were available to Georgian physicians via e-mail/Internet. Arrhythmias were recorded/monitored during 7-68 h of observation. The number of automatically recorded ECG events varied between 3 and 170 per observation, or 0.4-10.7 hourly. Cases of sinus brady- and tachyarrhythmia, sinus node weakness syndrome, atrial fibrillation, supraventricular tachycardia, supraventricular premature complexes, and ventricular premature complexes were correctly recognized by automatic recognition software and recorded. In 3 patients and 1 sportsman previously unspecified (despite multiple investigations), arrhythmias were recorded: paroxysmal tachycardia (n=1), sinus node weakness syndrome (n=1), and ventricular premature complexes (n=2). In 3 cases (all women) light insomnia and nervousness were reported. In 2 patients with neurosis (both elderly men, 1 with epilepsy) we had to stop investigation prematurely because of anxiety/agitation. Mobile telecardiology represents feasible methodology to monitor arrhythmias in outpatients in Georgia, promoting earlier discharge of non-life-threatening cases, improving patients' comfort of life, and increasing their mobility with enhanced safety. Mobile telehealth might also represent significant cost-saving for insurance companies (this is an ongoing study). Finally, in remote areas mobile telemonitoring of patients will improve quality of care by timely provision of a second opinion in cases when local expertise is not sufficient.

N2  - Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common sleep disorder that affects 24% of adult  men and 9% of adult women. It occurs due to the occlusion of the upper airway during sleep, thereby leading to a decrease of blood oxygen level that triggers arousals and sleep fragmentation. OSA significantly impacts the quality of sleep and it is known to be responsible for a number of health complications, such as high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes. Traditional diagnosis of OSA relies on polysomnography, which is expensive, time-consuming and inaccessible to the general population. Recent advancement of sensing provides an unprecedented opportunity for the screening of OSA events using single-channel electrocardiogram (ECG). However, existing approaches are limited in their ability to characterize nonlinear dynamics underlying ECG signals. As such, hidden patterns of OSA-altered cardiac electrical activity cannot be fully revealed and understood. This paper presents a new heterogeneous recurrence model to characterize the heart rate variability for the identification of OSA. A nonlinear state space is firstly reconstructed from a time series of RR intervals that are extracted from single-channel ECGs. Further, the state space is recursively partitioned into a hierarchical structure of local recurrence regions. A new fractal representation is designed to efficiently characterize state transitions among segmented sub-regions. Statistical measures are then developed to quantify heterogeneous recurrence patterns. In addition, we integrate classification models with heterogeneous recurrence features to differentiate healthy subjects from OSA patients. Experimental results show that the proposed approach captures heterogeneous recurrence patterns in the transformed space and provides an effective tool to detect OSA using one-lead ECG signals.

N2  - Standard clinical care in neonatal and pediatric intensive-care units (NICUs and  PICUs, respectively) involves continuous monitoring of vital signs with hard-wired devices that adhere to the skin and, in certain instances, can involve catheter-based pressure sensors inserted into the arteries. These systems entail risks of causing iatrogenic skin injuries, complicating clinical care and impeding skin-to-skin contact between parent and child. Here we present a wireless, non-invasive technology that not only offers measurement equivalency to existing clinical standards for heart rate, respiration rate, temperature and blood oxygenation, but also provides a range of important additional features, as supported by data from pilot clinical studies in both the NICU and PICU. These new modalities include tracking movements and body orientation, quantifying the physiological benefits of skin-to-skin care, capturing acoustic signatures of cardiac activity, recording vocal biomarkers associated with tonality and temporal characteristics of crying and monitoring a reliable surrogate for systolic blood pressure. These platforms have the potential to substantially enhance the quality of neonatal and pediatric critical care.

N2  - Heart failure (HF) is one of the most frequent heart diseases. It is usually  characterized with structural and functional cardiac abnormalities followed by dysfunction of autonomic cardiac control. Current methods of heartbeat interval analysis are not capable to differentiate HF patients and some new differentiation of HF patients could be useful in the determination of the direction of their treatment. In this study, we examined potential of the ratio of the short-term and long-term scaling exponents (α (1) and α (2)) to separate HF patients with similar level of reduced cardiac autonomic nervous system control and with no significant difference in age, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and NYHA class. Thirty-five healthy control subjects and 46 HF patients underwent 20 min of continuous supine resting ECG recording. The interbeat interval time series were analyzed using standardized power spectrum analysis, detrended fluctuation analysis method and standard Poincaré plot (PP) analysis with measures of asymmetry of the PP. Compared with healthy control group, in HF patients linear measures of autonomic cardiac control were statistically significantly reduced (p < 0.05), heart rate asymmetry was preserved (C (up) > C (down), p < 0.01), and long-term scaling exponent α (2) was significantly higher. Cluster analysis of the ratio of short- and long-term scaling exponents showed capability of this parameter to separate four clusters of HF patients. Clusters were determined by interplay of presence of short-term and long-term correlations in interbeat intervals. Complementary measure, commonly accepted ratio of the PP descriptors, SD2/SD1, showed tendency toward statistical significance to separate HF patients in obtained clusters. Also, heart rate asymmetry was preserved only in two clusters. Finally, a multiple regression analysis showed that the ratio α (1)/α (2) could be used as an integrated measure of cardiac dynamic with complex physiological background which, besides spectral components as measures of autonomic cardiac control, also involves breathing frequency and mechanical cardiac parameter, left ventricular ejection fraction.

N2  - BACKGROUND: By gating image acquisition in myocardial perfusion SPECT (MPS) to ECG,  left ventricular (LV) volumes and function can be determined. Several previous studies have shown that existing MPS software packages underestimate LV volumes compared to cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR). The aim of this study was therefore to develop a new LV segmentation algorithm for gated MPS using CMR as reference standard. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 126 patients with suspected coronary artery disease, who underwent both gated MPS and CMR were retrospectively included. The proposed LV segmentation algorithm (Segment) was trained in 26 patients, and tested in 100 patients in comparison to four commercially available MPS software packages (QGS, MyoMetrix, ECTb, and Exini) using CMR as reference standard. Mean bias ± SD between MPS and CMR was for EDV -5% ± 12%, -43% ± 8%, -40% ± 8%, -42% ± 9%, -32% ± 7%, for ESV 0% ± 17%, -41% ± 16%, -34% ± 15%, -54% ± 13%, -41% ± 10%, for EF -2% ± 13%, -1% ± 14%, -7% ± 15%, 17% ± 16%, 10% ± 17% for Segment, QGS, MyoMetrix, ECTb, and Exini, respectively, and for LVM 3% ± 18%, 33% ± 25%, 37% ± 24% for Segment, QGS, and ECTb, respectively. Correlation between MPS by Segment and CMR were for EDV R (2) = 0.89, for ESV R (2) = 0.92, for EF R (2) = 0.69, and for LVM R (2) = 0.72, with no difference compared to the correlation between the other MPS software packages and CMR (EDV R (2) = 0.86-0.92, ESV R (2) = 0.91-0.93, EF R (2) = 0.64-0.65, and LVM R (2) = 0.68-0.70). CONCLUSION: The Segment software quantifies LV volumes and EF by MPS with similar correlation and a low bias compared to other MPS software packages, using CMR as reference standard. Hence, the Segment software shows potential to provide clinically relevant volumes and functional values from MPS.

N2  - To measure pulse transit times (PTT) and calculate pulse wave velocities (PWV),  tri-axial and uniaxial accelerometers were placed in groups of 2 to 4 over the manubrium, xiphoid process, forehead, wrist and ankle, and/or over the carotid, femoral, and posterior auricular arteries in 11 consented supine subjects. Signals were sampled at 1 kHz and filtered. Radial vectors were calculated from the tri-axial measurements. A 3-lead ECG was simultaneously collected over the same 180 s window, as well as respiratory rate. Ensemble averages (with ±S.D.) and raster plots were generated for each filtered time series from 200 ms before to 800 ms after the peak of each ECG R-wave. Lag times between the R-wave peak (taken as t=0) and one or more prominent peaks (or valleys if appropriate) of the various accelerometer signals were calculated, by using the signal from the axis (or the radial vector) with the best signal to noise ratio. PWV was calculated from the regression of the distance measured versus the PTT between pairs, especially of the clinically-relevant carotid-femoral PTT. A spectral analysis of each ensemble was taken, with the hypothesis that in young adults the measures at the periphery would have less energy at higher frequencies than those of an older adult because of age-related changes in arterial distensibility.

N2  - The incidence of heart disease increases with age. The typical method of monitoring  arrhythmia is to use a body patch type sensor with a wet electrode. Even though this sensor is easy to use, it has several disadvantages such as problems caused by wet electrodes in tissues when they are monitored for long periods. Thus, a monitoring sensor integrated into clothes with a dry electrode is proposed. In this study, we developed a smart outdoor shirt equipped with a dry electrode electrocardiogram (ECG) sensor for a cardiac arrhythmia computer-aided diagnosis system. The sensor can be inserted in a console close to the chest, charged, used to communicate wirelessly, and can be connected to a smartphone application. According to experiments, the ECG signals measured by the smart shirt indicated that 97.5 ± 1% of the signals could be measured in an immobile state and at least 85.2 ± 2% of the signals could be measured during movement. In addition, we propose a computer-aided diagnosis system for detecting cardiac arrhythmia. It was determined through experiments that the system can detect arrhythmia with an accuracy of 98.2 ± 2%.

N2  - The complex interactions that give rise to heart rate variability (HRV) involve  coupled physiological oscillators operating over a wide range of different frequencies and length-scales. Based on the premise that interactions are key to the functioning of complex systems, the time-dependent deterministic coupling parameters underlying cardiac, respiratory and vascular regulation have been investigated at both the central and microvascular levels. Hypertension was considered as an example of a globally altered state of the complex dynamics of the cardiovascular system. Its effects were established through analysis of simultaneous recordings of the electrocardiogram (ECG), respiratory effort, and microvascular blood flow [by laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF)]. The signals were analyzed by methods developed to capture time-dependent dynamics, including the wavelet transform, wavelet-based phase coherence, non-linear mode decomposition, and dynamical Bayesian inference, all of which can encompass the inherent frequency and coupling variability of living systems. Phases of oscillatory modes corresponding to the cardiac (around 1.0 Hz), respiratory (around 0.25 Hz), and vascular myogenic activities (around 0.1 Hz) were extracted and combined into two coupled networks describing the central and peripheral systems, respectively. The corresponding spectral powers and coupling functions were computed. The same measurements and analyses were performed for three groups of subjects: healthy young (Y group, 24.4 ± 3.4 y), healthy aged (A group, 71.1 ± 6.6 y), and aged treated hypertensive patients (ATH group, 70.3 ± 6.7 y). It was established that the degree of coherence between low-frequency oscillations near 0.1 Hz in blood flow and in HRV time series differs markedly between the groups, declining with age and nearly disappearing in treated hypertension. Comparing the two healthy groups it was found that the couplings to the cardiac rhythm from both respiration and vascular myogenic activity decrease significantly in aging. Comparing the data from A and ATH groups it was found that the coupling from the vascular myogenic activity is significantly weaker in treated hypertension subjects, implying that the mechanisms of microcirculation are not completely restored by current anti-hypertension medications.

N2  - Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common health issue, not only in developed countries  but also in developing ones. AF can lead to strokes, heart failures, and even death if it is not diagnosed and treated on time, therefore automatic detection of AF is an urgent need, particularly using Internet- connected devices that can alert healthcare services. Detection of AF typically involves the analysis of electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings, where P-waves that characterize the atrial activity are substituted with f-waves of variable amplitude and duration. In this paper, we used the discrete wavelet transform to decompose the ECG signal into detail and approximation coefficients with different time-frequency resolutions. Features extracted from ECG signals, RR interval time series and detail and approximation coefficients were used as inputs to an artificial neural network trained to identify four classes of heart rhythms: normal sinus rhythm (NSR), AF, other rhythms (OR) and noisy signals (NS). By performing a Monte Carlo 10- fold cross-validation of 10 iterations approach, average micro F(1) scores of 83.64%, 61.61%, 56.88% and 53.88% to classify NSR, AF, OR and NS respectively, and average macro F(1) of 64.00% were obtained on the publicly available training set of PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2017. In addition, in a one-vs.-the-rest strategy, i.e., AF-vs-the-rest, averages sensitivity and specificity of 95.70% and 72.39% respectively were achieved to classify AF recordings.

N2  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: Up to 5% of adults in Western countries have undiagnosed  sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). Studies have shown that electrocardiogram (ECG)-based algorithms can identify SDB and may provide alternative screening. Most studies, however, have limited generalizability as they have been conducted using the apnea-ECG database, a small sample database that lacks complex SDB cases. METHODS: Here, we developed a fully automatic, data-driven algorithm that classifies apnea and hypopnea events based on the ECG using almost 10 000 polysomnographic sleep recordings from two large population-based samples, the Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS) and the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), which contain subjects with a broad range of sleep and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) to ensure heterogeneity. RESULTS: Performances on average were sensitivity(Se)=68.7%, precision (Pr)=69.1%, score (F1)=66.6% per subject, and accuracy of correctly classifying apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) severity score was Acc=84.9%. Target AHI and predicted AHI were highly correlated (R2 = 0.828) across subjects, indicating validity in predicting SDB severity. Our algorithm proved to be statistically robust between databases, between different periodic leg movement index (PLMI) severity groups, and for subjects with previous CVD incidents. Further, our algorithm achieved the state-of-the-art performance of Se=87.8%, Sp=91.1%, Acc=89.9% using independent comparisons and Se=90.7%, Sp=95.7%, Acc=93.8% using a transfer learning comparison on the apnea-ECG database. CONCLUSIONS: Our robust and automatic algorithm constitutes a minimally intrusive and inexpensive screening system for the detection of SDB events using the ECG to alleviate the current problems and costs associated with diagnosing SDB cases and to provide a system capable of identifying undiagnosed SDB cases.

N2  - Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a highly prevalent sleep disorder, which results in  daytime symptoms, a reduced quality of life as well as long-term negative health consequences. OSA diagnosis and severity rating is typically based on the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) retrieved from overnight poly(somno)graphy. However, polysomnography is costly, obtrusive and not suitable for long-term recordings. Here, we present a method for unobtrusive estimation of the AHI using ECG-based features to detect OSA-related events. Moreover, adding ECG-based sleep/wake scoring yields a fully automatic method for AHI-estimation. Importantly, our algorithm was developed and validated on a combination of clinical datasets, including datasets selectively including OSA-pathology but also a heterogeneous, "real-world" clinical sleep disordered population (262 participants in the validation set). The algorithm provides a good representation of the current gold standard AHI (0.72 correlation, estimation error of 0.56 ± 14.74 events/h), and can also be employed as a screening tool for a large range of OSA severities (ROC AUC ≥ 0.86, Cohen's kappa ≥ 0.53 and precision ≥70%). The method compares favourably to other OSA monitoring strategies, showing the feasibility of cardiovascular-based surrogates for sleep monitoring to evolve into clinically usable tools.

N2  - Background In patients with end-stage kidney disease, sudden cardiac death is more  frequent after a long interdialytic interval, within 6 hours after the end of a hemodialysis session. We hypothesized that the occurrence of paroxysmal arrhythmias is associated with changes in heart rate and heart rate variability in different phases of hemodialysis. Methods and Results We conducted a prospective ancillary study of the Predictors of Arrhythmic and Cardiovascular Risk in End Stage Renal Disease cohort. Continuous ECG monitoring was performed using an ECG patch, and short-term heart rate variability was measured for 3 minutes every hour (by root mean square of the successive normal-to-normal intervals, spectral analysis, Poincaré plot, and entropy), up to 300 hours. Out of enrolled participants (n=28; age 54±13 years; 57% men; 96% black; 33% with a history of cardiovascular disease; left ventricular ejection fraction 70±9%), arrhythmias were detected in 13 (46%). Nonsustained ventricular tachycardia occurred more frequently during/posthemodialysis than pre-/between hemodialysis (63% versus 37%, P=0.015). In adjusted for cardiovascular disease time-series analysis, nonsustained ventricular tachycardia was preceded by a sudden heart rate increase (by 11.2 [95% CI 10.1-12.3] beats per minute; P<0.0001). During every-other-day dialysis, root mean square of the successive normal-to-normal intervals had a significant circadian pattern (Mesor 10.6 [ 95% CI 0.9-11.2] ms; amplitude 1.5 [95% CI 1.0-3.1] ms; peak at 02:01 [95% CI 20:22-03:16] am; P<0.0001), which was replaced by a steady worsening on the second day without dialysis (root mean square of the successive normal-to-normal intervals -1.41 [95% CI -1.67 to -1.15] ms/24 h; P<0.0001). Conclusions Sudden increase in heart rate during/posthemodialysis is associated with nonsustained ventricular tachycardia. Every-other-day hemodialysis preserves circadian rhythm, but a second day without dialysis is characterized by parasympathetic withdrawal.

N2  - P wave and T wave in human-body electrocardiogram (ECG) signals often fuse together  when atrial premature contract (APC) occurs. P waves within the fused signals are valuable for the measurement of P wave parameters as well as diagnosis of supra-ventricular arrhythmias. However, the problem of extracting P wave from the fused signals is seldom addressed. In this study, a novel T wave cancellation method for P wave extraction based on maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation is proposed. In order to accurately cancel the T wave within the fused signal, T wave and the timing point of T wave peak are estimated simultaneously. The estimated timing point of T wave peak is used as alignment reference point for T wave subtraction. Simulation results show that the proposed method outperform the traditional T wave cancellation method in terms of both normalized mean square error and cross-correlation index. The results for real ECGs with APC demonstrate that the extracted P waves using the proposed method are more similar to the non-overlapping P waves in terms of morphology than the ones using the traditional T wave cancellation method.

N2  - The number of patients receiving pacemakers and defibrillators has grown  substantially over the last 20 years. In addition, the complexity and sophistication of these devices have increased, making diagnosis of pacemaker problems using the electrocardiogram (ECG) more difficult for clinicians in the emergency department. This article will focus on a few of the pitfalls to be avoided when interpreting paced ECGs. Pacemaker algorithms designed to minimize right ventricular pacing may be confused with pathologic failure to output. Automatic capture threshold detection schemes may be misinterpreted as failure to capture as well as undersensing due to the extra "backup" pacemaker spikes noted on rhythm strips. Device testing done in the emergency department may produce waveforms on monitor resembling ventricular tachycardia if pacemaker-mediated tachycardia is produced accidentally. Ventricular safety pacing algorithms may also be misinterpreted as failure to sense appropriately, triggering questions about pacemaker malfunction. Certain types of true undersensing may resemble morphologies consistent with pacemaker lead dislodgment. In addition, sophisticated programming features designed to mimic normal physiology could be misconstrued as pacemaker malfunction. These include pacemaker hysteresis and sleep mode. The presence of frequent premature ventricular complexes would cause a pacemaker to inhibit ventricular pacing appropriately. However, this could produce a palpated heart rate that is substantially lower than the programmed lower rate of the device due to reduced perfusion by the premature ventricular complexes, again raising questions about the appropriate functioning of the pacemaker. All of these situations will be discussed in detail along with approaches to systematically examining the paced ECGs to minimize the risk of misinterpretation. Pacemaker timing cycles as they relate to troubleshooting of the paced ECG will also be introduced.

N2  - Published scientific literature contains millions of figures, including information  about the results obtained from different scientific experiments e.g. PCR-ELISA data, microarray analysis, gel electrophoresis, mass spectrometry data, DNA/RNA sequencing, diagnostic imaging (CT/MRI and ultrasound scans), and medicinal imaging like electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG), echocardiography (ECG), positron-emission tomography (PET) images. The importance of biomedical figures has been widely recognized in scientific and medicine communities, as they play a vital role in providing major original data, experimental and computational results in concise form. One major challenge for implementing a system for scientific literature analysis is extracting and analyzing text and figures from published PDF files by physical and logical document analysis. Here we present a product line architecture based bioinformatics tool 'Mining Scientific Literature (MSL)', which supports the extraction of text and images by interpreting all kinds of published PDF files using advanced data mining and image processing techniques. It provides modules for the marginalization of extracted text based on different coordinates and keywords, visualization of extracted figures and extraction of embedded text from all kinds of biological and biomedical figures using applied Optimal Character Recognition (OCR). Moreover, for further analysis and usage, it generates the system's output in different formats including text, PDF, XML and images files. Hence, MSL is an easy to install and use analysis tool to interpret published scientific literature in PDF format.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to determine the frequency and nature of  errors made by computer electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis of atrial fibrillation (AF), and the clinical consequences. HYPOTHESIS: Computer software for interpreting ECGs has advanced. METHODS: A total of 10279 ECGs were collected, automatically interpreted by the built-in ECG software, and then reread by 2 cardiologists. AF-related ECGs were classified into 3 groups: overinterpreted AF (rhythms other than AF interpreted as AF), misinterpreted AF (AF interpreted as rhythms other than AF), and true AF (AF interpreted as AF by both computer ECG interpretation and cardiologists). RESULTS: There were 1057 AF-related ECGs from 409 patients. Among these, 840 ECGs (79.5%) were true AF. Overinterpretation occurred in 98 (9.3%) cases. Sinus rhythm and sinus tachycardia with premature atrial contraction and/or baseline artifact and sinus arrhythmia were commonly overinterpreted as AF. Heart rate ≤60 bpm and baseline artifact significantly increased the likelihood of overinterpreted AF. Misdiagnosis occurred in 119 (11.3%) cases, in which AF was usually misdiagnosed as sinus or supraventricular tachycardia. The presence of tachycardia and low-amplitude atrial activity significantly increased the likelihood of misdiagnosis of AF. Among the erroneous computer ECG interpretations, 17 cases (7.8%) were not corrected by the ordering physicians and/or repeat computer-ECG interpretation; inappropriate follow-up studies or treatments of the patients were undertaken with no serious sequelae. CONCLUSIONS: Erroneous computer ECG interpretation of AF was not rare. Attention should be concentrated on educating physicians about ECG appearance and confounding factors of AF, along with ongoing quality control of built-in software for automatic ECG interpretation.

N2  - BACKGROUND: In patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery (CABGS),  occurrence of atrial fibrillation (AF) is common in the postoperative period and is associated with increased morbidity with longer intensive unit care (ICU) and hospital stay. Prevention with antiarrhythmic drugs is of limited success and associated with significant side effects. Therefore alternative approaches, such as Bachmann Bundle pacing, are required. METHODS AND RESULTS: 154 consecutive patients, mean age 58±8.8 years, including 134 males and 20 females, were randomized to three groups; Group I : No pacing n= 54, Group II : RA pacing n= 52, Group III : Bachmann Bundle pacing n= 48. All the groups were well matched with regard to age, left atrial size, ejection fraction and use of beta blockers. Patients in Groups II and III were continually paced at a rate of 100 beats per minute (bpm) or at 10 bpm more than patients' intrinsic heart rate. All the patients were monitored for 72 hours by telemetry and occurrence of AF was noted. Incidence of AF was 0% (none of 48 patients) in Group III as compared to 16.6% in Group I (9 of 54 patients) (p 0.003) and 12.5% in Group II (5 of 52 patients) (p 0.03). There was a trend towards shorter ICU stay in Group III (3.9 days) as compared to Group II (4.5 days) and Group I (4.1 days). Among the three groups, the reduction in mean P wave duration also was greater in Bachmann bundle paced group. CONCLUSION: In patients undergoing CABGS, Bachmann bundle pacing is superior to right atrial / no pacing in the post operative period for preventing occurrence of AF and reducing ICU stay, commensurate with a reduction in mean P wave duration on surface ECG.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the value of pulse indicator continuous cardiac output  (PiCCO) monitoring in the treatment management of patients with severe heart failure. METHODS: Sixty patients of severe heart failure admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) of Fujian Provincial Hospital from August 2017 to February 2019 were enrolled, and they were divided into control group and treatment group according to random number table method, with 30 in each group. The treatment group used bedside PiCCO to carry out minimally invasive hemodynamics monitoring, according to the monitoring data target guidance for vasoactive drugs and liquid management. The control group was based only on traditional electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring and lung sound, urine volume of vasoactive drugs and liquid management. The changes of cardiac index (CI), global end diastolic volume index (GEDVI), extravascular lung water index (EVLWI), systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI), invasive mean arterial pressure (MAP) and central venous pressure (CVP) were observed before and 72 hours after treatment in the treatment group. The 7-day total effective rate, the length of ICU stay and 28-day mortality were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: Compared with before treatment, CI and MAP in the treatment group were significantly increased after treatment [CI (mL×s(-1)×m(-2)): 53.34±16.67 vs. 35.01±13.34, MAP (mmHg, 1 mmHg = 0.133 kPa): 72.6±10.6 vs. 62.5±10.3, both P < 0.05], GEDVI, EVLWI, SVRI, CVP were significantly decreased [GEDVI (mL/m(2)): 760.3±90.2 vs. 960.2±110.3, EVLWI (mL/kg): 6.5±1.3 vs. 12.5±6.2, SVRI (kPa×s×L(-1)×m(-2)): 297.3±35.1 vs. 434.1±58.8, CVP (mmHg): 10.1±2.6 vs. 12.2±3.4, all P < 0.05]. Compared with the control group, the 7-day total effective rate of the treatment group was significantly higher (90.0% vs. 80.0%), the length of ICU stay was significantly shorter (days: 8.2±4.5 vs. 10.3±2.5), and the 28-day mortality was significantly lower, with statistically significant difference (all P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: PiCCO monitoring is a goal-oriented treatment management for patients with severe heart failure, which is helpful to individualized accurate treatment, shorten the length of ICU stay and improve short-term prognosis.

N2  - © Journal of the Association of Physicians of India 2011. Objective: To classify shock, using ultrasonography as the modality of choice for imaging and to assess the diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound as a tool to classify shock. Design: Prospective study. Setting: KEM Hospital, Pune in the ICU (Intensive care unit). Study Population: 100 patients admitted to the ICU with undifferentiated shock. Methods: Bedside ultrasound examination was performed within 1 hour of admission to the ICU. These patients were also evaluated clinically and biochemically to confirm the type of shock. All patients immediately received standard diagnostic emergent interventions including physical examination, intravenous access for whole blood assays, arterial gas analysis, electrocardiography, continuous cardiac monitoring, supplemental oxygen and chest radiograph. Clinical parameters, urine output, ECG and biochemical tests were performed within 12 hours of USG. Additional investigations were performed wherever required. The ultrasonographic diagnoses were compared with the respective final clinical diagnoses by employing the Cohen kappa inter-rater coefficient of agreement. In addition, various ultrasound parameters were also analyzed to assess the best predictors for each type of shock. Results: The ultrasound diagnosis showed an overall good agreement (Cohen's kappa coefficient > or = 0.6) with the final clinical diagnosis, in identifying the type of shock, in the emergency setting, when ultrasound was done within 1 hour after admission to the ICU. In our study, ultrasound showed maximum sensitivity, specificity, negative and positive predictive values in the setting of obstructive shock. In addition, perfect agreement was seen between the ultrasound and clinical diagnosis, with a Cohen kappa coefficient of 1 in obstructive shock. The least sensitivity, specificity, negative and positive predictive values of ultrasound were seen in the setting of distributive shock. Least agreement between the ultrasound and clinical diagnosis was also seen in distributive shock, as most ultrasound findings were found to overlap with those in the other types of shock. (Cohen kappa coefficient of 0.6). Conclusion: Ultrasonography carried out within 1 hour of admission to the ICU plays a major role in correct diagnosis of the type of shock and subsequent patient management. The best ultrasonographic predictors for diagnosis of each type of shock, can help the clinician to start timely specific interventions in critical care settings for each type of shock.

N2  - P wave and T wave in human-body electrocardiogram (ECG) signals often fuse together  when atrial premature contract (APC) occurs. P waves within the fused signals are valuable for the measurement of P wave parameters as well as diagnosis of supra-ventricular arrhythmias. However, the problem of extracting P wave from the fused signals is seldom addressed. In this study, a novel T wave cancellation method for P wave extraction based on maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation is proposed. In order to accurately cancel the T wave within the fused signal, T wave and the timing point of T wave peak are estimated simultaneously. The estimated timing point of T wave peak is used as alignment reference point for T wave subtraction. Simulation results show that the proposed method outperform the traditional T wave cancellation method in terms of both normalized mean square error and cross-correlation index. The results for real ECGs with APC demonstrate that the extracted P waves using the proposed method are more similar to the non-overlapping P waves in terms of morphology than the ones using the traditional T wave cancellation method.

N2  - BACKGROUND: In patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery (CABGS),  occurrence of atrial fibrillation (AF) is common in the postoperative period and is associated with increased morbidity with longer intensive unit care (ICU) and hospital stay. Prevention with antiarrhythmic drugs is of limited success and associated with significant side effects. Therefore alternative approaches, such as Bachmann Bundle pacing, are required. METHODS AND RESULTS: 154 consecutive patients, mean age 58±8.8 years, including 134 males and 20 females, were randomized to three groups; Group I : No pacing n= 54, Group II : RA pacing n= 52, Group III : Bachmann Bundle pacing n= 48. All the groups were well matched with regard to age, left atrial size, ejection fraction and use of beta blockers. Patients in Groups II and III were continually paced at a rate of 100 beats per minute (bpm) or at 10 bpm more than patients' intrinsic heart rate. All the patients were monitored for 72 hours by telemetry and occurrence of AF was noted. Incidence of AF was 0% (none of 48 patients) in Group III as compared to 16.6% in Group I (9 of 54 patients) (p 0.003) and 12.5% in Group II (5 of 52 patients) (p 0.03). There was a trend towards shorter ICU stay in Group III (3.9 days) as compared to Group II (4.5 days) and Group I (4.1 days). Among the three groups, the reduction in mean P wave duration also was greater in Bachmann bundle paced group. CONCLUSION: In patients undergoing CABGS, Bachmann bundle pacing is superior to right atrial / no pacing in the post operative period for preventing occurrence of AF and reducing ICU stay, commensurate with a reduction in mean P wave duration on surface ECG.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: We examined 500 athletes aged 9-18 (mean 16.1 ± 2.2) years members of national teams of 27 kinds of sport. There were 333 females with mean age 16.0 ± 1.01 years and 167 males with mean age 16.3 ± 1.4. All athletes underwent ECG registration in clino- and ortho- positions and bicycle ET with automatic analysis of MTAT-wave alternans. RESULTS: Mean MTA value was 26 ± 13 (9-51) mV. MTA above 65 mV was registered in 10 persons (2.1%) 5 of whom had signs of overtraining. Sensitivity (Se) of MTA for detection of overtraining state was 21%, specificity (Sp)--99%, positive and negative predictive value--50 and 96%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Normal MTA range during ET is 9-51 mV. MTA values during ET do not depend on age and sex but are determined by duration of participation in sports and myocardial mass. MTA value is related to length of QT-interval. Increase of maximal MTA values above 65 mV is insensitive (Se 21%) but highly specific (Sp 99%) sign of overtraining in adolescent elite athletes.

N2  - The number of patients receiving pacemakers and defibrillators has grown  substantially over the last 20 years. In addition, the complexity and sophistication of these devices have increased, making diagnosis of pacemaker problems using the electrocardiogram (ECG) more difficult for clinicians in the emergency department. This article will focus on a few of the pitfalls to be avoided when interpreting paced ECGs. Pacemaker algorithms designed to minimize right ventricular pacing may be confused with pathologic failure to output. Automatic capture threshold detection schemes may be misinterpreted as failure to capture as well as undersensing due to the extra "backup" pacemaker spikes noted on rhythm strips. Device testing done in the emergency department may produce waveforms on monitor resembling ventricular tachycardia if pacemaker-mediated tachycardia is produced accidentally. Ventricular safety pacing algorithms may also be misinterpreted as failure to sense appropriately, triggering questions about pacemaker malfunction. Certain types of true undersensing may resemble morphologies consistent with pacemaker lead dislodgment. In addition, sophisticated programming features designed to mimic normal physiology could be misconstrued as pacemaker malfunction. These include pacemaker hysteresis and sleep mode. The presence of frequent premature ventricular complexes would cause a pacemaker to inhibit ventricular pacing appropriately. However, this could produce a palpated heart rate that is substantially lower than the programmed lower rate of the device due to reduced perfusion by the premature ventricular complexes, again raising questions about the appropriate functioning of the pacemaker. All of these situations will be discussed in detail along with approaches to systematically examining the paced ECGs to minimize the risk of misinterpretation. Pacemaker timing cycles as they relate to troubleshooting of the paced ECG will also be introduced.

The importance of biomedical figures has been widely recognized in scientific and medicine communities, as they play a vital role in providing major original data, experimental and computational results in concise form. One major challenge for implementing a system for scientific literature analysis is extracting and analyzing text and figures from published PDF files by physical and logical document analysis. Here we present a product line architecture based bioinformatics tool 'Mining Scientific Literature (MSL)', which supports the extraction of text and images by interpreting all kinds of published PDF files using advanced data mining and image processing techniques. It provides modules for the marginalization of extracted text based on different coordinates and keywords, visualization of extracted figures and extraction of embedded text from all kinds of biological and biomedical figures using applied Optimal Character Recognition (OCR). Moreover, for further analysis and usage, it generates the system's output in different formats including text, PDF, XML and images files. Hence, MSL is an easy to install and use analysis tool to interpret published scientific literature in PDF format.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to determine the frequency and nature of errors made by computer electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis of atrial fibrillation (AF), and the clinical consequences. HYPOTHESIS: Computer software for interpreting ECGs has advanced. METHODS: A total of 10279 ECGs were collected, automatically interpreted by the built-in ECG software, and then reread by 2 cardiologists. AF-related ECGs were classified into 3 groups: overinterpreted AF (rhythms other than AF interpreted as AF), misinterpreted AF (AF interpreted as rhythms other than AF), and true AF (AF interpreted as AF by both computer ECG interpretation and cardiologists). RESULTS: There were 1057 AF-related ECGs from 409 patients. Among these, 840 ECGs (79.5%) were true AF. Overinterpretation occurred in 98 (9.3%) cases. Sinus rhythm and sinus tachycardia with premature atrial contraction and/or baseline artifact and sinus arrhythmia were commonly overinterpreted as AF. Heart rate ≤60 bpm and baseline artifact significantly increased the likelihood of overinterpreted AF. Misdiagnosis occurred in 119 (11.3%) cases, in which AF was usually misdiagnosed as sinus or supraventricular tachycardia. The presence of tachycardia and low-amplitude atrial activity significantly increased the likelihood of misdiagnosis of AF. Among the erroneous computer ECG interpretations, 17 cases (7.8%) were not corrected by the ordering physicians and/or repeat computer-ECG interpretation; inappropriate follow-up studies or treatments of the patients were undertaken with no serious sequelae. CONCLUSIONS: Erroneous computer ECG interpretation of AF was not rare. Attention should be concentrated on educating physicians about ECG appearance and confounding factors of AF, along with ongoing quality control of built-in software for automatic ECG interpretation.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the value of pulse indicator continuous cardiac output  (PiCCO) monitoring in the treatment management of patients with severe heart failure. METHODS: Sixty patients of severe heart failure admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) of Fujian Provincial Hospital from August 2017 to February 2019 were enrolled, and they were divided into control group and treatment group according to random number table method, with 30 in each group. The treatment group used bedside PiCCO to carry out minimally invasive hemodynamics monitoring, according to the monitoring data target guidance for vasoactive drugs and liquid management. The control group was based only on traditional electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring and lung sound, urine volume of vasoactive drugs and liquid management. The changes of cardiac index (CI), global end diastolic volume index (GEDVI), extravascular lung water index (EVLWI), systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI), invasive mean arterial pressure (MAP) and central venous pressure (CVP) were observed before and 72 hours after treatment in the treatment group. The 7-day total effective rate, the length of ICU stay and 28-day mortality were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: Compared with before treatment, CI and MAP in the treatment group were significantly increased after treatment [CI (mL×s(-1)×m(-2)): 53.34±16.67 vs. 35.01±13.34, MAP (mmHg, 1 mmHg = 0.133 kPa): 72.6±10.6 vs. 62.5±10.3, both P < 0.05], GEDVI, EVLWI, SVRI, CVP were significantly decreased [GEDVI (mL/m(2)): 760.3±90.2 vs. 960.2±110.3, EVLWI (mL/kg): 6.5±1.3 vs. 12.5±6.2, SVRI (kPa×s×L(-1)×m(-2)): 297.3±35.1 vs. 434.1±58.8, CVP (mmHg): 10.1±2.6 vs. 12.2±3.4, all P < 0.05]. Compared with the control group, the 7-day total effective rate of the treatment group was significantly higher (90.0% vs. 80.0%), the length of ICU stay was significantly shorter (days: 8.2±4.5 vs. 10.3±2.5), and the 28-day mortality was significantly lower, with statistically significant difference (all P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: PiCCO monitoring is a goal-oriented treatment management for patients with severe heart failure, which is helpful to individualized accurate treatment, shorten the length of ICU stay and improve short-term prognosis.
