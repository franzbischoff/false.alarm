The tsmp package is a toolkit that allows all-pairs similarity joins, motif, discords and chains discovery, semantic segmentation, etc. Here we describe how the tsmp package may be used by showing some of the use-cases from the original articles and evaluate the algorithm speed in the R environment.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE To determine the predictive value of patient monitoring alarms as a warning system in a pediatric intensive care unit (ICU). DESIGN Prospective, observational study. SETTING Pediatric ICU of a university affiliated children's hospital. INTERVENTIONS During a 7-day period, ICU staff were asked to record the type and number of alarm soundings. Alarms were recorded as false, significant (resulted in change in therapy), or induced (by staff manipulations; not significant). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Sixty-six percent of nursing shifts (928 patient hours of care) responded. There were 2,176 alarms soundings: 1,481 (68{\%}) false, 119 (5.5{\%}) significant, and 576 (26.5{\%}) induced. Alarm origins were: 44{\%} pulse oximeter, 1{\%} end-tidal PCO2, 31{\%} ventilator, and 24{\%} electrocardiograph (EKG). The positive predictive value of alarms were: 7{\%} pulse oximeter, 16{\%} end-tidal PCO2, 3{\%} ventilator, and 5{\%} EKG. The negative predictive value of all alarms were {\textgreater} 97{\%}. More alarms sounded during the 7:00 am to 3:00 pm shift than during the 3:00 pm to 11:00 pm or 11:00 pm to 7:00 am shifts (167 +/- 19 vs. 64 +/- 39 vs. 75 +/- 43, p {\textless} .05, respectively). When corrected for number of patients/shift, the occurrence of soundings differed only between day and night (11.4 +/- 1.5/patient/shift vs. 6.1 +/- 1.0, p {\textless} .05). CONCLUSIONS Over 94{\%} of alarm soundings in a pediatric ICU may not be clinically important. Present monitoring systems are poor predictors of untoward events.},

abstract = {High false alarm rates in the ICU decrease quality of care by slowing staff response times while increasing patient delirium through noise pollution. The 2015 Physio-Net/Computing in Cardiology Challenge provides a set of 1,250 multi-parameter ICU data segments associated with critical arrhythmia alarms, and challenges the general research community to address the issue of false alarm suppression using all available signals. Each data segment was 5 minutes long (for real time analysis), ending at the time of the alarm. For retrospective analysis, we provided a further 30 seconds of data after the alarm was triggered. A collection of 750 data segments was made available for training and a set of 500 was held back for testing. Each alarm was reviewed by expert annotators, at least two of whom agreed that the alarm was either true or false. Challenge participants were invited to submit a complete, working algorithm to distinguish true from false alarms, and received a score based on their program's performance on the hidden test set. This score was based on the percentage of alarms correct, but with a penalty that weights the suppression of true alarms five times more heavily than acceptance of false alarms. We provided three example entries based on well-known, open source signal processing algorithms, to serve as a basis for comparison and as a starting point for participants to develop their own code. A total of 38 teams submitted a total of 215 entries in this year's Challenge.},

@article{VanBenschoten2020,
abstract = {We propose to meta-learn causal structures based on how fast a learner adapts to new distributions arising from sparse distributional changes, e.g. due to interventions, actions of agents and other sources of non-stationarities. We show that under this assumption, the correct causal structural choices lead to faster adaptation to modified distributions because the changes are concentrated in one or just a few mechanisms when the learned knowledge is modularized appropriately. This leads to sparse expected gradients and a lower effective number of degrees of freedom needing to be relearned while adapting to the change. It motivates using the speed of adaptation to a modified distribution as a meta-learning objective. We demonstrate how this can be used to determine the cause-effect relationship between two observed variables. The distributional changes do not need to correspond to standard interventions (clamping a variable), and the learner has no direct knowledge of these interventions. We show that causal structures can be parameterized via continuous variables and learned end-to-end. We then explore how these ideas could be used to also learn an encoder that would map low-level observed variables to unobserved causal variables leading to faster adaptation out-of-distribution, learning a representation space where one can satisfy the assumptions of independent mechanisms and of small and sparse changes in these mechanisms due to actions and non-stationarities.},
