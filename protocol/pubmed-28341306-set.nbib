AB  - OBJECTIVES: High frequency QRS (HFQRS) analysis has been shown to be an accurate 
      marker for myocardial ischemia. Our objective was to test the use of HFQRS in 
      diagnosing ACS in the emergency department. METHODS: 324 patients presenting to the 
      ED with chest pain were enrolled. Resting ECG was recorded and later analyzed by an 
      HFQRS algorithm. Results were compared to the conventional ECG diagnosis by 3 
      independent interpretations: treating physician, expert cardiologist and an 
      automated computer program. RESULTS: The HFQRS analysis demonstrated improved 
      sensitivity (67.5%) for the NSTE-ACS group compared to the human interpreters (59.7% 
      and 53.2% for the treating physician and cardiologist respectively) with similar 
      specificity. The automatic program had significantly lower sensitivity (31%) with a 
      higher specificity (77%). CONCLUSIONS: HFQRS which has shown great promise in 
      diagnosing stable CAD may also be helpful in the ED for diagnosing ACS.

AB  - A previously asymptomatic young female with no previous medical or cardiac history 
      collapsed during indoor exercise. A portable automatic external defibrillator showed 
      a shockable rhythm. She received multiple electrical shocks with return to normal 
      sinus rhythm without ischaemic ECG changes. Her troponin level was mildly elevated. 
      A transthoracic echocardiogram revealed moderately reduced left ventricular ejection 
      fraction with global hypokinesis. During emergent coronary angiography, the left 
      main coronary artery could not be found. The right coronary artery was normal with 
      robust collaterals to the entire left coronary circulation extending to the left 
      main coronary artery, but did not fill the ostium. Coronary CT angiogram confirmed 
      nearly complete absence of the left main coronary artery ostium. A diagnosis of left 
      main coronary artery atresia was made. Patient underwent successful two vessel 
      coronary artery bypass grafting. She continues to do well 1 year postoperatively.

TI  - A multi-feature based morphological algorithm for ST shape classification.
PG  - 5834-7
LID - 10.1109/EMBC.2015.7319718 [doi]
AB  - Abnormal ST segment is an important parameter for the diagnosis of myocardial 
      ischemia and other heart diseases. As most abnormal ST segments sustain for only a 
      few seconds, it is impractical for the doctors to detect and classify abnormal ones 
      manually on time. Even though many ST segment classification algorithms are proposed 
      to meet the rising demand of automatic myocardial ischemia diagnosis, they are often 
      with lower recognition rate. The aim of this study is to detect abnormal ST segments 
      precisely and classify them into more categories, and thus provide more detailed 
      category information to help the clinicians make decisions. This study sums up ten 
      common abnormal ST segments according to the clinical ECG records and proposes a 
      morphological classification algorithm of ST segment based on multi-features. This 
      algorithm consists of two parts: Feature points extraction and ST segment 
      classification. In the first part, R wave is detected by using the 2B-spline wavelet 
      transform, and mode-filtering method and morphological characteristics are used for 
      other feature points extraction. In the ST segment classification process, ST 
      segment level, variance, slope value, number of convex/concave points and other 
      feature parameters are employed to classify the ST segment. This algorithm can 
      classify abnormal ST segments into ten categories above. We evaluated the 
      performance of the proposed algorithm based on ECG data in the European ST-T 
      database. The global recognition rate of 92.7% and the best accuracy of 97% 
      demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed solution.

AB  - The heart muscle pumps blood to vital organs, which is indispensable for human life. 
      Congestive heart failure (CHF) is characterized by the inability of the heart to 
      pump blood adequately throughout the body without an increase in intracardiac 
      pressure. The symptoms include lung and peripheral congestion, leading to breathing 
      difficulty and swollen limbs, dizziness from reduced delivery of blood to the brain, 
      as well as arrhythmia. Coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, and medical 
      co-morbidities such as kidney disease, diabetes, and high blood pressure all take a 
      toll on the heart and can impair myocardial function. CHF prevalence is growing 
      worldwide. It afflicts millions of people globally, and is a leading cause of death. 
      Hence, proper diagnosis, monitoring and management are imperative. The importance of 
      an objective CHF diagnostic tool cannot be overemphasized. Standard diagnostic tests 
      for CHF include chest X-ray, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), nuclear imaging, 
      echocardiography, and invasive angiography. However, these methods are costly, 
      time-consuming, and they can be operator-dependent. Electrocardiography (ECG) is 
      inexpensive and widely accessible, but ECG changes are typically not specific for 
      CHF diagnosis. A properly designed computer-aided detection (CAD) system for CHF, 
      based on the ECG, would potentially reduce subjectivity and provide quantitative 
      assessment for informed decision-making. Herein, we review existing CAD for 
      automatic CHF diagnosis, and highlight the development of an ECG-based CAD 
      diagnostic system that employs deep learning algorithms to automatically detect CHF.

TI  - Drug-induced long QT syndrome and fatal arrhythmias in the intensive care unit.
PG  - 266-72
LID - 10.1111/aas.12257 [doi]
AB  - Long QT syndrome (LQTS) is a genetic or acquired condition characterised by a 
      prolonged QT interval on the surface electrocardiogram (ECG) and is associated with 
      a high risk of sudden cardiac death because of polymorph ventricular tachyarrhythmia 
      called Torsade de Pointes arrhythmia. Drug-induced LQTS can occur as a side effect 
      of commonly used cardiac and non-cardiac drugs in predisposed patients, often with 
      baseline QT prolongation lengthened by medication and/or electrolyte disturbances. 
      Hospitalised patients often have several risk factors for proarrhythmic response, 
      such as advanced age and structural heart disease. Patients in the intensive care 
      unit (ICU) are particularly prone to develop drug induced LQTS because they receive 
      several different intravenous medications. Additionally, they might have impaired 
      drug elimination because of reduced kidney and/or liver function, and also 
      drug-drug-interactions. The clinical symptoms and signs of LQTS range from 
      asymptomatic patients to sudden death because of malignant arrhythmias, and it is 
      therefore important to recognise the clinical characteristics and typical ECG 
      changes. Treatment of acquired LQTS is mainly awareness, identification and 
      discontinuation of QT prolonging drugs, in addition to eventually supplement of 
      magnesium and potassium. Overdrive cardiac pacing is highly effective in preventing 
      recurrences, and antiarrhythmic drugs should be avoided. Recent data suggest that QT 
      prolongation is quite common in ICU patients and adversely affects patient 
      mortality. Thus, high-risk patients should be sufficiently monitored, and the use of 
      medications known to cause drug-induced LQTS might have to be restricted.

LID - 307168
AB  - The Transvalvular Impedance (TVI) is derived between atrial and ventricular pacing 
      electrodes. A sharp TVI increase in systole is an ejection marker, allowing the 
      hemodynamic surveillance of ventricular stimulation effectiveness in pacemaker 
      patients. At routine follow-up checks, the ventricular threshold test was managed by 
      the stimulator with the supervision of a physician, who monitored the surface ECG. 
      When the energy scan resulted in capture loss, the TVI system must detect the 
      failure and increase the output voltage. A TVI signal suitable to this purpose was 
      present in 85% of the tested patients. A total of 230 capture failures, induced in 
      115 patients in both supine and sitting upright positions, were all promptly 
      recognized by real-time TVI analysis (100% sensitivity). The procedure was never 
      interrupted by the physician, as the automatic energy regulation ensured full 
      patient's safety. The pulse energy was then set at 4 times the threshold to test the 
      alarm specificity during daily activity (sitting, standing up, and walking). The 
      median prevalence of false alarms was 0.336%. The study shows that TVI-based 
      ejection assessment is a valuable approach to the verification of pacing reliability 
      and the autoregulation of ventricular stimulation energy.

TI  - Predictors of aging based on the analysis of heart rate variability.
PG  - 1269-1278

AB  - BACKGROUND: The current significant progress in the use of heart rate variability in 
      the solution of many diagnostic and therapeutic problems is determined by the 
      availability of standardized methods of measurement and physiological interpretation 
      of heart rate variability indices on the one hand and the high technological level 
      of state-of-the-art electronic measuring equipment that is used for automatic 
      registration and computer processing of cardio-signals. METHODS: A retrospective 
      analysis of anonymized cardio screening results of 22,433 adult residents of 565 
      settlements (cities and villages) across all 20 administrative districts of the 
      Khmelnytskyi Region (Ukraine) was conducted to find a statistically significant 
      connection between individual heart rate variability parameters and the age of 
      people. RESULTS: Primary statistical analysis and visualization showed a correlation 
      between the selected heart rate variability parameters and the age and sex of the 
      examined persons. The study found values of the predicted age slightly over 
      estimation versus the actual age for very young test subjects and below estimation 
      for elderly subjects. CONCLUSION: The use of neural network computations and the 
      modification of the algorithm through the construction of individual training 
      samples for different age intervals, and the creation of individual ensembles of 
      classification neural networks, therefore achieved a prediction of the age of 
      examined persons based on the values of their time and frequency domain heart rate 
      variability indices, with 87% accuracy for women and 85% accuracy for men in the 
      66-85 years age interval and at least 85% for age groups across the entire sample.

TI  - A phase I, dose-escalation trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of emulsified 
      isoflurane in healthy human volunteers.
PG  - 614-25
LID - 10.1097/ALN.0000000000000044 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: This first-in-human volunteer phase I clinical trial aimed to evaluate 
      the safety, tolerability, and anesthesia efficacy of emulsified isoflurane (EI), an 
      intravenously injectable formulation of isoflurane. METHODS: Seventy-eight healthy 
      volunteers were recruited in this open-label, single-bolus, dose-escalation, phase I 
      trial and were allocated into 16 cohorts. Each volunteer received a single bolus 
      injection of EI. The dose started with 0.3 mg/kg (for isoflurane) and was planned to 
      end with 64.6 mg/kg. Postdose vital signs, physical examination, laboratory tests, 
      chest radiograph, 12-lead electrocardiogram, and development of any adverse event 
      were closely monitored as safety measurements. Effectiveness in producing 
      sedation/anesthesia was assessed by Modified Observer's Assessment of 
      Alertness/Sedation and Bispectral Index. RESULTS: The dose escalation ended as 
      planned. The most common adverse events associated with EI were injection pain (77 
      of 78, 98.7%) and transient tachycardia (22 of 78, 25.6%). Only at high doses (≥38.3 
      mg/kg) did EI cause transient hypotension (5 of 78, 6.4%) or apnea (11 of 78, 
      14.1%), but all the affected volunteers recovered uneventfully. Fast onset of 
      unconsciousness (typically 40 s after injection) was developed in all volunteers 
      receiving doses of 22.6 mg/kg or greater. Waking-up time and depression in Modified 
      Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation correlated well with EI dose. None of 
      the postdose tests revealed any abnormal result. CONCLUSIONS: EI is safe for 
      intravenous injection in human volunteers in the dose range of 0.3 to 64.6 mg/kg. At 
      doses of 22.6 mg/kg or higher, EI produced rapid onset of unconsciousness in all 
      volunteers followed by fast, predictable, and complete recovery.

TI  - Chaos-Based Analysis of Heart Rate Variability Time Series in Obstructive Sleep 
      Apnea Subjects.
PG  - 53-59
LID - 10.4103/jmss.JMSS_23_19 [doi]
AB  - Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common disorder which can cause periodic 
      fluctuations in heart rate. To diagnose sleep apnea, some studies analyze 
      electrocardiogram (ECG) signals by adopting chaos-based analysis. This research is 
      going to specifically focus on whether it is possible to use chaos-based analysis of 
      heart rate variability (HRV) signals rather than using chaotic analysis of ECG 
      signals to diagnose OSA. While conventional studies mostly use chaos-based analysis 
      of ECG signals to detect OSA, here, we apply correlation dimension (CD) as a chaotic 
      index to analyze HRV data in OSA patients. For this purpose, 17 patients with OSA 
      and 9 healthy individuals referred to a sleep clinic in Isfahan/Iran are studied, 
      and their HRV time series were extracted from 1-h ECG signals recorded overnight. 
      The preliminary step to calculate CD is phase-space reconstruction of the system 
      based on HRV time series. Corresponding parameters, including embedding dimension 
      and lag time, are estimated optimally using enhanced related methods, and then CD is 
      calculated using Grassberger-Procaccia algorithm. Moreover, to evaluate our results, 
      detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA), one of the well-known nonlinear methods in HRV 
      analysis to detect OSA, is also applied to our data and the result is compared with 
      those obtained from CD analysis of HRV. CD index with P < 0.005 indicates a 
      significant difference in nonlinear dynamics of HRV signals detected from OSA 
      patients and healthy individuals.

TI  - Association between cardiac troponin I concentrations and electrocardiographic 
      abnormalities in dogs with blunt trauma.
PG  - 179-186
LID - 10.1111/vec.12933 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a normal cardiac troponin I (cTnI) concentration and 
      normal ECG on entry rule out the development of a clinically significant cardiac 
      arrhythmia (CSCA, defined as an arrhythmia requiring anti-arrhythmic treatment) in 
      dogs that have sustained blunt trauma. DESIGN: Prospective, observational study. 
      Client-owned dogs were enrolled between January 2015 and November 2016. SETTING: 
      University teaching hospital. ANIMALS: Forty-seven client-owned dogs with a history 
      of witnessed or suspected blunt trauma within 24 hours prior to presentation to the 
      hospital. INTERVENTIONS: On admission to the emergency service, dogs had a standard 
      3-lead ECG and cTnI concentration (using a veterinary point-of-care device(*) ) 
      performed. Animal Trauma Triage (ATT) scores, Modified Glasgow Coma Scale (MGCS), 
      and the details regarding the nature and timing of the injury were recorded. The 
      patients were monitored in the ICU for a minimum of 24 hours on continuous ECG 
      telemetry. Cardiac rhythm was monitored every hour, and any abnormalities were 
      noted. The need for anti-arrhythmic therapy was recorded. There were no treatment 
      interventions. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Five of 47 dogs (10.6%) developed a 
      CSCA during hospitalization after sustaining blunt trauma. A normal entry ECG and 
      normal cardiac troponin concentration on entry had a 100% negative predictive value 
      (NPV) for ruling out the development of a CSCA, although a normal cardiac troponin 
      concentration alone also had an NPV of 100%. A normal entry ECG had an NPV of 95.3%. 
      The prognosis for survival to discharge was 89.4% in this study population (42/47 
      dogs). CONCLUSIONS: In dogs with blunt trauma, an entry cTnI concentration or a 
      combination of cTnI and ECG on entry may be useful in determining which patients are 
      at a higher risk for the development of CSCA during the first 12 to 24 hours after 
      the trauma.

      Activity.
PG  - 1090-1093
LID - 10.1109/EMBC.2018.8512492 [doi]
AB  - Hot flashes (HF) are intense, transient feelings of heat usually accompanied with 
      flushed skin and sweating that are experienced by women around the time of 
      menopause. HFs are associated with poor quality of life and increased cardiovascular 
      risk. Automatic detection of HF occurrence and precise timing of HF onset could 
      provide unique insight into the physiology of the HF and its effect on the 
      cardiovascular system. A novel automatic algorithm is proposed for the detection of 
      HFs occurrence and timing from the sternal skin conductance signal that is robust to 
      noise and artifacts. The method is based on the gold standard rule (2μS rise in skin 
      conductance within 30 s) and considers several conditions based on the skin 
      conductance level and its derivative to reject unwanted events. ECG-derived heart 
      rate pattern variations are studied prior to the detected HF onset. The algorithm is 
      validated against expert detected HFs over 200 hours of sleep data collected from 12 
      perimenopausal women. It achieved a total accuracy of 93% and a total error of 3% in 
      HF detection. It was observed that heart rate increased before the onset of 80% of 
      the HFs occurring in undisturbed sleep. Application of this algorithm along with 
      fusion of other simultaneously recorded physiological measures has the potential to 
      advance understanding of the HF.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Autonomic dysfunctions occur during but also in between seizures. During 
      seizures, the direct involvement of central autonomic control centers cause specific 
      changes in heart rate and respiration. The pathophysiology of autonomic dysfunctions 
      that are observed in the interictal period is more difficult to explain. These 
      alterations are most likely due to changes in the epileptic network and/or to a 
      lesser extent due to direct interictal spike activity disturbing central autonomic 
      centers. The aim of our study is to investigate whether ictal and interictal 
      respiratory changes do occur in temporal lobe and absence epilepsy in children. We 
      hypothesize that the interictal autonomic changes are due to changes in the neuronal 
      network, by studying epilepsy patients with normal interictal background EEG. 
      METHODS: Ictal and interictal single-lead ECG signals were extracted from 24h 
      video-EEG recordings in 10 children with refractory temporal lobe seizures, in 10 
      children with absence seizures with occasional interictal discharges and 10 control 
      subjects. RR interval time series were calculated and respiration parameters were 
      derived from the ECG signal. ECG-derived respiration (EDR) signals were computed and 
      time and frequency domain parameters were extracted to characterize the respiratory 
      function. RESULTS: In the ictal registrations we observed bradypnea in 10 out of the 
      12 recorded seizures from the temporal lobe. In absence seizures, we observed a 
      variable ictal effect on respiratory rate. In the analysis of the interictal data, 
      the most remarkable finding was the higher power in the low frequency band and lower 
      power in the high frequency band of the EDR signals in patients with absence 
      seizures compared to control subjects, indicating a shift of respiratory rate to the 
      lower frequencies. CONCLUSION: In conclusion we found a uniform pattern in ictal 
      respiratory changes in temporal lobe seizures, due to direct involvement of central 
      respiratory centers. In absence epilepsy, we found a disturbed respiratory control 
      in between seizures. These changes were not present in the patients with temporal 
      lobe epilepsy. The observed interictal changes in respiration in absence epilepsy 
      are most likely due to epileptogenetic changes in the thalamocortical network, 
      involved in absence epilepsy and could not be explained by interictal spike 
      activity.

AB  - An important tool in early diagnosis of cardiac dysfunctions is the analysis of 
      electrocardiograms (ECGs) obtained from ambulatory long-term recordings. Heart rate 
      variability (HRV) analysis became a significant tool for assessing the cardiac 
      health. The usefulness of HRV assessment for the prediction of cardiovascular events 
      in end-stage renal disease patients was previously reported. The aim of this work is 
      to verify an enhanced algorithm to obtain an RR-interval time series in a fully 
      automated manner. The multi-lead corrected R-peaks of each ECG lead are used for 
      RR-series computation and the algorithm is verified by a comparison with manually 
      reviewed reference RR-time series. Twenty-four hour 12-lead ECG recordings of 339 
      end-stage renal disease patients from the ISAR (rISk strAtification in end-stage 
      Renal disease) study were used. Seven universal indicators were calculated to allow 
      for a generalization of the comparison results. The median score of the indicator of 
      synchronization, i.e. intraclass correlation coefficient, was 96.4% and the median 
      of the root mean square error of the difference time series was 7.5 ms. The 
      negligible error and high synchronization rate indicate high similarity and verified 
      the agreement between the fully automated RR-interval series calculated with the AIT 
      Multi-Lead ECGsolver and the reference time series. As a future perspective, HRV 
      parameters calculated on this RR-time series can be evaluated in longitudinal 
      studies to ensure clinical benefit.

      Variational Mode Decomposition.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Ambulatory based healthcare system use limited electrodes 
      for electroencephalogram (EEG) acquisition at concerned electrode position, to 
      minimize the instrumentation and computational complexity. But, again the 
      possibility of contamination is inevitable depending on the electrode position on 
      the scalp. This paper proposes an electrocardiogram (ECG) artifact correction 
      algorithm in the absence of coherent ECG for automatic analysis/diagnosis of the 
      acquired contaminated single channel EEG signal. METHODS: The proposed algorithm 
      uses an enhanced and modified version of signal decomposition i.e. modified 
      variational mode decomposition (mVMD) to obtain band limited intrinsic mode 
      functions (BLIMFs) from EEG epoch. The mVMD is found to be useful when the signal 
      contains properties that are correlated. Further, exploiting the correlation among 
      the obtained mode functions the ECG artifact components are identified. An ECG 
      reference is estimated and QRS complexes are suppressed. The effective EEG 
      reconstruction is performed by simply adding the remaining BLIMFs to QRS complex 
      suppressed estimated reference. This is owing to the robust reconstruction feature 
      provided by mVMD. RESULTS: Upon the comparative evaluation for both real and 
      semi-simulated dataset, the proposed algorithm is providing less distortion to the 
      EEG brain activity frequency bands, and is also less computationally intensive than 
      the existing Ensembled empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) based algorithm that 
      requires ECG reference channel. Evaluation of semi-simulated dataset obtained an 
      average correlation of 97% between EEG signals before contamination and after 
      correction of ECG artifact. CONCLUSION: The proposed algorithm efficiently corrects 
      the ECG artifact from EEG while overcoming the limitations such as, (1) requirement 
      of a reference ECG channel, (2) requirement of R-R interval or amplitude 
      thresholding for QRS complex identification.

TI  - Non-Standardized Patch-Based ECG Lead Together With Deep Learning Based Algorithm 
      for Automatic Screening of Atrial Fibrillation.
PG  - 1569-1578
LID - 10.1109/JBHI.2020.2980454 [doi]
AB  - This study was to assess the feasibility of using non-standardized single-lead 
      electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring to automatically detect atrial fibrillation (AF) 
      with special emphasis on the combination of deep learning based algorithm and 
      modified patch-based ECG lead. Fifty-five consecutive patients were monitored for AF 
      in around 24 hours by patch-based ECG devices along with a standard 12-lead Holter. 
      Catering to potential positional variability of patch lead, four typical positions 
      on the upper-left chest were proposed. For each patch lead, the performance of 
      automated algorithms with four different convolutional neural networks (CNN) was 
      evaluated for AF detection against blinded annotations of two clinicians. A total of 
      349,388 10-second segments of AF and 161,084 segments of sinus rhythm were detected 
      successfully. Good agreement between patch-based single-lead and standard 12-lead 
      recordings was obtained at the position MP1 that corresponds to modified lead II, 
      and a promising performance of the automated algorithm with an R-R intervals based 
      CNN model was achieved on this lead in terms of accuracy (93.1%), sensitivity 
      (93.1%), and specificity (93.4%). The present results suggest that the optimized 
      patch-based ECG lead along by deep learning based algorithms may offer the 
      possibility of providing an accurate, easy, and inexpensive clinical tool for mass 
      screening of AF.

TI  - Predictive monitoring for early detection of sepsis in neonatal ICU patients.
PG  - 172-9
LID - 10.1097/MOP.0b013e32835e8fe6 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Predictive monitoring is an exciting new field involving analysis 
      of physiologic data to detect abnormal patterns associated with critical illness. 
      The first example of predictive monitoring being taken from inception (proof of 
      concept) to reality (demonstration of improved outcomes) is the use of heart rate 
      characteristics (HRC) monitoring to detect sepsis in infants in the neonatal ICU. 
      The commercially available 'HeRO' monitor analyzes electrocardiogram data from 
      existing bedside monitors for decreased HR variability and transient decelerations 
      associated with sepsis, and converts these changes into a score (the HRC index or 
      HeRO score). This score is the fold increase in probability that a patient will have 
      a clinical deterioration from sepsis within 24 h. This review focuses on HRC 
      monitoring and discusses future directions in predictive monitoring of ICU patients. 
      RECENT FINDINGS: In a randomized trial of 3003 very low birthweight infants, display 
      of the HeRO score reduced mortality more than 20%. Ongoing research aims to combine 
      respiratory and HR analysis to optimize care of ICU patients. SUMMARY: Predictive 
      monitoring has recently been shown to save lives. Harnessing and analyzing the vast 
      amounts of physiologic data constantly displayed in ICU patients will lead to 
      improved algorithms for early detection, prognosis, and therapy of critical 
      illnesses.

TI  - Common pitfalls in interpreting pacemaker electrocardiograms in the emergency 
      department.
PG  - 616-21
LID - 10.1016/j.jelectrocard.2011.07.018 [doi]
AB  - The number of patients receiving pacemakers and defibrillators has grown 
      substantially over the last 20 years. In addition, the complexity and sophistication 
      of these devices have increased, making diagnosis of pacemaker problems using the 
      electrocardiogram (ECG) more difficult for clinicians in the emergency department. 
      This article will focus on a few of the pitfalls to be avoided when interpreting 
      paced ECGs. Pacemaker algorithms designed to minimize right ventricular pacing may 
      be confused with pathologic failure to output. Automatic capture threshold detection 
      schemes may be misinterpreted as failure to capture as well as undersensing due to 
      the extra "backup" pacemaker spikes noted on rhythm strips. Device testing done in 
      the emergency department may produce waveforms on monitor resembling ventricular 
      tachycardia if pacemaker-mediated tachycardia is produced accidentally. Ventricular 
      safety pacing algorithms may also be misinterpreted as failure to sense 
      appropriately, triggering questions about pacemaker malfunction. Certain types of 
      true undersensing may resemble morphologies consistent with pacemaker lead 
      dislodgment. In addition, sophisticated programming features designed to mimic 
      normal physiology could be misconstrued as pacemaker malfunction. These include 
      pacemaker hysteresis and sleep mode. The presence of frequent premature ventricular 
      complexes would cause a pacemaker to inhibit ventricular pacing appropriately. 
      However, this could produce a palpated heart rate that is substantially lower than 
      the programmed lower rate of the device due to reduced perfusion by the premature 
      ventricular complexes, again raising questions about the appropriate functioning of 
      the pacemaker. All of these situations will be discussed in detail along with 
      approaches to systematically examining the paced ECGs to minimize the risk of 
      misinterpretation. Pacemaker timing cycles as they relate to troubleshooting of the 
      paced ECG will also be introduced.

AB  - Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of deaths worldwide. The rising 
      mortality rate can be reduced by early detection and treatment interventions. 
      Clinically, electrocardiogram (ECG) signal provides useful information about the 
      cardiac abnormalities and hence employed as a diagnostic modality for the detection 
      of various CVDs. However, subtle changes in these time series indicate a particular 
      disease. Therefore, it may be monotonous, time-consuming and stressful to inspect 
      these ECG beats manually. In order to overcome this limitation of manual ECG signal 
      analysis, this paper uses a novel discrete wavelet transform (DWT) method combined 
      with nonlinear features for automated characterization of CVDs. ECG signals of 
      normal, and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and 
      myocardial infarction (MI) are subjected to five levels of DWT. Relative wavelet of 
      four nonlinear features such as fuzzy entropy, sample entropy, fractal dimension and 
      signal energy are extracted from the DWT coefficients. These features are fed to 
      sequential forward selection (SFS) technique and then ranked using ReliefF method. 
      Our proposed methodology achieved maximum classification accuracy (acc) of 99.27%, 
      sensitivity (sen) of 99.74%, and specificity (spec) of 98.08% with K-nearest 
      neighbor (kNN) classifier using 15 features ranked by the ReliefF method. Our 
      proposed methodology can be used by clinical staff to make faster and accurate 
      diagnosis of CVDs. Thus, the chances of survival can be significantly increased by 
      early detection and treatment of CVDs.

TI  - 12-lead Holter electrocardiography. Review of the literature and clinical 
      application update.

LID - 10.1007/s00399-013-0268-4 [doi]
AB  - This brief review is focused on 12-lead Holter electrocardiogram (ECG) recording 
      including a review of the literature and the description of the advantages of its 
      application. The standard 12-lead ECG provides a bedside snapshot of the electrical 
      activity of the heart including vector information, but a snapshot of a few beats 
      for some seconds might miss the whole story. Traditional Holter ECG displaying two 
      or three leads may record all heart beats during a prolonged period, but the limited 
      vector information might be a cause of shortcomings in the ECG diagnosis. The 
      12-lead Holter ECG overcomes these disadvantages and should be preferred for 
      detecting episodes of arrhythmias, localize their origin or the localization of 
      myocardial ischemia. The 12-lead Holter ECG monitoring is efficient in the 
      evaluation of the effect of drugs or interventional therapeutic procedures, i.e., 
      efficiency of biventricular pacing in patients with heart failure and permanent 
      atrial fibrillation (AF). The automatic analysis of parameters in 12-lead Holter ECG 
      is also providing information for risk stratification. In order to obtain a precise 
      diagnosis based on the criteria established on standard ECG, the "real" 12-lead ECG 
      with ten electrodes is advocated.

TI  - Semisupervised ECG Ventricular Beat Classification With Novelty Detection Based on 
      Switching Kalman Filters.
PG  - 2125-34
LID - 10.1109/TBME.2015.2402236 [doi]
AB  - Automatic processing and accurate diagnosis of pathological electrocardiogram (ECG) 
      signals remains a challenge. As long-term ECG recordings continue to increase in 
      prevalence, driven partly by the ease of remote monitoring technology usage, the 
      need to automate ECG analysis continues to grow. In previous studies, a model-based 
      ECG filtering approach to ECG data from healthy subjects has been applied to 
      facilitate accurate online filtering and analysis of physiological signals. We 
      propose an extension of this approach, which models not only normal and ventricular 
      heartbeats, but also morphologies not previously encountered. A switching Kalman 
      filter approach is introduced to enable the automatic selection of the most likely 
      mode (beat type), while simultaneously filtering the signal using appropriate prior 
      knowledge. Novelty detection is also made possible by incorporating a third mode for 
      the detection of unknown (not previously observed) morphologies, and denoted as 
      X-factor. This new approach is compared to state-of-the-art techniques for the 
      ventricular heartbeat classification in the MIT-BIH arrhythmia and Incart databases. 
      F1 scores of 98.3% and 99.5% were found on each database, respectively, which are 
      superior to other published algorithms' results reported on the same databases. Only 
      3% of all the beats were discarded as X-factor, and the majority of these beats 
      contained high levels of noise. The proposed technique demonstrates accurate beat 
      classification in the presence of previously unseen (and unlearned) morphologies and 
      noise, and provides an automated method for morphological analysis of arbitrary 
      (unknown) ECG leads.

TI  - Neurovascular Response during Exercise and Mental Stress in Anabolic Steroid Users.
PG  - 596-602
LID - 10.1249/MSS.0000000000001456 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Increased resting muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) and lower 
      forearm blood flow (FBF) were observed in young men who use anabolic androgenic 
      steroids (AAS). However, the response of MSNA and FBF in AAS users triggered by 
      muscle mechanoreflex and central command has never been tested. In addition, we 
      evaluated the blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) responses during these 
      maneuvers. METHODS: Nineteen AAS users (AASU) 31 ± 6 yr of age and 18 AAS nonusers 
      (AASNU) 29 ± 4 yr of age were recruited. All participants were involved in strength 
      training. AAS use was determined using a urine test (liquid chromatography with 
      tandem mass spectrometry). MSNA was measured using the microneurography technique. 
      FBF was measured by using venous occlusion plethysmography. BP was measured using an 
      automatic oscillometric device. HR was recorded continuously through ECG. Isometric 
      handgrip exercise was performed at 30% of the maximal voluntary contraction for 3 
      min, and mental stress was elicited by the Stroop color-word test for 4 min. 
      RESULTS: The MSNA and FBF responses during exercise were similar between AASU and 
      AASNU, with a trend toward higher MSNA (bursts per minute; P = 0.084) and lower 
      forearm vascular conductance (FVC; units; P = 0.084) in AASU than in AASNU. During 
      mental stress, AASU showed a significantly higher MSNA (P < 0.05) and lower FBF (P < 
      0.05) compared with AASNU. During both maneuvers, HR and BP increased linearly in 
      both groups; however, AASU showed a significantly higher HR compared with AASNU. 
      CONCLUSIONS: During muscle mechanoreflex activation (isometric exercise), AASU have 
      normal MSNA and FBF responses, whereas during central command (mental stress) 
      stimulation, AASU have exacerbated MSNA and blunted vasodilation. Therefore, mental 
      stress seems to exacerbate neurovascular control throughout stress reaction 
      situations in AASU.

TI  - Measures of spatiotemporal organization differentiate persistent from long-standing 
      atrial fibrillation.
PG  - 1125-31
LID - 10.1093/europace/eur436 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: This study presents an automatic diagnostic method for the discrimination 
      between persistent and long-standing atrial fibrillation (AF) based on the surface 
      electrocardiogram (ECG). METHODS AND RESULTS: Standard 12-lead ECG recordings were 
      acquired in 53 patients with either persistent (N= 20) or long-standing AF (N= 33), 
      the latter including both long-standing persistent and permanent AF. A combined 
      frequency analysis of multiple ECG leads followed by the computation of standard 
      complexity measures provided a method for the quantification of spatiotemporal AF 
      organization. All possible pairs of precordial ECG leads were analysed by this 
      method and resulting organization measures were used for automatic classification of 
      persistent and long-standing AF signals. Correct classification rates of 84.9% were 
      obtained, with a predictive value for long-standing AF of 93.1%. Spatiotemporal 
      organization as measured in lateral precordial leads V5 and V6 was shown to be 
      significantly lower during long-standing AF than persistent AF, suggesting that 
      time-related alterations in left atrial electrical activity can be detected in the 
      ECG. CONCLUSION: Accurate discrimination between persistent and long-standing AF 
      based on standard surface recordings was demonstrated. This information could 
      contribute to optimize the management of sustained AF, permitting appropriate 
      therapeutic decisions and thereby providing substantial clinical cost savings.

AB  - Published scientific literature contains millions of figures, including information 
      about the results obtained from different scientific experiments e.g. PCR-ELISA 
      data, microarray analysis, gel electrophoresis, mass spectrometry data, DNA/RNA 
      sequencing, diagnostic imaging (CT/MRI and ultrasound scans), and medicinal imaging 
      like electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG), echocardiography  
      (ECG), positron-emission tomography (PET) images. The importance of biomedical 
      figures has been widely recognized in scientific and medicine communities, as they 
      play a vital role in providing major original data, experimental and computational 
      results in concise form. One major challenge for implementing a system for 
      scientific literature analysis is extracting and analyzing text and figures from 
      published PDF files by physical and logical document analysis. Here we present a 
      product line architecture based bioinformatics tool 'Mining Scientific Literature 
      (MSL)', which supports the extraction of text and images by interpreting all kinds 
      of published PDF files using advanced data mining and image processing techniques. 
      It provides modules for the marginalization of extracted text based on different 
      coordinates and keywords, visualization of extracted figures and extraction of 
      embedded text from all kinds of biological and biomedical figures using applied 
      Optimal Character Recognition (OCR). Moreover, for further analysis and usage, it 
      generates the system's output in different formats including text, PDF, XML and 
      images files. Hence, MSL is an easy to install and use analysis tool to interpret 
      published scientific literature in PDF format.

TI  - Multicenter study verifying a method of noninvasive continuous cardiac output 
      measurement using pulse wave transit time: a comparison with intermittent bolus 
      thermodilution cardiac output.
PG  - 82-7
LID - 10.1213/ANE.0b013e31824e2b6c [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Many technologies have been developed for minimally invasive monitoring 
      of cardiac output. Estimated continuous cardiac output (esCCO) measurement using 
      pulse wave transit time is one noninvasive method. Because it does not require any 
      additional sensors other than those for conducting 3 basic forms of monitoring 
      (electrocardiogram, pulse oximeter wave, and noninvasive (or invasive) arterial 
      blood pressure measurement), esCCO measurement is potentially useful in routine 
      clinical circulatory monitoring for any patient including low-risk patients. We 
      evaluated the efficacy of noninvasive esCCO using pulse wave transit time in this 
      multicenter study. METHODS: We compared esCCO and intermittent bolus thermodilution 
      cardiac output (TDCO) in 213 patients, 139 intensive care units (ICUs), and 74 
      operating rooms (ORs), at 7 participating institutions. We performed 
      electrocardiogram, pulse oximetry, TDCO, and arterial blood pressure measurements in 
      patients in ICUs and ORs; a single calibration was performed to measure esCCO 
      continuously. TDCO measurement was performed once daily for ICU patients and every 
      hour for OR patients, and just before the removal of the pulmonary arterial catheter 
      from patients in both the ICU and OR. We evaluated esCCO against TDCO with 
      correlation analysis and Bland and Altman analysis and also assessed the change of 
      bias over time. Furthermore, we inspected the impact of change in systemic vascular 
      resistance (SVR) on change in bias because abnormal SVR was assumed to be a factor 
      contributing to the change of the bias. RESULTS: From among 588 esCCO and TDCO 
      datasets (excluding calibration points), 587 datasets were analyzed for 213 
      patients. The analysis results show a correlation coefficient of 0.79 (P < 0.0001, 
      95% confidence limits of 0.756-0.819), a bias (mean difference between esCCO and 
      TDCO) of 0.13 L/min (95% confidence interval of bias 0.04-0.22 L/min), and a 
      precision (1 SD) of 1.15 L/min (95% prediction interval was -2.13 to 2.39 L/min). 
      There were no significant differences among 3 defined time intervals over 48 hours 
      after calibration (repeated-measures analysis of variance P = 0.781) in the ICU. The 
      influence of SVR on esCCO analysis showed a correlation coefficient between SVR and 
      an error of 0.37 (P < 0.0001, 95% confidence interval 0.298-0.438). CONCLUSION: The 
      efficacy of noninvasive esCCO technology was compared with TDCO in 213 cases. Five 
      hundred eighty-seven datasets comparing esCCO and TDCO showed close correlation and 
      small bias and precision, which were comparable to current arterial waveform 
      analysis technologies.

TI  - Simplifying electronic data capture in clinical trials: workflow embedded image and 
      biosignal file integration and analysis via web services.
PG  - 571-80
LID - 10.1007/s10278-014-9694-z [doi]
AB  - To improve data quality and save cost, clinical trials are nowadays performed using 
      electronic data capture systems (EDCS) providing electronic case report forms (eCRF) 
      instead of paper-based CRFs. However, such EDCS are insufficiently integrated into 
      the medical workflow and lack in interfacing with other study-related systems. In 
      addition, most EDCS are unable to handle image and biosignal data, although 
      electrocardiography (EGC, as example for one-dimensional (1D) data), ultrasound (2D 
      data), or magnetic resonance imaging (3D data) have been established as surrogate 
      endpoints in clinical trials. In this paper, an integrated workflow based on 
      OpenClinica, one of the world's largest EDCS, is presented. Our approach consists of 
      three components for (i) sharing of study metadata, (ii) integration of large volume 
      data into eCRFs, and (iii) automatic image and biosignal analysis. In all 
      components, metadata is transferred between systems using web services and 
      JavaScript, and binary large objects (BLOBs) are sent via the secure file transfer 
      protocol and hypertext transfer protocol. We applied the close-looped workflow in a 
      multicenter study, where long term (7 days/24 h) Holter ECG monitoring is acquired 
      on subjects with diabetes. Study metadata is automatically transferred into 
      OpenClinica, the 4 GB BLOBs are seamlessly integrated into the eCRF, automatically 
      processed, and the results of signal analysis are written back into the eCRF 
      immediately.

TI  - A team-based approach to reducing cardiac monitor alarms.
PG  - e1686-94
LID - 10.1542/peds.2014-1162 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Excessive cardiac monitor alarms lead to desensitization 
      and alarm fatigue. We created and implemented a standardized cardiac monitor care 
      process (CMCP) on a 24-bed pediatric bone marrow transplant unit. The aim of this 
      project was to decrease monitor alarms through the use of team-based standardized 
      care and processes. METHODS: Using small tests of change, we developed and 
      implemented a standardized CMCP that included: (1) a process for initial ordering of 
      monitor parameters based on age-appropriate standards; (2) pain-free daily 
      replacement of electrodes; (3) daily individualized assessment of cardiac monitor 
      parameters; and (4) a reliable method for appropriate discontinuation of monitor. 
      The Model for Improvement was used to design, test, and implement changes. The 
      changes that were implemented after testing and adaptation were: family/patient 
      engagement in the CMCP; creation of a monitor care log to address parameters, lead 
      changes, and discontinuation; development of a pain-free process for electrode 
      removal; and customized monitor delay and customized threshold parameters. RESULTS: 
      From January to November 2013, percent compliance with each of the 4 components of 
      the CMCP increased. Overall compliance with the CMCP increased from a median of 38% 
      to 95%. During this time, the median number of alarms per patient-day decreased from 
      180 to 40. CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of the standardized CMCP resulted in a 
      significant decrease in cardiac monitor alarms per patient day. We recommend a 
      team-based approach to monitor care, including individualized assessment of monitor 
      parameters, daily lead change, and proper discontinuation of the monitors.

      Signal.
PG  - 78-86
LID - 10.1109/TBME.2016.2539421 [doi]
AB  - Long-term electrocardiogram (ECG) has become one of the important diagnostic assist 
      methods in clinical cardiovascular domain. Long-term ECG is primarily used for the 
      detection of various cardiovascular diseases that are caused by various cardiac 
      arrhythmia such as myocardial infarction, cardiomyopathy, and myocarditis. In the 
      past few years, the development of an automatic heartbeat classification method has 
      been a challenge. With the accumulation of medical data, personalized heartbeat 
      classification of a patient has become possible. For the long-term data accumulation 
      method, such as the holter, it is difficult to obtain the analysis results in a 
      short time using the original method of serial design. The pressure to develop a 
      personalized automatic classification model is high. To solve these challenges, this 
      paper implemented a parallel general regression neural network (GRNN) to classify 
      the heartbeat, and achieved a 95% accuracy according to the Association for the 
      Advancement of Medical Instrumentation. We designed an online learning program to 
      form a personalized classification model for patients. The achieved accuracy of the 
      model is 88% compared to the specific ECG data of the patients. The efficiency of 
      the parallel GRNN with GTX780Ti can improve by 450 times.

TI  - Comparison of QT Interval Readings in Normal Sinus Rhythm Between a Smartphone Heart 
      Monitor and a 12-Lead ECG for Healthy Volunteers and Inpatients Receiving Sotalol or 
      Dofetilide.
PG  - 827-32
LID - 10.1111/jce.12976 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: A variety of medications ranging from antiarrhythmics to 
      psychotropics, as well as conditions such as bradycardia, can prolong the QT 
      interval, increasing the risk for life-threatening arrhythmias. Monitoring the 
      corrected QT interval (QTc) is therefore critical for patient safety. The recent 
      development of smart phone heart monitors (SHM) may allow for easier QTc monitoring. 
      We sought to evaluate the accuracy of an SHM for assessing the QTc, as compared to 
      the standard 12-lead ECG. METHODS AND RESULTS: We compared the QTc interval in 
      lead-I and lead-II between an SHM and 12-lead ECG. Healthy volunteers and 
      hospitalized patients in sinus rhythm being loaded on dofetilide or sotalol were 
      included. Manual and automatic measurements were studied. Across 99 healthy 
      volunteers, the SHM QTc demonstrated good agreement (bias = 4 milliseconds, standard 
      deviation of bias = 11 milliseconds) compared to the 12-lead ECG, using the 
      Bland-Altman method of agreement. Across all hospitalized patients, the SHM was 
      capable of demonstrating QTc prolongation. Between the 12-lead ECG and SHM, lead-I 
      measurements had reasonable agreement (bias = 3 milliseconds, standard deviation of 
      bias = 46 milliseconds). A QTc of > 500 milliseconds was associated with a higher 
      likelihood (OR = 12.0; 95% CI 1.5-111.4; P = 0.02) to not achieve perfect agreement. 
      CONCLUSION: The SHM is accurate in measuring QTc interval in sinus rhythm when 
      compared to 12-lead ECG in healthy volunteers. For patients receiving QT prolonging 
      antiarrhythmics, SHM is capable of detecting QTc prolongation, and lead-I of the SHM 
      is most accurate in measuring the QTc if < 500 milliseconds.

TI  - Optimal Multi-Stage Arrhythmia Classification Approach.

LID - 2898
AB  - Arrhythmia constitutes a problem with the rate or rhythm of the heartbeat, and an 
      early diagnosis is essential for the timely inception of successful treatment. We 
      have jointly optimized the entire multi-stage arrhythmia classification scheme based 
      on 12-lead surface ECGs that attains the accuracy performance level of professional 
      cardiologists. The new approach is comprised of a three-step noise reduction stage, 
      a novel feature extraction method and an optimal classification model with finely 
      tuned hyperparameters. We carried out an exhaustive study comparing thousands of 
      competing classification algorithms that were trained on our proprietary, large and 
      expertly labeled dataset consisting of 12-lead ECGs from 40,258 patients with four 
      arrhythmia classes: atrial fibrillation, general supraventricular tachycardia, sinus 
      bradycardia and sinus rhythm including sinus irregularity rhythm. Our results show 
      that the optimal approach consisted of Low Band Pass filter, Robust LOESS, Non Local 
      Means smoothing, a proprietary feature extraction method based on percentiles of the 
      empirical distribution of ratios of interval lengths and magnitudes of peaks and 
      valleys, and Extreme Gradient Boosting Tree classifier, achieved an F(1)-Score of 
      0.988 on patients without additional cardiac conditions. The same noise reduction 
      and feature extraction methods combined with Gradient Boosting Tree classifier 
      achieved an F(1)-Score of 0.97 on patients with additional cardiac conditions. Our 
      method achieved the highest classification accuracy (average 10-fold 
      cross-validation F(1)-Score of 0.992) using an external validation data, MIT-BIH 
      arrhythmia database. The proposed optimal multi-stage arrhythmia classification 
      approach can dramatically benefit automatic ECG data analysis by providing 
      cardiologist level accuracy and robust compatibility with various ECG data sources.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Identification of atrial fibrillation (AF) is a clinical imperative. 
      Heartbeat interval time series are increasingly available from personal monitors, 
      allowing new opportunity for AF diagnosis. GOAL: Previously, we devised numerical 
      algorithms for identification of normal sinus rhythm (NSR), AF, and SR with frequent 
      ectopy using dynamical measures of heart rate. Here, we wished to validate them in 
      the canonical MIT-BIH ECG databases. METHODS: We tested algorithms on the NSR, AF 
      and arrhythmia databases. RESULTS: When the databases were combined, the positive 
      predictive value of the new algorithms exceeded 95% for NSR and AF, and was 40% for 
      SR with ectopy. Further, dynamical measures did not distinguish atrial from 
      ventricular ectopy. Inspection of individual 24hour records showed good correlation 
      of observed and predicted rhythms. CONCLUSION: Heart rate dynamical measures are 
      effective ingredients in numerical algorithms to classify cardiac rhythm from the 
      heartbeat intervals time series alone.

TI  - Time-frequency analysis of heart rate variability for neonatal seizure detection.
PG  - 67-72
AB  - The ECG has been much neglected in automatic seizure detection in the newborn. 
      Changes in heart rate and ECG rhythm are often found in animal and adult patients 
      with seizure. However, little is known about heart rate variability (HRV) changes in 
      human neonate during seizure. Results of ongoing time-frequency research are 
      presented here with the aim to compare the performance of various time-frequency 
      distributions (TFDs) when applied to HRV time series for non-seizure and seizure 
      newborns. The TFDs studied are the Wigner-Ville (WVD), the Spectrogram (SP), the 
      Choi-Williams (CWD) and the Modified B (MBD) distributions. Based on our preliminary 
      results, our current conclusion is MBD outperforms other TFDs in terms of 
      time-frequency resolution, cross-terms suppression and to represent the newborn HRV 
      signals of non-seizure and seizure which are closely-spaced components in the 
      time-frequency domain.

TI  - False arrhythmia alarms reduction in the intensive care unit: a multimodal approach.
PG  - 1217-32
LID - 10.1088/0967-3334/37/8/1217 [doi]
AB  - The purpose of this study was to develop algorithms to lower the incidence of false 
      arrhythmia alarms in the ICU using information from independent sources, namely 
      electrocardiogram (ECG), arterial blood pressure (ABP) and photoplethysmogram (PPG). 
      Our approach relies on robust adaptive signal processing techniques in order to 
      extract accurate heart rate (HR) values from the different waveforms. Based on the 
      quality of available signals, heart rate was either estimated from pulsatile 
      waveforms using an adaptive frequency tracking algorithm or computed from ECGs using 
      an adaptive mathematical morphology approach. Furthermore, we developed a 
      supplementary measure based on the spectral purity of the ECGs to determine whether 
      a ventricular tachycardia or flutter/fibrillation arrhythmia has taken place. 
      Finally, alarm veracity was determined based on a set of decision rules on HR and 
      spectral purity values. The proposed method was evaluated on the PhysioNet/CinC 
      Challenge 2015 database, which is composed of 1250 life-threatening alarm 
      recordings, each categorized into either bradycardia, tachycardia, asystole, 
      ventricular tachycardia or ventricular flutter/fibrillation arrhythmia. This 
      resulted in overall true positive rates of 95%/99% and overall true negative rates 
      of 76%/80% on the real-time and retrospective subsets of the test dataset, 
      respectively.

TI  - Signal quality measures for pulse oximetry through waveform morphology analysis.
PG  - 369-84
LID - 10.1088/0967-3334/32/3/008 [doi]
AB  - Pulse oximetry has been extensively used to estimate oxygen saturation in blood, a 
      vital physiological parameter commonly used when monitoring a subject's health 
      status. However, accurate estimation of this parameter is difficult to achieve when 
      the fundamental signal from which it is derived, the photoplethysmograph (PPG), is 
      contaminated with noise artifact induced by movement of the subject or the 
      measurement apparatus. This study presents a novel method for automatic rejection of 
      artifact contaminated pulse oximetry waveforms, based on waveform morphology 
      analysis. The performance of the proposed algorithm is compared to a manually 
      annotated gold standard. The creation of the gold standard involved two experts 
      identifying sections of the PPG signal containing good quality PPG pulses and/or 
      noise, in 104 fingertip PPG signals, using a simultaneous electrocardiograph (ECG) 
      signal as a reference signal. The fingertip PPG signals were each 1 min in duration 
      and were acquired from 13 healthy subjects (10 males and 3 females). Each signal 
      contained approximately 20 s of purposely induced artifact noise from a variety of 
      activities involving subject movement. Some unique waveform morphology features were 
      extracted from the PPG signals, which were believed to be correlated with signal 
      quality. A simple decision-tree classifier was employed to arrive at a 
      classification decision, at a pulse-by-pulse resolution, of whether a pulse was of 
      acceptable quality for use or not. The performance of the algorithm was assessed 
      using Cohen's kappa coefficient (κ), sensitivity, specificity and accuracy measures. 
      A mean κ of 0.64 ± 0.22 was obtained, while the mean sensitivity, specificity and 
      accuracy were 89 ± 10%, 77 ± 19% and 83 ± 11%, respectively. Furthermore, a heart 
      rate estimate, extracted from uncontaminated sections of PPG, as identified by the 
      algorithm, was compared with the heart rate derived from an uncontaminated 
      simultaneous ECG signal. The mean error between both heart rate readings was 0.49 ± 
      0.66 beats per minute (BPM), in comparison to an error value observed without using 
      the artifact detection algorithm of 7.23 ± 5.78 BPM. These results demonstrate that 
      automated identification of signal artifact in the PPG signal through waveform 
      morphology analysis is achievable. In addition, a clear improvement in the accuracy 
      of the derived heart rate is also evident when such methods are employed.

TI  - Selecting EEG components using time series analysis in brain death diagnosis.
PG  - 311-9
LID - 10.1007/s11571-010-9149-2 [doi]
AB  - In diagnosis of brain death for human organ transplant, EEG (electroencephalogram) 
      must be flat to conclude the patient's brain death but it has been reported that the 
      flat EEG test is sometimes difficult due to artifacts such as the contamination from 
      the power supply and ECG (electrocardiogram, the signal from the heartbeat). ICA 
      (independent component analysis) is an effective signal processing method that can 
      separate such artifacts from the EEG signals. Applying ICA to EEG channels, we 
      obtain several separated components among which some correspond to the brain 
      activities while others contain artifacts. This paper aims at automatic selection of 
      the separated components based on time series analysis. In the flat EEG test in 
      brain death diagnosis, such automatic component selection is helpful.

      disabling stroke. A continuous heart-rate monitoring device, comfortable enough to 
      be worn continuously and reliable enough to detect AF, would allow for prompt 
      initiation of anticoagulation therapy to prevent stroke. METHODS: We studied a new 
      custom-made wearable photo-plethysmograph [PPG] wrist-watch sensor, specifically 
      designed for continuous heart rate monitoring and incorporating contact and motion 
      noise-filters. We tested its ability to automatically detect AF in patients 
      undergoing elective cardioversion of AF, using simultaneously recorded 
      electrocardiogram [ECG] as gold standard. RESULTS: A total of 18,608 consecutive 
      R-R-interval measurements were recorded simultaneously with PPG and ECG in 20 
      patients, including 12,521 [67.3%] R-R-intervals during AF and 6087 [32.7%] R-R 
      intervals during sinus rhythm. Scatter plots and Bland-Altman plots demonstrated 
      that the PPG signals were highly correlated to the simultaneously recorded ECG 
      [R = 0.980, p < 0.001], both during AF and during sinus rhythm. The automatic 
      algorithm distinguished AF from sinus rhythm with a sensitivity of 100% and 
      specificity of 93.1%. CONCLUSIONS: This PPG-based wrist-watch sensor reliably 
      detected AF in non-ambulatory patients.

TI  - Patient-Specific Classification of ICU Sedation Levels From Heart Rate Variability.
PG  - e683-e690
LID - 10.1097/CCM.0000000000002364 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop a personalizable algorithm to discriminate between sedation 
      levels in ICU patients based on heart rate variability. DESIGN: Multicenter, pilot 
      study. SETTING: Several ICUs at Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA. 
      PATIENTS: We gathered 21,912 hours of routine electrocardiogram recordings from a 
      heterogenous group of 70 adult ICU patients. All patients included in the study were 
      mechanically ventilated and were receiving sedatives. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: 
      As "ground truth" for developing our method, we used Richmond Agitation Sedation 
      Scale scores grouped into four levels denoted "comatose" (-5), "deeply sedated" (-4 
      to -3), "lightly sedated" (-2 to 0), and "agitated" (+1 to +4). We trained a support 
      vector machine learning algorithm to calculate the probability of each sedation 
      level from heart rate variability measures derived from the electrocardiogram. To 
      estimate algorithm performance, we calculated leave-one-subject out cross-validated 
      accuracy. The patient-independent version of the proposed system discriminated 
      between the four sedation levels with an overall accuracy of 59%. Upon personalizing 
      the system supplementing the training data with patient-specific calibration data, 
      consisting of an individual's labeled heart rate variability epochs from the 
      preceding 24 hours, accuracy improved to 67%. The personalized system discriminated 
      between light- and deep-sedation states with an average accuracy of 75%. 
      CONCLUSIONS: With further refinement, the methodology reported herein could lead to 
      a fully automated system for depth of sedation monitoring. By enabling monitoring to 
      be continuous, such technology may help clinical staff to monitor sedation levels 
      more effectively and to reduce complications related to over- and under sedation.

TI  - Sensitivity and specificity of automated detection of early repolarization in 
      standard 12-lead electrocardiography.
PG  - 355-61
LID - 10.1111/anec.12226 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Early repolarization (ER) is defined as an elevation of the QRS-ST 
      junction in at least two inferior or lateral leads of the standard 12-lead 
      electrocardiogram (ECG). Our purpose was to create an algorithm for the automated 
      detection and classification of ER. METHODS: A total of 6,047 electrocardiograms 
      were manually graded for ER by two experienced readers. The automated detection of 
      ER was based on quantification of the characteristic slurring or notching in 
      ER-positive leads. The ER detection algorithm was tested and its results were 
      compared with manual grading, which served as the reference. RESULTS: Readers graded 
      183 ECGs (3.0%) as ER positive, of which the algorithm detected 176 recordings, 
      resulting in sensitivity of 96.2%. Of the 5,864 ER-negative recordings, the 
      algorithm classified 5,281 as negative, resulting in 90.1% specificity. Positive and 
      negative predictive values for the algorithm were 23.2% and 99.9%, respectively, and 
      its accuracy was 90.2%. Inferior ER was correctly detected in 84.6% and lateral ER 
      in 98.6% of the cases. CONCLUSIONS: As the automatic algorithm has high sensitivity, 
      it could be used as a prescreening tool for ER; only the electrocardiograms graded 
      positive by the algorithm would be reviewed manually. This would reduce the need for 
      manual labor by 90%.

TI  - How to define end-diastole and end-systole?: Impact of timing on strain 
      measurements.

LID - S1936-878X(14)00936-X [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jcmg.2014.10.010 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate to what extent timing definitions 
      influence strain measurements and which surrogates are reliable and feasible to 
      define end-diastole (ED) and end-systole (ES) during speckle-tracking (STI) 
      analysis. BACKGROUND: Current STI-based strain measurements are highly automated. It 
      remains unclear when a particular analysis software defines the zero baseline and 
      the systolic strain measurement position. METHODS: A total of 60 subjects (20 
      healthy volunteers, 20 patients with coronary artery disease, and 20 patients with 
      typical left bundle-branch block) underwent a complete echocardiographic 
      examination. In one-half of them, a real M-mode through the mitral valve was 
      acquired for each electrocardiographic (ECG) lead of the echo machine. Timing of 
      peak R and automatic ECG trigger were compared with mitral valve closure for every 
      electrode. Mitral and aortic valve closure, as observed in the apical 3-chamber 
      view, served as reference for ED and ES. With the use of these references, 
      end-systolic global longitudinal strain (ES-GLS) and end-systolic segmental 
      longitudinal strain (ES-SLS) longitudinal end-systolic strain were measured at 
      baseline and after changing the definition of either ED or ES by ±4 frames. 
      Furthermore, strain and volume curves derived from the same tracking, as well as the 
      Doppler interrogation of the valves, were compared with the references. RESULTS: 
      Depending on the selected lead, timing of the ECG-derived time markers changed 
      considerably compared with mitral valve closure. Changing the definition of ED and 
      ES resulted in significantly different ES-GLS and ES-SLS values in all subjects. 
      ES-SLS in dyssynchronous hearts showed the highest sensitivity to timing definition. 
      From all methods, spectral Doppler was the most reliable time marker in all subjects 
      (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Exact temporal definition of ED and ES has a major impact 
      on the accuracy of strain measurements. After direct observation of the valves, 
      Doppler evaluation is the best means for characterizing ED and ES for STI analysis.

TI  - Non-linear dynamics of cardiovascular system in humans exposed to repetitive apneas 
      modeling obstructive sleep apnea: aggregated time series data analysis.
PG  - 106-15
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Testing the hypothesis that alterations in non-linear dynamics of the 
      cardiovascular variability appear in healthy, awake subjects during voluntary apnea. 
      SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Ten young subjects performed 20 apneas 60 s each separated by 
      1 min free breathing. Inter-beat interval (IBI) measured as RR-interval in ECG, 
      systolic (SYS) and diastolic (DIAS) arterial blood pressure. stroke volume (SV), 
      cardiac output (CO) and total peripheral resistance (TPR) were non-invasively 
      recorded and computed by Portapress 2 system. Correlation dimension according to 
      Grassberger-Proccacia algorithm (CD) and ratio of % determinism versus % recurrence 
      (RDR) computed from recurrence plot according to Webber and Zbiluth [J. Appl. 
      Physiol. 76 (1994) 965] were used as the indices of chaos and complexity. Sequential 
      time series of cardiovascular variables in consecutive 60-s apneas and inter-apnea 
      free breathings were separately windowed and aggregated. CD and RDR of aggregated 
      apneic time series were compared with CD and RDR values of aggregated time series of 
      inter-apnea free breathing, 10 min at rest and 10 min recovery. Reliability of the 
      aggregation method of sequential time series was tested on transformed simulated 
      data generated by Lorenz model. Error in CD and RDR estimation did not exceed 5% and 
      1%. respectively. RESULTS: CD of cardiovascular variables computed from aggregated 
      apneas was significantly reduced and RDR augmented versus control and recovery 
      periods. CD and RDR values of inter-apnea phases were in between those in control 
      and during apneas. Time domain linear variance (SD) was increased during aggregated 
      apneas. CONCLUSIONS: Signal dynamics dependent windowing and data aggregation could 
      be a useful tool for non-linear analysis of short repeatable sequential time series; 
      time domain linear variability of the cardiovascular dynamics is augmented while 
      complexity reduced during apneic chemoreceptor stimulation; alterations in 
      non-linear dynamics of cardiovascular variables during apneas in healthy 
      normotensive subjects may suggest an early sign of a mechanism implicated in 
      arterial hypertension in OSAS.

TI  - Comparison of QT/RR relation based on a 15-s averaged ECG and a single beat ECG 
      during atrial fibrillation.
PG  - 274-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to compare QT/RR relation based on a 15-s 
      averaged beat ECG with a single beat ECG during atrial fibrillation (AF) and to 
      determine which was better to estimate the QT interval after sinus restoration. 
      METHODS AND RESULTS: QT and RR intervals were measured using an automatic QT 
      analyzing system in 33 patients who had both AF and sinus rhythm on the same 24-h 
      Holter ECG recording. In 14 patients, antiarrhythmic drugs (AAD) were administered. 
      QT/RR relations were analyzed from ECG waves obtained by the summation of 
      consecutive QRS-T complexes during each 15-s period (QT/RR-average) and a single 
      beat QRS-T (QT/RR-single). During sinus rhythm, the slope of QT/RR-average did not 
      differ from that of QT/RR-single in patients with and without AAD. On the other 
      hand, during AF, the slope of QT/RR-average was significantly greater than that of 
      QT/RR-single (without AAD: 0.12±0.06 vs. 0.06±0.03, P<0.001; with AAD: 0.15±0.05 vs. 
      0.08±0.04, P<0.001). During AF, the QT interval at an RR interval of 1.2-s (QT-1.2) 
      determined from QT/RR-average was significantly greater than QT-1.2 from 
      QT/RR-single in patients with and without AAD. QT-1.2 in QT/RR-single during AF was 
      significantly smaller than that during sinus rhythm but QT-1.2 in QT/RR-average 
      during AF was not. CONCLUSIONS: The QT interval after sinus restoration could be 
      estimated better using QT/RR-average than using QT/RR-single during AF.

LID - 1112
AB  - Experimentally and clinically collected time series data are often contaminated with 
      significant confounding noise, creating short, noisy time series. This noise, due to 
      natural variability and measurement error, poses a challenge to conventional change 
      point detection methods. We propose a novel and robust statistical method for change 
      point detection for noisy biological time sequences. Our method is a significant 
      improvement over traditional change point detection methods, which only examine a 
      potential anomaly at a single time point. In contrast, our method considers all 
      suspected anomaly points and considers the joint probability distribution of the 
      number of change points and the elapsed time between two consecutive anomalies. We 
      validate our method with three simulated time series, a widely accepted benchmark 
      data set, two geological time series, a data set of ECG recordings, and a 
      physiological data set of heart rate variability measurements of fetal sheep model 
      of human labor, comparing it to three existing methods. Our method demonstrates 
      significantly improved performance over the existing point-wise detection methods.

AB  - BACKGROUND: It is estimated that 33.5 million people in the world have developed 
      atrial fibrillation (AF), and an estimated 30% of patients with AF are unaware of 
      their diagnosis (silent AF). OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to test a new 
      technology for contactless detection of AF based on facial video recordings. 
      METHODS: The proposed technique uses a camera to record an individual's face and 
      extract the subtle beat-to-beat variations of skin color reflecting the cardiac 
      pulsatile signal. In a group of adults referred for electrical cardioversion, we 
      recorded the ECG and the video of the subjects' face before and after electrical 
      cardioversion. We extracted the beat-to-beat pulse rates expressed as pulses per 
      minute (ppm) from the videoplethysmographic (VPG) signal acquired using a standard 
      web camera. We introduce a novel quantifier of pulse variability called the pulse 
      harmonic strength (PHS) and report its ability to detect the presence of AF. 
      RESULTS: Eleven subjects (8 male; age 65 ± 6 years) were included in the study. The 
      VPG and ECG-based rates were statistically different between the AF and sinus rhythm 
      periods: 72 ± 9 ppm vs 57 ± 7 ppm (P < .0001) for VPG and 80 ± 17 bpm vs 56 ± 7 bpm 
      (P < .0001) for ECG signals. Among the 407 epochs of 15 seconds of synchronized ECG 
      and VPG signals, PHS was associated with a 20% detection error rate, and the error 
      rates of the automatic ECG-based measurements ranged between 17% and 29%. 
      CONCLUSION: Our preliminary results support the concept that contactless video-based 
      monitoring of the human face for detection of abnormal pulse variability due to AF 
      is feasible.

TI  - Development of a Multisensory Wearable System for Monitoring Cigarette Smoking 
      Behavior in Free-Living Conditions.
LID - 104 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/electronics6040104 [doi]
AB  - This paper presents the development and validation of a novel multi-sensory wearable 
      system (Personal Automatic Cigarette Tracker v2 or PACT2.0) for monitoring of 
      cigarette smoking in free-living conditions. The contributions of the PACT2.0 system 
      are: (1) the implementation of a complete sensor suite for monitoring of all major 
      behavioral manifestations of cigarette smoking (lighting events, hand-to-mouth 
      gestures, and smoke inhalations); (2) a miniaturization of the sensor hardware to 
      enable its applicability in naturalistic settings; and (3) an introduction of new 
      sensor modalities that may provide additional insight into smoking behavior e.g., 
      Global Positioning System (GPS), pedometer and Electrocardiogram(ECG) or provide an 
      easy-to-use alternative (e.g., bio-impedance respiration sensor) to traditional 
      sensors. PACT2.0 consists of three custom-built devices: an instrumented lighter, a 
      hand module, and a chest module. The instrumented lighter is capable of recording 
      the time and duration of all lighting events. The hand module integrates Inertial 
      Measurement Unit (IMU) and a Radio Frequency (RF) transmitter to track the 
      hand-to-mouth gestures. The module also operates as a pedometer. The chest module 
      monitors the breathing (smoke inhalation) patterns (inductive and bio-impedance 
      respiratory sensors), cardiac activity (ECG sensor), chest movement (three-axis 
      accelerometer), hand-to-mouth proximity (RF receiver), and captures the geo-position 
      of the subject (GPS receiver). The accuracy of PACT2.0 sensors was evaluated in 
      bench tests and laboratory experiments. Use of PACT2.0 for data collection in the 
      community was validated in a 24 h study on 40 smokers. Of 943 h of recorded data, 
      98.6% of the data was found usable for computer analysis. The recorded information 
      included 549 lighting events, 522/504 consumed cigarettes (from lighter 
      data/self-registered data, respectively), 20,158/22,207 hand-to-mouth gestures (from 
      hand IMU/proximity sensor, respectively) and 114,217/112,175 breaths (from the 
      respiratory inductive plethysmograph (RIP)/bio-impedance sensor, respectively). The 
      proposed system scored 8.3 ± 0.31 out of 10 on a post-study acceptability survey. 
      The results suggest that PACT2.0 presents a reliable platform for studying of 
      smoking behavior at the community level.

AB  - The aim of this study is to evaluate the discriminative power of sequential spectrum 
      analysis of the short-term electrocardiogram (ECG) time series in separating normal 
      and congestive heart failure (CHF) subjects. The raw ECG time series is transformed 
      into a series of discretized binary symbols and the distribution of mono-sequences 
      (i.e., tuples containing only one type of symbol '0' or '1') is computed. The 
      relative distribution of mono-sequences containing only one type of symbol 
      constitutes binary occupancy for that symbol in the sequential spectrum. The 
      quantified approximate entropies of the binary occupancies in the sequential spectra 
      are found to have potential in discriminating normal and CHF subjects and thus can 
      significantly add to the prognostic value of traditional cardiac analysis. The 
      statistical analyses and the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis 
      confirm the robustness of this new approach, which exhibits an average accuracy, 
      average sensitivity, average positive predictivity, and average specificity, all 
      100.0%.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiogoniometry (CGM), a spatiotemporal electrocardiologic method may 
      be useful as a cardiovascular diagnostic tool. Increased incidence of coronary 
      artery or myocardial involvement and defects in automatic setting of heart activity 
      have been reported in psoriasis which could be related to the presence of systemic 
      inflammation. Cardiogoniometry and the related parameters have been used in this 
      study as a diagnostic technique in psoriasis patients. METHODS: Thirty patients with 
      psoriasis and 30 healthy, age and sex-matched individuals with no history of 
      cardiovascular diseases or traditional coronary risk factors were enrolled. Duration 
      and severity of the disease, using psoriasis severity and area index (PASI) score 
      were recorded. Electrocardiography and cardiogoniometry were performed. Heart rate, 
      QT interval and QT dispersion (QTD) were measured. SDNN (standard deviation of 
      normal R-R interval) and myocardial ischemia score were determined by 
      cardiogoniometry. RESULTS: There was significant difference between the psoriasis 
      patients and the controls in terms of heart rate (76.37±14.41 vs 72.53±9.684, 
      p=0.02), myocardial ischemia score (-1.53±2.63 vs -0.46±0.73, p=0.037), corrected QT 
      interval (392.64±26.00 vs 377.26±22.34, p=0.017) and QTD (32.00±17.88 vs 6.67±15.16, 
      p<0.001). No statistically significant difference was found in SDNN (36.37±21.01 vs 
      26.90±14.88, p=.29). There were moderate correlation between PASI and SDNN (r=0.427, 
      p=0.009), heart rate (r=0.427, p=.009) and score (r=0.481, p=.004). CONCLUSION: 
      Abnormalities in resting ECG and CGM and their correlation with disease severity 
      raises concerns about the need for cardiovascular follow-ups of psoriatic patients, 
      especially those with severe disease.

TI  - Respiratory sinus arrhythmia: an index of light anaesthesia.
PG  - 212-7
AB  - This study was designed to test if changes in the degree of respiratory sinus 
      arrhythmia (RSA) can be used as an index of light anaesthesia. An on-line, real-time 
      data logging system was used to record simultaneously the EEG and ECG waveforms from 
      10 patients undergoing routine surgery using i.v. propofol (Diprivan) anaesthesia. 
      The degree of RSA was determined in real-time. The median frequency of the EEG was 
      derived off-line and correlated with the degree of RSA. Time series analysis was 
      performed on the derived indices off-line. Significant changes in the degree of RSA 
      occurred in response to changes in propofol infusion in all patients; these changes 
      corresponded also to changes in the median frequency of the EEG. Heart rate and 
      ventilatory frequency are measured routinely during surgery and it is suggested that 
      on-line monitoring of RSA, derived from these standard signals, provides a more 
      convenient and objective index of lightening anaesthesia than either EEG analysis or 
      classical estimates of anaesthetic depth based on arterial pressure or heart rate.

AB  - Autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity and imbalance between its sympathetic and 
      parasympathetic components are important factors contributing to the initiation and 
      progression of many cardiovascular disorders related to obesity. The results on 
      respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) magnitude changes as a parasympathetic index were 
      not straightforward in previous studies on young obese subjects. Considering the 
      potentially unbalanced ANS regulation with impaired parasympathetic control in obese 
      patients, the aim of this study was to compare the relative contribution of 
      baroreflex and non-baroreflex (central) mechanisms to the origin of RSA in obese vs. 
      control subjects. To this end, we applied a recently proposed information-theoretic 
      methodology - partial information decomposition (PID) - to the time series of heart 
      rate variability (HRV, computed from RR intervals in the ECG), systolic blood 
      pressure (SBP) variability, and respiration (RESP) pattern measured in 29 obese and 
      29 age- and gender-matched non-obese adolescents and young adults monitored in the 
      resting supine position and during postural and cognitive stress evoked by head-up 
      tilt and mental arithmetic. PID was used to quantify the so-called unique 
      information transferred from RESP to HRV and from SBP to HRV, reflecting, 
      respectively, non-baroreflex and RESP-unrelated baroreflex HRV mechanisms, and the 
      redundant information transferred from (RESP, SBP) to HRV, reflecting RESP-related 
      baroreflex RSA mechanisms. Our results suggest that obesity is associated: (i) with 
      blunted involvement of non-baroreflex RSA mechanisms, documented by the lower unique 
      information transferred from RESP to HRV at rest; and (ii) with a reduced response 
      to postural stress (but not to mental stress), documented by the lack of changes in 
      the unique information transferred from RESP and SBP to HRV in obese subjects moving 
      from supine to upright, and by a decreased redundant information transfer in obese 
      compared to controls in the upright position. These findings were observed in the 
      presence of an unchanged RSA magnitude measured as the high frequency (HF) power of 
      HRV, thus suggesting that the changes in ANS imbalance related to obesity in 
      adolescents and young adults are subtle and can be revealed by dissecting RSA 
      mechanisms into its components during various challenges.

TI  - Reducing false arrhythmia alarms in the ICU using multimodal signals and robust QRS 
      detection.

LID - 10.1088/0967-3334/37/8/1340 [doi]
AB  - This study developed algorithms to decrease the arrhythmia false alarms in the ICU 
      by processing multimodal signals of photoplethysmography (PPG), arterial blood 
      pressure (ABP), and two ECG signals. The goal was to detect the five critical 
      arrhythmias comprising asystole (ASY), extreme bradycardia (EBR), extreme 
      tachycardia (ETC), ventricular tachycardia (VTA), and ventricular flutter or 
      fibrillation (VFB). The different characteristics of the arrhythmias suggested the 
      application of individual signal processing for each alarm and the combination of 
      the algorithms to enhance false alarm detection. Thus, different features and signal 
      processing techniques were used for each arrhythmia type. The ECG signals were first 
      processed to reduce the signal interference. Then, a Hilbert-transform based QRS 
      detector algorithm was utilized to identify the QRS complexes, which were then 
      processed to determine the instantaneous heart rate. The pulsatile signals (PPG and 
      ABP) were processed to discover the pulse onset of beats which were then employed to 
      measure the heart rate. The signal quality index (SQI) of the signals was 
      implemented to verify the integrity of the heart rate information. The overall score 
      obtained by our algorithms in the 2015 Computing in Cardiology Challenge was a score 
      of 74.03% for retrospective and 69.92% for real-time analysis.

AB  - This study was to investigate and define what is considered as a current clinical 
      practice in hemodynamic monitoring and vasoactive medication use after cardiac 
      surgery in Italy. A 33-item questionnaire was sent to all intensive care units 
      (ICUs) admitting patients after cardiac surgery. 71 out of 92 identified centers 
      (77.2 %) returned a completed questionnaire. Electrocardiogram, invasive blood 
      pressure, central venous pressure, pulse oximetry, diuresis, body temperature and 
      blood gas analysis were identified as routinely used hemodynamic monitoring, whereas 
      advanced monitoring was performed with pulmonary artery catheter or 
      echocardiography. Crystalloids were the fluids of choice for volume replacement 
      (86.8 % of Centers). To guide volume management, central venous pressure (26.7 %) 
      and invasive blood pressure (19.7 %) were the most frequently used parameters. 
      Dobutamine was the first choice for treatment of left heart dysfunction (40 %) and 
      epinephrine was the first choice for right heart dysfunction (26.8 %). Half of the 
      Centers had an internal protocol for vasoactive drugs administration. Intra-aortic 
      balloon pump and extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation were widely available among 
      Cardiothoracic ICUs. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors were suspended in 28 % 
      of the Centers. The survey shows what is considered as standard monitoring in 
      Italian Cardiac ICUs. Standard, routinely used monitoring consists of ECG, SpO2, 
      etCO2, invasive BP, CVP, diuresis, body temperature, and BGA. It also shows that 
      there is large variability among the various Centers regarding hemodynamic 
      monitoring of fluid therapy and inotropes administration. Further research is 
      required to better standardize and define the indicators to improve the standards of 
      intensive care after cardiac surgery among Italian cardiac ICUs.

PG  - 329-35
LID - 10.2345/0899-8205-50.5.329 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although electrocardiographic monitoring is valuable for continuous 
      surveillance of intensive care unit (ICU) patients, false alarms are common and have 
      been cited as a cause of alarm fatigue. ANSI/AAMI EC12:2002 states that 
      electrocardiograms (ECGs) should not detect a QRS if the waveform is less than 0.15 
      mV (1.5 mm) for adult patients, in order to avoid mislabeling P waves or baseline 
      noise as QRSs during complete heart block or asystole. However, ECG software 
      algorithms often use more conservative QRS thresholds, which may result in 
      false-positive asystole alarms in patients with low-amplitude QRS complexes. 
      OBJECTIVES: To 1) assess the frequency of low QRS amplitude in a group of ICU 
      patients with one or more false-positive asystole alarms and 2) determine whether 
      low-amplitude QRSs are associated with false-positive asystole alarms during 
      continuous ECG monitoring. METHODS: Hospital-acquired standard 12-lead ECGs were 
      examined in a group of 82 ICU patients who had one or more false-positive asystole 
      alarms. Low QRS amplitude was defined as a unidirectional (only positive or 
      negative) QRS of less than 5 mm in two of four leads (I, II, III, and V1). RESULTS: 
      Low-amplitude QRSs were present in 45 of 82 (55%) patients. The presence of 
      low-amplitude QRSs did not differ according to age, sex, or race. Patients treated 
      in the cardiac ICU had the highest proportion of low-amplitude QRSs. An equivalent 
      proportion of patients had false-positive asystole alarms by group (no low-amplitude 
      QRSs 95% vs. low-amplitude QRSs 87%; P = 0.229). Eight patients (10%) had both true- 
      and false-positive asystole alarms (two [5%] with no low-amplitude QRSs and six 
      [13%] with low-amplitude QRSs; P = 0.229). CONCLUSION: Low-amplitude QRS, as 
      assessed from hospital 12-lead ECGs, occurs frequently and is more common in cardiac 
      ICU patients. However, this ECG feature did not identify patients with 
      false-positive asystole alarms during continuous ECG monitoring.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the leading cause of death globally. 
      Electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis can provide thoroughly assessment for different 
      CVDs efficiently. We propose a multi-task group bidirectional long short-term memory 
      (MTGBi-LSTM) framework to intelligent recognize multiple CVDs based on multi-lead 
      ECG signals. METHODS: This model employs a Group Bi-LSTM (GBi-LSTM) and Residual 
      Group Convolutional Neural Network (Res-GCNN) to learn the dual feature 
      representation of ECG space and time series. GBi-LSTM is divided into Global Bi-LSTM 
      and Intra-Group Bi-LSTM, which can learn the features of each ECG lead and the 
      relationship between leads. Then, through attention mechanism, the different lead 
      information of ECG is integrated to make the model to possess the powerful feature 
      discriminability. Through multi-task learning, the model can fully mine the 
      association information between diseases and obtain more accurate diagnostic 
      results. In addition, we propose a dynamic weighted loss function to better quantify 
      the loss to overcome the imbalance between classes. RESULTS: Based on more than 
      170,000 clinical 12-lead ECG analysis, the MTGBi-LSTM method achieved accuracy, 
      precision, recall and F1 of 88.86%, 90.67%, 94.19% and 92.39%, respectively. The 
      experimental results show that the proposed MTGBi-LSTM method can reliably realize 
      ECG analysis and provide an effective tool for computer-aided diagnosis of CVD.

AB  - An elderly man was transferred to our emergency department with reported ventricular 
      tachycardia requiring intravenous amiodarone and intensive care unit admission. 
      Device interrogation, the following day, revealed only frequent premature 
      ventricular contractions and non-sustained ventricular tachycardia in a patient with 
      a known history of these conditions. The patient underwent unnecessary invasive 
      monitoring after being emergently transferred to our facility and admitted to the 
      intensive care unit. Fortunately, our patient did not suffer any unwarranted side 
      effects from intravenous amiodarone. This case reports on some negative consequences 
      of inappropriate intensive care unit admissions and how they could have been 
      avoided.

AB  - PURPOSE: To establish the radiation dose level for single- and dual-source thoracic 
      CT scans in daily practice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The dose levels delivered during 
      634 consecutive examinations over a period of 2 months were recorded. The CT scans 
      were performed using: (a) a standard protocol (single source, single energy [group 
      1]: n=266; dual source, single energy [group 2]: n=276; (b) with prospective ECG 
      synchronisation [group 3]: n=13; or (c) with dual energy [group 4]: n=79. All the 
      acquisitions included kilovoltage selection depending on the weight and automatic 
      milliamperage modulation. RESULTS: The mean DLP of the standard protocols was 97.12 
      mGycm (group 2; BMI=23.1kg/m(2)) and 211.1 mGycm (group 1; BMI=27.3kg/m(2)), the 
      choice of protocol depending on the diameter of the thorax relative to the diameter 
      of the field of the second source, and therefore on the patient's morphotype. When 
      imaging included examination of the proximal and middle coronary arteries (group 3), 
      the mean DLP was 105.5 mGycm. Morphological and functional imaging (group 4) was 
      obtained with a mean DLP of 404.3 mGycm. CONCLUSION: Depending on the objective of 
      the protocol, the mean DLP varied from 97.12 to 404.3 mGycm.

TI  - Heart rate recovery after exercise: a predictor of ventricular fibrillation 
      susceptibility after myocardial infarction.
PG  - H1763-9
AB  - Heart rate recovery after exercise, thought to be related to cardiac parasympathetic 
      tone, has been shown to be a prognostic tool for all-cause mortality. However, the 
      relationship between this variable and confirmed susceptibility to ventricular 
      fibrillation (VF) has not been established. Therefore, myocardial ischemia was 
      induced with a 2-min occlusion of the left circumflex artery during the last minute 
      of exercise in mongrel dogs with myocardial infarction (n = 105 dogs). VF was 
      induced in 66 animals (susceptible), whereas the remaining 39 dogs had no 
      arrhythmias (resistant). On a previous day, ECG was recorded and a time-series 
      analysis of heart rate variability was measured 30, 60, and 120 s after submaximal 
      exercise (treadmill running). The heart rate recovery was significantly greater in 
      resistant dogs than in susceptible dogs at all three times, with the most dramatic 
      difference at the 30-s mark (change from maximum: 48.1 +/- 3.6 beats/min, resistant 
      dogs; 31.0 +/- 2.2 beats/min, susceptible dogs). Correspondingly, indexes of 
      parasympathetic tone increased to a significantly greater extent in resistant dogs 
      at 30 and 60 s after exercise. These differences were eliminated by atropine 
      pretreatment. When considered together, these data suggest that resistant animals 
      exhibit a more rapid recovery of vagal activity after exercise than those 
      susceptible to VF. As such, postexercise heart rate recovery may help identify 
      patients with a high risk for VF following myocardial infarction.

TI  - Modelling and prediction for chaotic fir laser attractor using rational function 
      neural network.
PG  - 89-99
AB  - Many real-world systems such as irregular ECG signal, volatility of currency 
      exchange rate and heated fluid reaction exhibit highly complex nonlinear 
      characteristic known as chaos. These chaotic systems cannot be retreated 
      satisfactorily using linear system theory due to its high dimensionality and 
      irregularity. This research focuses on prediction and modelling of chaotic FIR (Far 
      InfraRed) laser system for which the underlying equations are not given. This paper 
      proposed a method for prediction and modelling a chaotic FIR laser time series using 
      rational function neural network. Three network architectures, TDNN (Time Delayed 
      Neural Network), RBF (radial basis function) network and the RF (rational function) 
      network, are also presented. Comparisons between these networks performance show the 
      improvements introduced by the RF network in terms of a decrement in network 
      complexity and better ability of predictability.

TI  - Non-linear complexity measures of heart rate variability in acute schizophrenia.
PG  - 2009-15
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Cardiovascular mortality is significantly increased in patients suffering 
      from schizophrenia. The mechanisms currently discussed contain unhealthy lifestyle 
      with obesity and smoking, increased incidence of diabetes, adverse pro-arrhythmic 
      effects of antipsychotic medication and altered autonomic function. It is therefore 
      likely that the adaptation of the heart rate to different requirements is faulty in 
      schizophrenia. One way to detect adaptive capabilities and thus stability of 
      regulation is to measure complexity of heart rate fluctuations, with more complex 
      heart rate fluctuations indicating better adaptability of the underlying system. 
      METHODS: We calculated novel non-linear measures for beat-to-beat interval 
      complexity from short-term ECG recordings in 20 unmedicated patients suffering from 
      acute schizophrenia and compared them to those obtained from matched controls. 
      RESULTS: Data from all mathematical models applied, i.e. joint symbolic dynamics, 
      compression entropy, fractal dimension and approximate entropy, revealed 
      significantly reduced complexity of heart rate time series in acute schizophrenia. 
      When using heart rate as a covariate, only fractal dimension remained significantly 
      altered, thus appearing to be a relatively more important heart rate independent 
      parameter. CONCLUSIONS: Complexity of heart rate modulation is significantly reduced 
      in acute, untreated schizophrenia, thus indicating an increased risk for 
      cardiovascular events in these patients. SIGNIFICANCE: These data might eventually 
      add to the currently discussed monitoring of physical health in patients with 
      schizophrenia, possibly providing a promising tool for cardio-arrhythmic risk 
      stratification.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: New aspects for automatic electrocardiography artifact 
      removal from surface electromyography signals by application of fractional order 
      calculus in combination with linear and nonlinear moving window filters are 
      explored. Surface electromyography recordings of skeletal trunk muscles are commonly 
      contaminated with spike shaped artifacts. This artifact originates from electrical 
      heart activity, recorded by electrocardiography, commonly present in the surface 
      electromyography signals recorded in heart proximity. For appropriate assessment of 
      neuromuscular changes by means of surface electromyography, application of a proper 
      filtering technique of electrocardiography artifact is crucial. METHODS: A novel 
      method for automatic artifact cancellation in surface electromyography signals by 
      applying fractional order calculus and nonlinear median filter is introduced. The 
      proposed method is compared with the linear moving average filter, with and without 
      prior application of fractional order calculus. 3D graphs for assessment of window 
      lengths of the filters, crest factors, root mean square differences, and fractional 
      calculus orders (called WFC and WRC graphs) have been introduced. For an appropriate 
      quantitative filtering evaluation, the synthetic electrocardiography signal and 
      analogous semi-synthetic dataset have been generated. The examples of noise removal 
      in 10 able-bodied subjects and in one patient with muscle dystrophy are presented 
      for qualitative analysis. RESULTS: The crest factors, correlation coefficients, and 
      root mean square differences of the recorded and semi-synthetic electromyography 
      datasets showed that the most successful method was the median filter in combination 
      with fractional order calculus of the order 0.9. Statistically more significant 
      (p < 0.001) ECG peak reduction was obtained by the median filter application 
      compared to the moving average filter in the cases of low level amplitude of muscle 
      contraction compared to ECG spikes. CONCLUSIONS: The presented results suggest that 
      the novel method combining a median filter and fractional order calculus can be used 
      for automatic filtering of electrocardiography artifacts in the surface 
      electromyography signal envelopes recorded in trunk muscles.

AB  - Premature ventricular contraction (PVC) is a common type of abnormal heartbeat. 
      Without early diagnosis and proper treatment, PVC may result in serious harms. 
      Diagnosis of PVC is of great importance in goal-directed treatment and preoperation 
      prognosis. This paper proposes a novel diagnostic method for PVC based on Lyapunov 
      exponents of electrocardiogram (ECG) beats. The methodology consists of 
      preprocessing, feature extraction and classification integrated into the system. PVC 
      beats can be classified and differentiated from other types of abnormal heartbeats 
      by analyzing Lyapunov exponents and training a learning vector quantization (LVQ) 
      neural network. Our algorithm can obtain a good diagnostic result with little 
      features by using single lead ECG data. The sensitivity, positive predictability, 
      and the overall accuracy of the automatic diagnosis of PVC is 90.26%, 92.31%, and 
      98.90%, respectively. The effectiveness of the new method is validated through 
      extensive tests using data from MIT-BIH database. The experimental results show that 
      the proposed method is efficient and robust.

AB  - To compare the performance of semi-automatic versus manual segmentation for 
      ECG-triggered cardiovascular computed tomography (CT) examinations prior to 
      transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), with focus on the speed and precision 
      of experienced versus inexperienced observers. The preoperative ECG-triggered CT 
      data of 30 consecutive patients who were scheduled for TAVR were included. All 
      datasets were separately evaluated by two radiologists with 1 and 5 years of 
      experience (novice and expert, respectively) in cardiovascular CT using an 
      evaluation software program with or without a semi-automatic TAVR workflow. The time 
      expended for data loading and all segmentation steps required for the implantation 
      planning were assessed. Inter-software as well as inter-observer reliability 
      analysis was performed. The CT datasets were successfully evaluated, with mean 
      duration between 520.4 ± 117.6 s and 693.2 ± 159.5 s. The three most time-consuming 
      steps were the 3D volume rendering, the measurement of aorta diameter and the sizing 
      of the aortic annulus. Using semi-automatic segmentation, a novice could evaluate CT 
      data approximately 12.3% faster than with manual segmentation, and an expert could 
      evaluate CT data approximately 10.3% faster [mean differences of 85.4 ± 83.8 s (p < 
      0.001) and 59.8 ± 101 s (p < 0.001), respectively]. The inter-software reliability 
      for a novice was slightly lower than for an expert; however, the reliability for a 
      novice and expert was excellent (ICC 0.92, 95% CI 0.75-0.97/ICC 0.96, 95% CI 
      0.91-0.98). Automatic aortic annulus detection failed in two patients (6.7%). The 
      study revealed excellent inter-software and inter-observer reliability, with a mean 
      ICC of 0.95. TAVR evaluation can be accomplished significantly faster with 
      semi-automatic rather than with manual segmentation, with comparable exactness, 
      showing a benefit for experienced and inexperienced observers.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: This study demonstrates deep learning approaches with an 
      aim to find the optimal method to automatically detect sleep apnea (SA) events from 
      an electrocardiogram (ECG) signal. METHODS: Six deep learning approaches were 
      designed and implemented for automatic detection of SA events including deep neural 
      network (DNN), one-dimensional (1D) convolutional neural networks (CNN), 
      two-dimensional (2D) CNN, recurrent neural networks (RNN), long short-term memory, 
      and gated-recurrent unit (GRU). Designed deep learning models were analyzed and 
      compared in the performances. The ECG signal was pre-processed, normalized, and 
      segmented into 10 s intervals. Subsequently, the signal was converted into a 2D form 
      for analysis in the 2D CNN model. A dataset collected from 86 patients with SA was 
      used. The training set comprised data from 69 of the patients, while the test set 
      contained data from the remaining 17 patients. RESULTS: The accuracy of the 
      best-performing model was 99.0%, and the 1D CNN and GRU models had 99.0% recall 
      rates. CONCLUSIONS: The designed deep learning approaches performed better than 
      those developed and tested in previous studies in terms of detecting SA events, and 
      they could distinguish between apnea and hypopnea events using an ECG signal. The 
      deep learning approaches such as 1D CNN and GRU can be helpful tools to 
      automatically detect SA in sleep apnea screening and related studies.

AB  - Actograms are well-established methods used for visualizing periodic activity of 
      animals in chronobiological research. They help in the understanding of the overall 
      characteristics of rhythms and are instrumental in defining the direction of 
      subsequent detailed analysis. Although there exists specialized software for 
      creating actograms, new users such as students and researchers from other fields 
      often find it inconvenient to use. In this study, we demonstrate a fast and easy 
      method to create actograms using Microsoft Excel. As operations in Excel are simple 
      and user-friendly, it takes only a few minutes to create an actogram. Using this 
      method, it is possible to obtain a visual understanding of the characteristics of 
      rhythms not only from typical activity data, but also from any kind of time-series 
      data such as body temperature, blood sugar level, gene expressions, sleep 
      electroencephalogram, heartbeat, and so on. The actogram thus created can also be 
      converted to the "heatogram" shown by color temperature. As opposed to conventional 
      chronograms, this new type of chronogram facilitates easy understanding of rhythmic 
      features in a more intuitive manner. This method is therefore convenient and 
      beneficial for a broad range of researchers including students as it aids in the 
      better understanding of periodic phenomena from a large amount of time-series data.

AB  - To investigate the image quality and the minimum required radiation dose for 
      automatic tube potential selection (ATPS) in dual-source computed tomography (DSCT) 
      coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA). Three hundred twenty-five 
      consecutive patients (153 men and 172 women) undergoing CCTA were assigned to either 
      the ATPS group (n = 172) or the control group (n = 153); the control group underwent 
      imaging at a constant current of 120 kV. All patients were scanned in either 
      prospectively ECG-triggered high-pitch helical mode or sequential mode. The 
      subjective image quality score, attenuation, image noise, signal-to-noise ratio 
      (SNR), contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), volume CT dose index (CTDIvol), and effective 
      dose (ED) were compared between the two groups with the Student t test or 
      Mann-Whitney U test. The subjective image quality score was not significantly 
      different between the two groups. Imaging noise and attenuation were both 
      significantly higher in the ATPS group than in the control group (imaging noise: 
      25.6 ± 7.6 versus 15.8 ± 4.0 HU, P < 0.001; attenuation: 559.6 ± 142.0 versus 
      412.5 ± 64.3 HU, P < 0.001). SNR and CNR were significantly lower in the ATPS group 
      than in the control group (SNR: 23.21 ± 7.40 versus 27.71 ± 8.25, P < 0.001; CNR: 
      27.81 ± 8.44 versus 33.94 ± 9.69, P < 0.001). ED was significantly lower in the ATPS 
      group than in the control group (ED: 1.25 ± 1.24 versus 2.19 ± 1.77 mSv, P < 0.001). 
      For both groups, ED was significantly lower in the high-pitch mode than in the 
      sequential mode. The use of ATPS for CCTA significantly reduced the radiation dose 
      while maintaining image quality.

AB  - The classification of electrocardiograms (ECG) plays an important role in the 
      clinical diagnosis of heart disease. This paper proposes an effective system 
      development and implementation for ECG classification based on faster regions with a 
      convolutional neural network (Faster R-CNN) algorithm. The original one-dimensional 
      ECG signals contain the preprocessed patient ECG signals and some ECG recordings 
      from the MIT-BIH database in this experiment. Each ECG beat of one-dimensional ECG 
      signals was transformed into a two-dimensional image for experimental training sets 
      and test sets. As a result, we classified the ECG beats into five categories with an 
      average accuracy of 99.21%. In addition, we did a comparative experiment using the 
      one versus rest support vector machine (OVR SVM) algorithm, and the classification 
      accuracy of the proposed Faster R-CNN was shown to be 2.59% higher.

TI  - Comparison of short-term heart rate variability indexes evaluated through 
      electrocardiographic and continuous blood pressure monitoring.
PG  - 1247-1263
LID - 10.1007/s11517-019-01957-4 [doi]
AB  - Heart rate variability (HRV) analysis represents an important tool for the 
      characterization of complex cardiovascular control. HRV indexes are usually 
      calculated from electrocardiographic (ECG) recordings after measuring the time 
      duration between consecutive R peaks, and this is considered the gold standard. An 
      alternative method consists of assessing the pulse rate variability (PRV) from 
      signals acquired through photoplethysmography, a technique also employed for the 
      continuous noninvasive monitoring of blood pressure. In this work, we carry out a 
      thorough analysis and comparison of short-term variability indexes computed from HRV 
      time series obtained from the ECG and from PRV time series obtained from continuous 
      blood pressure (CBP) signals, in order to evaluate the reliability of using 
      CBP-based recordings in place of standard ECG tracks. The analysis has been carried 
      out on short time series (300 beats) of HRV and PRV in 76 subjects studied in 
      different conditions: resting in the supine position, postural stress during 45° 
      head-up tilt, and mental stress during computation of arithmetic test. Nine 
      different indexes have been taken into account, computed in the time domain (mean, 
      variance, root mean square of the successive differences), frequency domain 
      (low-to-high frequency power ratio LF/HF, HF spectral power, and central frequency), 
      and information domain (entropy, conditional entropy, self entropy). Thorough 
      validation has been performed using comparison of the HRV and PRV distributions, 
      robust linear regression, and Bland-Altman plots. Results demonstrate the 
      feasibility of extracting HRV indexes from CBP-based data, showing an overall 
      relatively good agreement of time-, frequency-, and information-domain measures. The 
      agreement decreased during postural and mental arithmetic stress, especially with 
      regard to band-power ratio, conditional, and self-entropy. This finding suggests to 
      use caution in adopting PRV as a surrogate of HRV during stress conditions.

AB  - Cardiovascular diseases are the first cause of death in developed countries. Using 
      electrocardiographic (ECG), blood pressure (BP) and respiratory flow signals, we 
      obtained parameters for classifying cardiomyopathy patients. 42 patients with 
      ischemic (ICM) and dilated (DCM) cardiomyopathies were studied. The left ventricular 
      ejection fraction (LVEF) was used to stratify patients with low risk (LR: LVEF>35%, 
      14 patients) and high risk (HR: LVEF≤ 35%, 28 patients) of heart attack. RR, SBP and 
      TTot time series were extracted from the ECG, BP and respiratory flow signals, 
      respectively. The time series were transformed to a binary space and then analyzed 
      using Joint Symbolic Dynamic with a word length of three, characterizing them by the 
      probability of occurrence of the words. Extracted parameters were then reduced using 
      correlation and statistical analysis. Principal component analysis and support 
      vector machines methods were applied to characterize the cardiorespiratory and 
      cardiovascular interactions in ICM and DCM cardiomyopathies, obtaining an accuracy 
      of 85.7%.

PG  - 1503-6
AB  - Our study focuses on classifying as significant Electrocardiogram (ECG) data from 
      home healthcare system. Generally, spectral analysis of RR Interval (RRI) time 
      series is used to determine periodic component of Heart Rate Variability (HRV). It 
      is well known, moreover, that Low Frequency (LF) component is associated with blood 
      pressure regulation, and High Frequency (HF) component is referred to respiration as 
      Respiration Sinus Arrhythmia (RSA) in the HRV power spectra. In many cases, however, 
      LF and HF components may be entirely superimposed on each other and, therefore, the 
      method by division of power spectra range can not be evaluated diagnostically. We 
      propose another approach to interpret well better than before. The method which we 
      suggest is that it finds high correlative data using frequency analysis comparison 
      Heart Instantaneous Frequency (HIF) based on extracting the instantaneous 
      fundamental frequency with EDR. The reason which we use HIF is that it is simpler 
      and more powerful against noise than HRV. First of all, we show the EDR extraction 
      process, and then prove that HIF signal is useful or not through comparison with 
      HRV. Finally, we classify significant signal data through comparison High Frequency 
      (HF) component obtained frequency analysis of HIF with that of EDR.

TI  - Automatic slice alignment method for cardiac magnetic resonance imaging.
PG  - 451-61
LID - 10.1007/s10334-012-0361-4 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Automatic slice alignment is important for easier operation and shorter 
      examination times in cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations. We 
      propose a new automatic slice alignment method for six cardiac planes (short-axis, 
      vertical long-axis, horizontal long-axis, 4-chamber, 2-chamber, and 3-chamber 
      views). MATERIALS AND METHODS: ECG-gated 2D steady-state free precession axial 
      multislice images were acquired using a 1.5-T MRI scanner during a single 
      breath-hold. The scanning time was set to <20 s in 23 volumes from 23 healthy 
      volunteers. In this method, the positions of the mitral valve, cardiac apex, left 
      ventricular outflow tract, tricuspid valve, anterior wall of the heart, and right 
      ventricular corner are detected to determine the positions of six reference planes 
      by combining knowledge-based recognition and image processing techniques. In order 
      to evaluate the results of automatic slice alignment for the short-axis, 4-chamber, 
      2-chamber, and 3-chamber views, the angular and positional errors between the 
      results obtained by our proposed method and by manual annotation were measured. 
      RESULTS: The average angular errors for the short-axis, 4-chamber, 2-chamber, and 
      3-chamber views were 3.05°, 4.52°, 7.28°, and 5.79°, respectively. The average 
      positional errors for the short-axis (base), short-axis (apex), 4-chamber, 
      2-chamber, and 3-chamber views were 6.61°, 3.80°, 1.55°, 1.52°, and 1.48°, 
      respectively. CONCLUSION: The experimental results showed that our proposed method 
      can detect the cardiac planes quickly and accurately. Our method is therefore 
      beneficial to both patients and operators.

AB  - Cardiac arrhythmia or irregular heartbeats are an important feature to assess the 
      risk on sudden cardiac death and other cardiac disorders. Automatic classification 
      of irregular heartbeats is therefore an important part of ECG analysis. We propose a 
      tensor-based method for single- and multi-channel irregular heartbeat 
      classification. The method tensorizes the ECG data matrix by segmenting each signal 
      beat-by-beat and then stacking the result into a third-order tensor with dimensions 
      channel × time × heartbeat. We use the multilinear singular value decomposition to 
      model the obtained tensor. Next, we formulate the classification task as the 
      computation of a Kronecker Product Equation. We apply our method on the INCART 
      dataset, illustrating promising results.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: We describe the association of implementing a History, ECG, Age, 
      Risk Factors, and Troponin (HEART) care pathway on use of hospital care and 
      noninvasive stress testing, as well as 30-day patient outcomes in community 
      emergency departments (EDs). METHODS: We performed a prospective 
      interrupted-time-series study of adult encounters for patients evaluated for 
      suspected acute coronary syndrome. The primary outcome was hospitalization or 
      observation, noninvasive stress testing, or both within 30 days. The secondary 
      outcome was 30-day all-cause mortality or acute myocardial infarction. A generalized 
      estimating equation segmented logistic regression model was used to compare the odds 
      of the primary outcome before and after HEART implementation. All models were 
      adjusted for patient and facility characteristics and fit with physicians as a 
      clustering variable. RESULTS: A total of 65,393 ED encounters (before, 30,522; 
      after, 34,871) were included in the study. Overall, 33.5% (before, 35.5%; after, 
      31.8%) of ED chest pain encounters resulted in hospitalization or observation, 
      noninvasive stress testing, or both. Primary adjusted results found a significant 
      decrease in the primary outcome postimplementation (odds ratio 0.984; 95% confidence 
      interval [CI] 0.974 to 0.995). This resulted in an absolute adjusted month-to-month 
      decrease of 4.39% (95% CI 3.72% to 5.07%) after 12 months' follow-up, with a 
      continued trend downward. There was no difference in 30-day mortality or myocardial 
      infarction (0.6% [before] versus 0.6% [after]; odds ratio 1.02; 95% CI 0.97 to 
      1.08). CONCLUSION: Implementation of a HEART pathway in the ED evaluation of 
      patients with chest pain resulted in less inpatient care and noninvasive cardiac 
      testing and was safe. Using HEART to risk stratify chest pain patients can improve 
      the efficiency and quality of care.

TI  - Grid mapping: a novel method of signal quality evaluation on a single lead 
      electrocardiogram.
PG  - 895-907
LID - 10.1007/s13246-017-0594-7 [doi]
AB  - Diagnosis of long-term electrocardiogram (ECG) calls for automatic and accurate 
      methods of ECG signal quality estimation, not only to lighten the burden of the 
      doctors but also to avoid misdiagnoses. In this paper, a novel waveform-based method 
      of phase-space reconstruction for signal quality estimation on a single lead ECG was 
      proposed by projecting the amplitude of the ECG and its first order difference into 
      grid cells. The waveform of a single lead ECG was divided into non-overlapping 
      episodes (T(s) = 10, 20, 30 s), and the number of grids in both the width and the 
      height of each map are in the range [20, 100] (N(X) = N(Y) = 20, 30, 40, … 90, 100). 
      The blank pane ratio (BPR) and the entropy were calculated from the distribution of 
      ECG sampling points which were projected into the grid cells. Signal Quality Indices 
      (SQI) bSQI and eSQI were calculated according to the BPR and the entropy, 
      respectively. The MIT-BIH Noise Stress Test Database was used to test the 
      performance of bSQI and eSQI on ECG signal quality estimation. The signal-to-noise 
      ratio (SNR) during the noisy segments of the ECG records in the database is 24, 18, 
      12, 6, 0 and - 6 dB, respectively. For the SQI quantitative analysis, the records 
      were divided into three groups: good quality group (24, 18 dB), moderate group (12, 
      6 dB) and bad quality group (0, - 6 dB). The classification among good quality 
      group, moderate quality group and bad quality group were made by linear 
      support-vector machine with the combination of the BPR, the entropy, the bSQI and 
      the eSQI. The classification accuracy was 82.4% and the Cohen's Kappa coefficient 
      was 0.74 on a scale of N(X) = 40 and T(s) = 20 s. In conclusion, the novel grid 
      mapping offers an intuitive and simple approach to achieving signal quality 
      estimation on a single lead ECG.

TI  - Sports preparticipation cardiac screening: what about children?
PG  - 711-9
LID - 10.1007/s00431-013-2064-x [doi]
AB  - Sudden cardiac death in young athletes is a devastating event. Screening programs 
      have been proposed to prevent sudden cardiac death in young athletes. Mortality 
      rates and causes of death differ among young adults and children. Children have a 
      considerably lower incidence of sudden cardiac death. Data lack to compare athletes 
      and non-athletes in childhood, but 40-50 % of sudden cardiac death in this age group 
      seems to be related to exercise. Screening programs including history and physical 
      exam are not very sensitive or specific and will result in important numbers of 
      false-positives and false-negatives. Especially, interpretation of ECG in children 
      is different from ECG in adults, with less accurate diagnoses as a consequence. 
      Secondary prevention by widespread education of simple resuscitation techniques and 
      use of automatic external defibrillators if available will probably save as many 
      lives as any screening program. CONCLUSION: Sufficient data are lacking to support 
      general preparticipation screening with history, physical exam, and ECG in 
      competitive children. Nevertheless, the impact of such a program, together with 
      secondary preventive measures, should be evaluated in large prospective studies.

TI  - How accurate is pulse rate variability as an estimate of heart rate variability? A 
      review on studies comparing photoplethysmographic technology with an 
      electrocardiogram.
PG  - 15-29
LID - S0167-5273(12)00326-9 [pii]

AB  - BACKGROUND: The usefulness of heart rate variability (HRV) as a clinical research 
      and diagnostic tool has been verified in numerous studies. The gold standard 
      technique comprises analyzing time series of RR intervals from an 
      electrocardiographic signal. However, some authors have used pulse cycle intervals 
      instead of RR intervals, as they can be determined from a pulse wave (e.g. a 
      photoplethysmographic) signal. This option is often called pulse rate variability 
      (PRV), and utilizing it could expand the serviceability of pulse oximeters or 
      simplify ambulatory monitoring of HRV. METHODS: We review studies investigating the 
      accuracy of PRV as an estimate of HRV, regardless of the underlying technology 
      (photoplethysmography, continuous blood pressure monitoring or Finapresi, impedance 
      plethysmography). RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS: Results speak in favor of sufficient accuracy 
      when subjects are at rest, although many studies suggest that short-term variability 
      is somewhat overestimated by PRV, which reflects coupling effects between 
      respiration and the cardiovascular system. Physical activity and some mental 
      stressors seem to impair the agreement of PRV and HRV, often to an inacceptable 
      extent. Findings regarding the position of the sensor or the detection algorithm are 
      not conclusive. Generally, quantitative conclusions are impeded by the fact that 
      results of different studies are mostly incommensurable due to diverse experimental 
      settings and/or methods of analysis.

LID - 266
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although premature beats are a matter of concern in horses, the 
      interpretation of equine ECG recordings is complicated by a lack of standardized 
      analysis criteria and a limited knowledge of the normal beat-to-beat variation of 
      equine cardiac rhythm. The purpose of this study was to determine the appropriate 
      threshold levels of maximum acceptable deviation of RR intervals in equine ECG 
      analysis, and to evaluate a novel two-step timing algorithm by quantifying the 
      frequency of arrhythmias in a cohort of healthy adult endurance horses. RESULTS: 
      Beat-to-beat variation differed considerably with heart rate (HR), and an adaptable 
      model consisting of three different HR ranges with separate threshold levels of 
      maximum acceptable RR deviation was consequently defined. For resting HRs <60 
      beats/min (bpm) the threshold level of RR deviation was set at 20%, for HRs in the 
      intermediate range between 60 and 100 bpm the threshold was 10%, and for exercising 
      HRs >100 bpm, the threshold level was 4%. Supraventricular premature beats 
      represented the most prevalent arrhythmia category with varying frequencies in seven 
      horses at rest (median 7, range 2-86) and six horses during exercise (median 2, 
      range 1-24). CONCLUSIONS: Beat-to-beat variation of equine cardiac rhythm varies 
      according to HR, and threshold levels in equine ECG analysis should be adjusted 
      accordingly. Standardization of the analysis criteria will enable comparisons of 
      studies and follow-up examinations of patients. A small number of supraventricular 
      premature beats appears to be a normal finding in endurance horses. Further studies 
      are required to validate the findings and determine the clinical significance of 
      premature beats in horses.

AB  - Estimating the instantaneous respiratory rate (Rr) from the electrocardiogram (ECG) 
      is of interest as respiration direct measurement in clinical situations is often 
      cumbersome. In this study, the Rr was estimated from the same Final Directions of 
      maximum projection (FD) used for multi lead ECG automatic delineation. Power 
      spectral analysis over the directions based on QRS complex main peak and T wave 
      onset, peak and end spatial loops was used for Rr estimation. On a subset of the 
      Physionet MGH/MF dataset, the proposed method yielded more accurate Rr estimates 
      (minimum mean absolute error (MAE), 2.82 bpm) than the frequency tracking algorithm 
      (minimum MAE, 4.53 bpm) and Fourier-based frequency estimation (minimum MAE, 4.94 
      bpm) using each lead alone, outperforming also the weighted multi-signal 
      oscillator-based algorithm estimates for two or three lead (minimum MAE, 3.04 bpm). 
      It was also shown that the FD of the three orthogonalized leads from Principal 
      Component algorithm, improve the performance of Rr estimation.

TI  - Arrhythmia Classification Based on Multi-Domain Feature Extraction for an ECG 
      Recognition System.
LID - 1744
AB  - Automatic recognition of arrhythmias is particularly important in the diagnosis of 
      heart diseases. This study presents an electrocardiogram (ECG) recognition system 
      based on multi-domain feature extraction to classify ECG beats. An improved wavelet 
      threshold method for ECG signal pre-processing is applied to remove noise 
      interference. A novel multi-domain feature extraction method is proposed; this 
      method employs kernel-independent component analysis in nonlinear feature extraction 
      and uses discrete wavelet transform to extract frequency domain features. The 
      proposed system utilises a support vector machine classifier optimized with a 
      genetic algorithm to recognize different types of heartbeats. An ECG acquisition 
      experimental platform, in which ECG beats are collected as ECG data for 
      classification, is constructed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the system in ECG 
      beat classification. The presented system, when applied to the MIT-BIH arrhythmia 
      database, achieves a high classification accuracy of 98.8%. Experimental results 
      based on the ECG acquisition experimental platform show that the system obtains a 
      satisfactory classification accuracy of 97.3% and is able to classify ECG beats 
      efficiently for the automatic identification of cardiac arrhythmias.

TI  - Spectral analysis of heart period variance (HPV)--a tool to stratify risk following 
      myocardial infarction.
PG  - 248-56
AB  - The purpose of this study was to contribute to the improvement of stratification of 
      post-myocardial infarction patients at increased risk of malignant ventricular 
      arrhythmia (MVA). Power spectral analysis of heart period variability (HPV) was used 
      as a non-invasive tool to assess cardiac autonomic control. Three groups were used: 
      (1) post-myocardial infarction patients with MVA; (2) post-myocardial infarction 
      patients without MVA; and (3) a control group without heart disease. Spectral 
      analysis of HPV (AR model) was performed on four minute long RR-interval time series 
      derived from consecutive hours of Holter ECG. Significant decrease of powers of 
      mid-frequency (MF) (70-150 mHz) and high-frequency (HF) (150-450 mHz) spectral 
      components of HPV was obtained in Group 1 as compared to Group 2 (p = 0.001 and p = 
      0.02, respectively). There were no significant differences between groups concerning 
      the power of low frequency (LF) (10-70 mHz) component HPV, spectra of patients in 
      Group 1 were dominated by a single low frequency spectral peak (with a central 
      frequency of 37 mHz). The relative power was computed as the percentage of power in 
      each of the above (HF, MF, LF) components related to the total spectral power. 
      Highly significant differences (p = 0.04) were obtained between Group 1 and Group 2 
      concerning relative powers of MF and LF components as well as LF/MF ratio. The above 
      method appeared to be highly sensitive in differentiating patients with increased 
      risk of MVA.

TI  - Autonomic regulation during mild therapeutic hypothermia in cardiopulmonary 
      resuscitated patients.
PG  - 797-805
LID - 10.1007/s00392-011-0314-3 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether there are differences in autonomic cardiovascular 
      regulation in resuscitated patients undergoing therapeutic hypothermia (TH) in 
      relation to the clinical outcome. METHOD: Between 2005 and 2007, 18 consecutive 
      resuscitated patients were enrolled. ECG and blood pressure data were recorded for 
      48 h during hypothermia and warming up to a body core temperature of 36°C. Autonomic 
      regulation was assessed by applying time, frequency, and non-linear dynamics domain 
      methods from heart rate and blood pressure variability (HRV/BPV) analyses. RESULTS: 
      Nine patients survived with good neurological recovery, and nine patients died 
      during the ICU stay. In both groups, we found a decreased HRV presented by standard 
      deviation of R-R intervals (sdNN) below 50 ms(2) at each time of measurement. 
      Immediately after recovery to a body core temperature of 36°C, a significant higher 
      HRV was found in survivors compared to non-survivors by means of indices sdNN 
      (40.2 ± 19.5 vs. 10.9 ± 4.1 ms(2), P = 0.01), R-R intervals distribution histogram 
      [shannon] (3.7 ± 0.6 vs. 2.2 ± 0.4, P = 0.008), very low frequency band [VLF] 
      (152.2 ± 99.3 vs. 3.4 ± 1.9, P = 0.001) and the variance of the time series of R-R 
      intervals [Wsdvar] (1.16 ± 0.52 vs. 0.29 ± 0.25, P = 0.02) . A decreased spontaneous 
      BPV was found only among survivors comparing blood pressure characteristics within 
      stable hypothermia to the initial state before hypothermia. CONCLUSION: Resuscitated 
      patients show a significantly reduced HRV before, during and after TH. Compared to 
      survivors, the non-survivors show a further and significantly decrease of HRV 
      immediately after hypothermia.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the change of the amplitude of P wave, T wave and ST segment 
      of 12 lead electrocardiogram (ECG) in children with breath holding spell.  METHODS: 
      A total of 29 children (24 males and 5 females) with breath holding spell in Second 
      Xiangya Hospital, Central South University were enrolled for this study from 
      October, 2009 to September, 2015. Their ages ranged from 3 months to 6 years, with 
      an average of 1.82±1.27 years old. The control group consisted of 30 age-matched and 
      gender-matched healthy children. All subjects were underwent electrocardiography by 
      the SR-1000A comprehensive automatic electrocardiograph analyzer, and the changes of 
      the ECG parameters were compared between the two groups.  RESULTS: Compared with the 
      control group, the amplitude of P-wave of V5 lead was decreased [(44.10±23.98) vs 
      (58.30±21.19) μV, P<0.05], the amplitude of T-wave of V6 lead was increased 
      [(423.80±122.6) vs (350.00±105.73) μV, P<0.05], the amplitude of ST segment of II 
      lead was increased [(84.80±39.97) vs (57.30±38.77) μV, P<0.05], the amplitude of ST 
      segment of aVR lead was increased [(-77.60±37.41) vs (-51.00±33.46) μV, P<0.05], the 
      amplitude of ST segment of aVL lead was increased [(35.20±28.24) vs (17.70±33.90) 
      μV, P<0.05], the amplitude of ST segment of V5 lead was increased [(111.00±59.36) vs 
      (69.00±36.33) μV, P<0.05], the amplitude of ST segment of V6 lead was increased 
      [(79.30±45.51) vs (51.30±33.19) μV, P<0.05].   CONCLUSION: The children with breath 
      holding spell have autonomic nerve dysfunction. The amplitude of ST segment changes 
      is sensitive.

AB  - Accurate detection of cardiac pathological events is an important part of 
      electrocardiogram (ECG) evaluation and subsequent correct treatment of the patient. 
      The paper introduces the results of a complex study, where various aspects of 
      automatic classification of various heartbeat types have been addressed. 
      Particularly, non-ischemic, ischemic (of two different grades) and subsequent 
      ventricular premature beats were classified in this combination for the first time. 
      ECGs recorded in rabbit isolated hearts under non-ischemic and ischemic conditions 
      were used for analysis. Various morphological and spectral features (both commonly 
      used and newly proposed) as well as classification models were tested on the same 
      data set. It was found that: a) morphological features are generally more suitable 
      than spectral ones; b) successful results (accuracy up to 98.3% and 96.2% for 
      morphological and spectral features, respectively) can be achieved using features 
      calculated without time-consuming delineation of QRS-T segment; c) use of reduced 
      number of features (3 to 14 features) for model training allows achieving similar or 
      even better performance as compared to the whole feature sets (10 to 29 features); 
      d) k-nearest neighbours and support vector machine seem to be the most appropriate 
      models (accuracy up to 98.6% and 93.5%, respectively).

TI  - Trending autoregulatory indices during treatment for traumatic brain injury.
PG  - 821-831
AB  - Our goal is to use automatic data monitoring for reliable prediction of episodes of 
      intracranial hypertension in patients with traumatic brain injury. Here we test the 
      validity of our method on retrospective patient data. We developed the Continuous 
      Hemodynamic Autoregulatory Monitor (CHARM), that siphons and stores signals from 
      existing monitors in the surgical intensive care unit (SICU), efficiently compresses 
      them, and standardizes the search for statistical relationships between any proposed 
      index and adverse events. CHARM uses an automated event detector to reliably locate 
      episodes of elevated intracranial pressure (ICP), while eliminating artifacts within 
      retrospective patient data. A graphical user interface allowed data scanning, 
      selection of criteria for events, and calculating indices. The pressure reactivity 
      index (PRx), defined as the least square linear regression slope of intracranial 
      pressure versus arterial BP, was calculated for a single case that spanned 259 h. 
      CHARM collected continuous records of ABP, ICP, ECG, SpO2, and ventilation from 29 
      patients with TBI over an 18-month period. Analysis of a single patient showed that 
      PRx data distribution in the single hours immediately prior to all 16 intracranial 
      hypertensive events, significantly differed from that in the 243 h that did not 
      precede such events (p < 0.0001). The PRx index, however, lacked sufficient 
      resolution as a real-time predictor of IH in this patient. CHARM streamlines the 
      search for reliable predictors of intracranial hypertension. We report statistical 
      evidence supporting the predictive potential of the pressure reactivity index.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: Non-convulsive seizures/status epilepticus occur in approximately 
      20% of comatose, non-cardiac arrest intensive care unit (ICU) patients, and are 
      associated with increased mortality. The prevalence and clinical significance of 
      seizures in comatose survivors of cardiac arrest undergoing therapeutic hypothermia 
      is not well described. METHODS: At this urban level I trauma center, every patient 
      undergoing therapeutic hypothermia is monitored with continuous video 
      encephalography (cvEEG). We abstracted medical records for all cardiac arrest 
      patients treated with therapeutic hypothermia during 2010. Clinical data were 
      extracted in duplicate. cvEEGs were independently reviewed for seizures by two 
      board-certified epileptologists. RESULTS: There were 33 patients treated with 
      therapeutic hypothermia after cardiac arrest in 2010 who met inclusion criteria for 
      this study. Median age was 58 (range 28-86 years), 63% were white, 55% were male, 
      and 9% had a history of seizures or epilepsy. During cooling, seizures occurred in 
      5/33 patients (15%, 95%CI 6%-33%). 11/33 patients (33%, 95% CI 19%-52%) had seizures 
      at some time during hospitalization. 13/33 (39%) survived to discharge and of these, 
      7/13 (54%) survived to 30 days. 9/11 patients with seizures died during 
      hospitalization, compared with 11/22 patients without seizures (82% vs. 50%; 
      difference 32%, CI 951%-63%). No patient with seizures was alive at 30 days. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Seizures are common in comatose patients treated with therapeutic 
      hypothermia after cardiac arrest. All patients with seizures were deceased within 30 
      days of discharge. Routine use of EEG monitoring could assist in early detection of 
      seizures in this patient population, providing an opportunity for intervention to 
      potentially improve outcomes.

TI  - Linear and non-linear analysis of the surface electrocardiogram during human 
      ventricular fibrillation shows evidence of order in the underlying mechanism.
PG  - 354-8
AB  - Ventricular fibrillation (VF) is a poorly understood yet potentially lethal cardiac 
      arrhythmia. The electrocardiogram (ECG) time series of VF is investigated by 
      comparison of the linear and non-linear features of VF time series and surrogates in 
      which internal correlations have been destroyed. From 40 ECG time series of human VF 
      and 40 surrogate time series, three quantities are evaluated: the percentage of the 
      linear time-frequency distribution (TFD) exceeding a threshold, the non-linear 
      coarse-grained correlation dimension (Dcg), and the percentage of diagonal lines in 
      the non-linear recurrence plot longer than 10 elements (D10). It is found that the 
      mean (SD) percent threshold TFD and Dcg are higher for the surrogates (6.7% (1.3) 
      and 5.3 (0.6)) than the VF time series (5.6% (0.7) and 3.8 (0.9)), whereas the mean 
      D10 is higher for the VF time series (49% (13)) than the surrogates (32% (7)). All 
      of these differences are significant (p < 0.0001) and indicate greater order in the 
      VF time series than in the surrogates. It is therefore shown that both linear and 
      non-linear signal analysis demonstrate order in the ECG time series of VF.

TI  - Selvester scoring in patients with strict LBBB using the QUARESS software.
PG  - 763-8
LID - S0022-0736(15)00184-3 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jelectrocard.2015.06.003 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Estimation of the infarct size from body-surface ECGs in post-myocardial 
      infarction patients has become possible using the Selvester scoring method. 
      Automation of this scoring has been proposed in order to speed-up the measurement of 
      the score and improving the inter-observer variability in computing a score that 
      requires strong expertise in electrocardiography. In this work, we evaluated the 
      quality of the QuAReSS software for delivering correct Selvester scoring in a set of 
      standard 12-lead ECGs. METHOD: Standard 12-lead ECGs were recorded in 105 post-MI 
      patients prescribed implantation of an implantable cardiodefibrillator (ICD). 
      Amongst the 105 patients with standard clinical left bundle branch block (LBBB) 
      patterns, 67 had a LBBB pattern meeting the strict criteria. The QuAReSS software 
      was applied to these 67 tracings by two independent groups of cardiologists (from a 
      clinical group and an ECG core laboratory) to measure the Selvester score 
      semi-automatically. Using various level of agreement metrics, we compared the scores 
      between groups and when automatically measured by the software. RESULTS: The average 
      of the absolute difference in Selvester scores measured by the two independent 
      groups was 1.4±1.5 score points, whereas the difference between automatic method and 
      the two manual adjudications were 1.2±1.2 and 1.3±1.2 points. Eighty-two percent 
      score agreement was observed between the two independent measurements when the 
      difference of score was within two point ranges, while 90% and 84% score agreements 
      were reached using the automatic method compared to the two manual adjudications. 
      CONCLUSION: The study confirms that the QuAReSS software provides valid measurements 
      of the Selvester score in patients with strict LBBB with minimal correction from 
      cardiologists.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Wearable devices with photoplethysmography (PPG) technology can be 
      useful for detecting paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF), which often goes 
      uncaptured despite being a leading cause of stroke. OBJECTIVE: This study is the 
      first part of a 2-phase study that aimed at developing a method for immediate 
      detection of paroxysmal AF using PPG-integrated wearable devices. In this study, the 
      diagnostic performance of 2 major smart watches, Apple Watch Series 3 and Fitbit 
      (FBT) Charge HR Wireless Activity Wristband, each equipped with a PPG sensor, was 
      compared, and the pulse rate data outputted from those devices were analyzed for 
      precision and accuracy in reference to the heart rate data from electrocardiography 
      (ECG) during AF. METHODS: A total of 40 subjects from patients who underwent cardiac 
      surgery at a single center between September 2017 and March 2018 were monitored for 
      postoperative AF using telemetric ECG and PPG devices. AF was diagnosed using a 
      12-lead ECG by qualified physicians. Each subject was given a pair of smart watches, 
      Apple Watch and FBT, for simultaneous pulse rate monitoring. The heart rate of all 
      subjects was also recorded on the telemetry system. Time series pulse rate trends 
      and heart rate trends were created and analyzed for trend pattern similarities. 
      Those trend data were then used to determine the accuracy of PPG-based pulse rate 
      measurements in reference to ECG-based heart rate measurements during AF. RESULTS: 
      Of the 20 AF events in group FBT, 6 (30%) showed a moderate or higher correlation 
      (cross-correlation function>0.40) between pulse rate trend patterns and heart rate 
      trend patterns. Of the 16 AF events in group Apple Watch (workout [W] mode), 12 
      (75%) showed a moderate or higher correlation between the 2 trend patterns. Linear 
      regression analyses also showed a significant correlation between the pulse rates 
      and the heart rates during AF in the subjects with Apple Watch. This correlation was 
      not observed with FBT. The regression formula for Apple Watch W mode and FBT was 
      X=14.203 + 0.841Y and X=58.225 + 0.228Y, respectively (where X denotes the mean of 
      all average pulse rates during AF and Y denotes the mean of all corresponding 
      average heart rates during AF), and the coefficient of determination (R(2)) was 
      0.685 and 0.057, respectively (P<.001 and .29, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: In this 
      validation study, the detection precision of AF and measurement accuracy during AF 
      were both better with Apple Watch W mode than with FBT.

TI  - Accuracy of EASI 12-lead ECGs in monitoring ST-segment and J-point by nurses in the 
      Coronary Care Units.
PG  - 1282-91
LID - 10.1111/jocn.13168 [doi]
AB  - AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To confirm the accuracy of the EASI system compared to the 
      standard 12-lead electrocardiogram, which is the gold standard, in monitoring the 
      two major parameters used in the Coronary Care Units to detect myocardial ischaemia: 
      ST-segment and J-point. BACKGROUND: Continuous electrocardiograph monitoring is used 
      in the Coronary Care Units to detect cardiac conduction abnormalities and to show 
      the morphology of electrocardiographic waves and tracts. Its accuracy is essential 
      for efficient nursing vigilance, particularly for monitoring the ST segment and the 
      J-point, in which alterations may indicate the onset of myocardial ischaemia. 
      DESIGN: An observational study was conducted. METHODS: The enrolled patients (n = 
      253) simultaneously underwent standard electrocardiogram (10 electrodes) and EASI 
      electrocardiogram (five electrodes). Data were collected by the Coronary Care Units 
      nurses. Tests to compare differences in means and medians between the two sets of 
      measurements were performed, and the Bland-Altman plots were used to illustrate 
      their agreement. RESULTS: All 6·072 electrocardiographic leads (3·036 standard and 
      3·036 EASI) were recorded and analysed. Between the two measurement methods, very 
      small statistically significant differences were found in some leads which are not 
      clinically relevant for both the ST-segment or the J-point. CONCLUSIONS: This study 
      confirms that the accuracy of the EASI 12-leadelectrocardiogram, compared to the 
      standard 12-leadelectrocardiogram, which is the gold standard, is acceptable for 
      clinical practice to monitor the two major parameters used in the Coronary Care 
      Units for detecting myocardial ischaemia: ST-segment and J-point. RELEVANCE TO 
      CLINICAL PRACTICE: The EASI system ensures: (1) ease of use and comfort for patients 
      admitted to Coronary Care Units because it only requires five electrodes; (2) 
      increased efficacy of nursing vigilance in the early detection of changes in 
      ST-segment and J- point measurements.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: For diagnosis of arrhythmic heart problems, 
      electrocardiogram (ECG) signals should be recorded and monitored. The long-term 
      signal records obtained are analyzed by expert cardiologists. Devices such as the 
      Holter monitor have limited hardware capabilities. For improved diagnostic capacity, 
      it would be helpful to detect arrhythmic signals automatically. In this study, a 
      novel approach is presented as a candidate solution for these issues. METHODS: A 
      convolutional auto-encoder (CAE) based nonlinear compression structure is 
      implemented to reduce the signal size of arrhythmic beats. Long-short term memory 
      (LSTM) classifiers are employed to automatically recognize arrhythmias using ECG 
      features, which are deeply coded with the CAE network. RESULTS: Based upon the coded 
      ECG signals, both storage requirement and classification time were considerably 
      reduced. In experimental studies conducted with the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database, ECG 
      signals were compressed by an average 0.70% percentage root mean square difference 
      (PRD) rate, and an accuracy of over 99.0% was observed. CONCLUSIONS: One of the 
      significant contributions of this study is that the proposed approach can 
      significantly reduce time duration when using LSTM networks for data analysis. Thus, 
      a novel and effective approach was proposed for both ECG signal compression, and 
      their high-performance automatic recognition, with very low computational cost.

AB  - Classifying arrhythmias can be a tough task for a human being and automating this 
      task is highly desirable. Nevertheless fully automatic arrhythmia classification 
      through Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals is a challenging task when the inter-patient 
      paradigm is considered. For the inter-patient paradigm, classifiers are evaluated on 
      signals of unknown subjects, resembling the real world scenario. In this work, we 
      explore a novel ECG representation based on vectorcardiogram (VCG), called temporal 
      vectorcardiogram (TVCG), along with a complex network for feature extraction. We 
      also fine-tune the SVM classifier and perform feature selection with a particle 
      swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. Results for the inter-patient paradigm show that 
      the proposed method achieves the results comparable to state-of-the-art in MIT-BIH 
      database (53% of Positive predictive (+P) for the Supraventricular ectopic beat (S) 
      class and 87.3% of Sensitivity (Se) for the Ventricular ectopic beat (V) class) that 
      TVCG is a richer representation of the heartbeat and that it could be useful for 
      problems involving the cardiac signal and pattern recognition.

LID - 10.1038/s41372-018-0089-8 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE(S): In well-appearing newborns with suspected cardiac ectopy, we sought to 
      evaluate our practice and test whether initial electrocardiogram (ECG) findings were 
      associated with neonatal arrhythmias (NA). STUDY DESIGN: We identified 
      well-appearing, non-anomalous infants >34 weeks' gestation with suspected ectopy 
      over 3.5 years. NA was defined as ≥10% premature atrial contractions (PAC), ≥5 beats 
      of atrial tachycardia, ≥2% premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), or ≥3 beats of 
      ventricular tachycardia. The unadjusted associations between initial ECG findings 
      and NA are reported. RESULT: Among 126 infants with ECGs and Holters performed, NA 
      was observed in 38 patients (30%) and was similar whether PACs were present or not 
      on the initial ECG (33% vs. no PACs: 29%, p = 0.6). However, NAs were identified 
      more frequently based on the presence of PVCs on the initial ECG (83% vs. 25%, 
      p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: NAs were prevalent and both their etiologies and impact on 
      infants warrant future study.

TI  - Circadian variations of sinus rate in subjects with sinus node dysfunction.
PG  - 173-83
AB  - Circadian variations of sinus rate (SR) are well described in subjects with normal 
      sinus node (SN). On the other hand there are no data in literature concerning the SR 
      daily variations in patients with SN dysfunction. In order to clarify this problem 
      we studied the SR circadian variation in healthy subjects (12) and in patients with 
      intermittent bradycardia (11), persistent bradycardia (9) and intermittent 2:1 
      sino-atrial block (7). Sr was recorded utilizing ECG Holter monitoring. By 
      histograms obtained every 2 h, maximum, modal, and minimum SR were evaluated. Time 
      series were analyzed with a computer program for cosinor method. In the patients 
      with normal SN, circadian periodicity in SR was confirmed with acrophase at 16(26) 
      (Maximum SR), 16(38) (minimum SR) and 16(31) (SR mode), respectively. In patients 
      with intermittent bradycardia a circadian rhythm was detected only in minimum SR 
      (Acrophase: 16(51)) and in SR mode (acrophase: 16(13)). No statistically significant 
      circadian variations of the 3 parameters of SR were observed in patients with both 
      persistent bradycardia and sino-atrial block. These data suggest that: 1. the 
      disappearance of the circadian periodicity is proportional to the severity of SN 
      dysfunction; 2. the patients with intermittent bradycardia show a more normal 
      behavior at low rates than at high ones; 3. the disappearance of circadian rhythm in 
      patients with marked SN dysfunction can be related to the SN intrinsic involvement 
      and/or autonomic nervous system dysfunction.

TI  - Accuracy of the StressEraser in the detection of cardiac rhythms.
PG  - 83-9
LID - 10.1007/s10484-008-9054-1 [doi]
AB  - StressEraser is a commercially marketed biofeedback device designed to enhance heart 
      rate variability. StressEraser makes its internal calculations on beat-to-beat 
      measures of finger pulse intervals. However, the accuracy and precision of 
      StressEraser in quantifying interbeat intervals using finger pulse intervals has not 
      been evaluated against standard laboratory equipment using R-R intervals. Accuracy 
      was assessed by simultaneously recording interbeat intervals using StressEraser and 
      a standard laboratory ECG system. The interbeat intervals were highly correlated 
      between the systems. The average deviation in interbeat interval recordings between 
      the systems was approximately 6 ms. Moreover, correlations approached unity between 
      the systems on estimates of heart period, heart rate, and heart rate variability. 
      Feedback from StressEraser is based on an interbeat time series that provides 
      sufficient information to provide an excellent estimate of the dynamic changes in 
      heart rate and heart rate variability. The slight variations between StressEraser 
      and the laboratory equipment in quantifying heart rate and heart rate variability 
      are due to features related to monitoring heart rate with finger pulse: (1) a lack 
      in precision in the peak of the finger pulse relative to the clearly defined 
      inflection point in the R-wave, and (2) contribution of variations in pulse transit 
      time.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Heart rate is the most important indicator of infant well-being during 
      neonatal resuscitation. The Nellcor Pedi-Cap turns gold when exposed to exhaled gas 
      with CO₂>15 mmHg. The aim of this study was to determine if Pedi-Cap gold color 
      change during neonatal resuscitation precedes an increase in heart rate in babies 
      with bradycardia receiving mask ventilation. METHODS: This was a single-center 
      retrospective review of video recordings and physiologic data of newborns with 
      bradycardia receiving mask positive pressure ventilation during neonatal 
      resuscitation. Subjects were included if the baby's HR<100 BPM within the first 90 s 
      of resuscitation. The primary outcome was the change in HR prior to Pedi-Cap gold 
      color change compared to the HR after Pedi-Cap gold color change. RESULTS: Forty-one 
      newborns during the study period had HR<100 BPM and received mask positive pressure 
      ventilation with a Pedi-Cap. The median heart rate 10s prior to Pedi-Cap gold color 
      change was 75 BPM (IQR 62-85) and increased to 136 BPM (IQR 113-158) 30 s after gold 
      color change (p<0.001). SpO₂ increased from 45 ± 17% prior to Pedi-Cap gold color 
      change to 52 ± 17% 30s after gold color change (p=0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Colorimetric 
      CO₂ detection during mask positive pressure ventilation in neonatal resuscitation 
      precedes a significant increase in heart rate and SpO₂. The Pedi-Cap can be easily 
      applied during resuscitation, requires no electricity, provides immediate feedback 
      and may be a useful, simple tool early in resuscitation and may be especially useful 
      in resource limited settings.

LID - e0175087
AB  - BACKGROUND: Increased variability of beat-to-beat QT-interval durations on the 
      electrocardiogram (ECG) has been associated with increased risk for fatal and 
      non-fatal cardiac events. However, techniques for the measurement of QT variability 
      (QTV) have not been validated since a gold standard is not available. In this study, 
      we propose a validation method and illustrate its use for the validation of two 
      automatic QTV measurement techniques. METHODS: Our method generates artificial 
      standard 12-lead ECGs based on the averaged P-QRS-T complexes from a variety of 
      existing ECG signals, with simulated intrinsic (QT interval) and extrinsic (noise, 
      baseline wander, signal length) variations. We quantified QTV by a commonly used 
      measure, short-term QT variability (STV). Using 28,800 simulated ECGs, we assessed 
      the performance of a conventional QTV measurement algorithm, resembling a manual QTV 
      measurement approach, and a more advanced algorithm based on fiducial segment 
      averaging (FSA). RESULTS: The results for the conventional algorithm show 
      considerable median absolute differences between the simulated and estimated STV. 
      For the highest noise level, median differences were 4-6 ms in the absence of QTV. 
      Increasing signal length generally yields more accurate STV estimates, but the 
      difference in performance between 30 or 60 beats is small. The FSA algorithm proved 
      to be very accurate, with most median absolute differences less than 0.5 ms, even 
      for the highest levels of disturbance. CONCLUSIONS: Artificially constructed ECGs 
      with a variety of disturbances allow validation of QTV measurement procedures. The 
      FSA algorithm provides highly accurate STV estimates under varying signal 
      conditions, and performs much better than traditional beat-by-beat analysis. The 
      fully automatic operation of the FSA algorithm enables STV measurement in large sets 
      of ECGs.

TI  - 3-D reconstruction of the coronary artery tree from multiple views of a rotational 
      X-ray angiography.
PG  - 733-49
LID - 10.1007/s10554-009-9528-0 [doi]
AB  - To present an efficient and robust method for 3-D reconstruction of the coronary 
      artery tree from multiple ECG-gated views of an X-ray angiography. 2-D coronary 
      artery centerlines are extracted automatically from X-ray projection images using an 
      enhanced multi-scale analysis. For the difficult data with low vessel contrast, a 
      semi-automatic tool based on fast marching method is implemented to allow manual 
      correction of automatically-extracted 2-D centerlines. First, we formulate the 3-D 
      symbolic reconstruction of coronary arteries from multiple views as an energy 
      minimization problem incorporating a soft epipolar line constraint and a smoothness 
      term evaluated in 3-D. The proposed formulation results in the robustness of the 
      reconstruction to the imperfectness in 2-D centerline extraction, as well as the 
      reconstructed coronary artery tree being inherently smooth in 3-D. We further 
      propose to solve the energy minimization problem using α-expansion moves of Graph 
      Cuts, a powerful optimization technique that yields a local minimum in a strong 
      sense at a relatively low computational complexity. We show experimental results on 
      a synthetic coronary phantom, a porcine data set and 11 patient data sets. For the 
      coronary phantom, results obtained using different number of views are presented. 
      3-D reconstruction error evaluated by the mean plus one standard deviation is below 
      one millimeter when 4 or more views are used. For real data, reconstruction using 4 
      to 5 views and 256 depth labels averaged around 12 s on a computer with 2.13 GHz 
      Intel Pentium M and achieves a mean 2-D back-projection error of 1.18 mm (ranging 
      from 0.84 to 1.71 mm) in 12 cases. The accuracy for multi-view reconstruction of the 
      coronary artery tree as reported from the phantom and patient studies is promising, 
      and the efficiency is significantly improved compared to other approaches reported 
      in the literature, which range from a few to tens of minutes. Visually good and 
      smooth reconstruction is demonstrated.

TI  - Implementing Practice Standards for Inpatient Electrocardiographic Monitoring.
PG  - 109-116
LID - 10.4037/ajcc2019699 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although electrocardiographic monitoring is common in hospitalized 
      patients, many patients receive unnecessary monitoring, contributing to patients' 
      inconvenience, clinicians' alarm fatigue, and delayed admissions. OBJECTIVE: To 
      evaluate the impact of implementation of an electronic order set based on the 
      American Heart Association practice standards for electrocardiographic monitoring on 
      the occurrence of appropriate monitoring. METHODS: The sample for this 
      preintervention-to-postintervention quasi-experimental study consisted of 297 adult 
      patients on medical, surgical, neurological, oncological, and orthopedic patient 
      care units that used remote electrocardiographic monitoring in a 627-bed hospital in 
      Minneapolis, Minnesota. The intervention was the introduction into the electronic 
      health record of order sets prompting physicians to order electrocardiographic 
      monitoring per the American Heart Association practice standards. Indications for 
      monitoring according to the practice standards and adverse outcomes (unexpected 
      transfer to intensive care unit, death, code blue events, and call for the rapid 
      response team) were compared before and after implementation of the order set. 
      RESULTS: Implementation of the order set was associated with an increase in 
      appropriate monitoring (48.0% to 61.2%; P = .03); the largest increase was in 
      ordering by medical residents (30.8% to 76.5%; P = .001). No significant increase in 
      adverse patient outcomes was noted. CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of the practice 
      standards via an electronic order set was associated with a statistically 
      significant increase in appropriate monitoring, with no increase in adverse events.

AB  - The Linköping burn score has been used for two decades to calculate the cost to the 
      hospital of each burned patient. Our aim was to validate the Burn Score in a 
      dedicated Burn Centre by analysing the associations with burn-specific factors: 
      percentage of total body surface area burned (TBSA%), cause of injury, patients 
      referred from other (non-specialist) centres, and survival, to find out which of 
      these factors resulted in higher scores. Our second aim was to analyse the variation 
      in scores of each category of care (surveillance, respiration, circulation, wound 
      care, mobilisation, laboratory tests, infusions, and operation). We made a 
      retrospective analysis of all burned patients admitted during the period 2000-15. 
      Multivariable regression models were used to analyse predictive factors for an 
      increased daily burn score, the cumulative burn score (the sum of the daily burn 
      scores for each patient) and the total burn score (total sum of burn scores for the 
      whole group throughout the study period) in addition to sub-analysis of the 
      different categories of care that make up the burn score. We retrieved 22301 daily 
      recordings for inpatients. Mobilisation and care of the wound accounted for more 
      than half of the total burn score during the study. Increased TBSA% and age over 45 
      years were associated with increased cumulative (model R(2) 0.43, p<0.001) and daily 
      (model R(2) 0.61, p<0.001) burn scores. Patients who died had higher daily burn 
      scores, while the cumulative burn score decreased with shorter duration of hospital 
      stay (p<0.001). To our knowledge this is the first long term analysis and validation 
      of a system for scoring burn interventions in patients with burns that explores its 
      association with the factors important for outcome. Calculations of costs are based 
      on the score, and it provides an indicator of the nurses' workload. It also gives 
      important information about the different dimensions of the care provided from 
      thorough investigation of the scores for each category.

AB  - Ambulatory cardiac monitoring is a rapidly expanding field and one that is likely to 
      progress beyond electrocardiographic (ECG) and blood pressure recordings. To date, 
      the primary cardiac monitoring focus has been ambulatory ECG (AECG) monitoring. In 
      this setting, AECG monitoring has become a diagnostic tool used daily by physicians 
      of many specialties. In this regard, both wearable and subcutaneous ECG monitoring 
      technologies are now widely available, with the appropriate choice for a given 
      patient being best determined by the frequency with which the patient's symptom 
      recurrences are expected. In other words, the less frequent the symptomatic events, 
      then the longer the monitoring duration requirement should be. However, multiple 
      factors other than the technology used impact success. For example, wearable AECG 
      systems are only capable of monitoring patients for a period of a few days to 
      several weeks due to limited battery longevity, patient intolerance to cutaneous ECG 
      electrodes, the cumbersome nature of the device, or a combination of these factors. 
      Current-generation insertable cardiac monitors (ICMs), on the other hand, offer 
      three years of monitoring and infrequent skin irritation. Additionally, automatic 
      remote download, a valuable feature in many cases, is only offered by certain 
      wearable technologies, but is an option in all currently available ICMs. This report 
      focuses on the current status of subcutaneous ICMs and their indications and 
      limitations. The goal is to highlight the variety of utility of current ICM 
      technologies and to provide insight into potential future subcutaneous ICM 
      applications.

TI  - Effectiveness of systematic screening for the detection of atrial fibrillation.
PG  - CD009586
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD009586.pub2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia in clinical 
      practice and is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Screening for AF in 
      asymptomatic patients has been proposed as a way of reducing the burden of the 
      disease by detecting people who would benefit from prophylactic anticoagulation 
      therapy prior to the onset of symptoms. However, for screening to be an effective 
      intervention it must improve the detection of AF and provide benefit for those who 
      are detected earlier as a result of screening. OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of 
      this review was to examine whether screening programmes increase the detection of 
      new cases of AF compared to routine practice. The secondary objectives were to 
      identify which combination of screening strategy and patient population is most 
      effective, as well as assessing any safety issues associated with screening, its 
      acceptability within the target population and the costs involved. SEARCH METHODS: 
      We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) on The 
      Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (Ovid) and EMBASE (Ovid) up to March 2012. Other relevant 
      research databases, trials registries and websites were searched up to June 2012. 
      Reference lists of identified studies were also searched for potentially relevant 
      studies and we contacted corresponding authors for information about additional 
      published or unpublished studies that may be relevant. No language restrictions were 
      applied. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials, controlled before and 
      after studies and interrupted time series studies comparing screening for AF with 
      routine practice in people aged 40 years and over were eligible. Two authors (PM, CT 
      or MF) independently selected the trials for inclusion. DATA COLLECTION AND 
      ANALYSIS: Assessment of risk of bias and data extraction were performed 
      independently by two authors (PM, CT). Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals 
      (CI) were used to present the results for the primary outcome, which is a 
      dichotomous variable. Since only one included study was identified, no meta-analysis 
      was performed. MAIN RESULTS: One cluster randomised controlled trial met the 
      inclusion criteria for this review. This study compared systematic screening (by 
      invitation to have an electrocardiogram (ECG)) and opportunistic screening (pulse 
      palpation during a general practitioner (GP) consultation for any reason followed by 
      an ECG if pulse was irregular) to routine practice (normal case finding on the basis 
      of clinical presentation) in people aged 65 years or older. The risk of bias in the 
      included study was judged to be low.Both systematic and opportunistic screening of 
      people over the age of 65 years are more effective than routine practice (OR 1.57, 
      95% CI 1.08 to 2.26 and OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.10 to 2.29, respectively). The number 
      needed to screen in order to detect one additional case compared to routine practice 
      was 172 (95% CI 94 to 927) for systematic screening and 167 (95% CI 92 to 806) for 
      opportunistic screening. Both systematic and opportunistic screening were more 
      effective in men (OR 2.68, 95% CI 1.51 to 4.76 and OR 2.33, 95% CI 1.29 to 4.19, 
      respectively) than in women (OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.62 and OR 1.2, 95% CI 0.74 to 
      1.93, respectively). No data on the effectiveness of screening in different ethnic 
      or socioeconomic groups were available. There were insufficient data to compare the 
      effectiveness of screening programmes in different healthcare settings.Systematic 
      screening was associated with a better overall uptake rate than opportunistic 
      screening (53% versus 46%) except in the ≥ 75 years age group where uptake rates 
      were similar (43% versus 42%). In both screening programmes men were more likely to 
      participate than women (57% versus 50% in systematic screening, 49% versus 41% in 
      opportunistic screening) and younger people (65 to 74 years) were more likely to 
      participate than people aged 75 years and over (61% versus 43% systematic, 49% 
      versus 42% opportunistic). No adverse events associated with screening were 
      reported.The incremental cost per additional case detected by opportunistic 
      screening was GBP 337, compared to GBP 1514 for systematic screening. All cost 
      estimates were based on data from the single included trial, which was conducted in 
      the UK between 2001 and 2003. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Systematic and opportunistic 
      screening for AF increase the rate of detection of new cases compared with routine 
      practice. While both approaches have a comparable effect on the overall AF diagnosis 
      rate, the cost of systematic screening is significantly more than that of 
      opportunistic screening from the perspective of the health service provider. The 
      lack of studies investigating the effect of screening in other health systems and 
      younger age groups means that caution needs to be exercised in relation to the 
      transferability of these results beyond the setting and population in which the 
      included study was conducted.Additional research is needed to examine the 
      effectiveness of alternative screening strategies and to investigate the effect of 
      the intervention on the risk of stroke for screened versus non-screened populations.

PG  - S1559-68
LID - 10.3233/BME-151455 [doi]
AB  - P wave and T wave in human-body electrocardiogram (ECG) signals often fuse together 
      when atrial premature contract (APC) occurs. P waves within the fused signals are 
      valuable for the measurement of P wave parameters as well as diagnosis of 
      supra-ventricular arrhythmias. However, the problem of extracting P wave from the 
      fused signals is seldom addressed. In this study, a novel T wave cancellation method 
      for P wave extraction based on maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation is proposed. In 
      order to accurately cancel the T wave within the fused signal, T wave and the timing 
      point of T wave peak are estimated simultaneously. The estimated timing point of T 
      wave peak is used as alignment reference point for T wave subtraction. Simulation 
      results show that the proposed method outperform the traditional T wave cancellation 
      method in terms of both normalized mean square error and cross-correlation index. 
      The results for real ECGs with APC demonstrate that the extracted P waves using the 
      proposed method are more similar to the non-overlapping P waves in terms of 
      morphology than the ones using the traditional T wave cancellation method.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Electrocardiogram ECG is one of the most important non-invasive 
      tools for cardiac diseases diagnosis. Taking advantage of the developed 
      telecommunication infrastructure, several approaches that address the development of 
      telemetry cardiac devices were introduced recently. Telemetry ECG devices allow easy 
      and fast ECG monitoring of patients with suspected cardiac issues. Choosing the 
      right device with the desired working mode, signal quality, and the device cost are 
      still the main obstacles to massive usage of these devices. METHODS: In this paper, 
      we introduce design, implementation, and validation of a multi-purpose telemetry 
      system for recording, transmission, and interpretation of ECG signals in different 
      recording modes. The system consists of an ECG device, a cloud-based analysis 
      pipeline, and accompanied mobile applications for physicians and patients. The 
      proposed ECG device's mechanical design allows laypersons to easily record 
      post-event short-term ECG signals, using dry electrodes without any preparation. 
      Moreover, patients can use the device to record long-term signals in loop and holter 
      modes, using wet electrodes. In order to overcome the problem of signal quality 
      fluctuation due to using different electrodes types and different placements on 
      subject's chest, customized ECG signal processing and interpretation pipeline is 
      presented for each working mode. RESULTS: We present the evaluation of the novel 
      short-term recorder design. Recording of an ECG signal was performed for 391 
      patients using a standard 12-leads golden standard ECG and the proposed 
      patient-activated short-term post-event recorder. In the validation phase, a sample 
      of validation signals followed peer review process wherein two experts annotated the 
      signals in terms of signal acceptability for diagnosis.We found that 96% of signals 
      allow detecting arrhythmia and other signal's abnormal changes. Additionally, we 
      compared and presented the correlation coefficient and the automatic QRS delineation 
      results of both short-term post-event recorder and 12-leads golden standard ECG 
      recorder. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed multi-purpose ECG device allows physicians to 
      choose the working mode of the same device according to the patient status. The 
      proposed device was designed to allow patients to manage the technical requirements 
      of both working modes. Post-event short-term ECG recording using the proposed design 
      provide physicians reliable three ECG leads with direct symptom-rhythm correlation.

TI  - Technical challenges related to implementation of a formula one real time data 
      acquisition and analysis system in a paediatric intensive care unit.

AB  - Most existing, expert monitoring systems do not provide the real time continuous 
      analysis of the monitored physiological data that is necessary to detect transient 
      or combined vital sign indicators nor do they provide long term storage of the data 
      for retrospective analyses. In this paper we examine the feasibility of implementing 
      a long term data storage system which has the ability to incorporate real-time data 
      analytics, the system design, report the main technical issues encountered, the 
      solutions implemented and the statistics of the data recorded. McLaren Electronic 
      Systems expertise used to continually monitor and analyse the data from F1 racing 
      cars in real time was utilised to implement a similar real-time data recording 
      platform system adapted with real time analytics to suit the requirements of the 
      intensive care environment. We encountered many technical (hardware and software) 
      implementation challenges. However there were many advantages of the system once it 
      was operational. They include: (1) The ability to store the data for long periods of 
      time enabling access to historical physiological data. (2) The ability to alter the 
      time axis to contract or expand periods of interest. (3) The ability to store and 
      review ECG morphology retrospectively. (4) Detailed post event (cardiac/respiratory 
      arrest or other clinically significant deteriorations in patients) data can be 
      reviewed clinically as opposed to trend data providing valuable clinical insight. 
      Informed mortality and morbidity reviews can be conducted. (5) Storage of waveform 
      data capture to use for algorithm development for adaptive early warning systems. 
      Recording data from bed-side monitors in intensive care/wards is feasible. It is 
      possible to set up real time data recording and long term storage systems. These 
      systems in future can be improved with additional patient specific metrics which 
      predict the status of a patient thus paving the way for real time predictive 
      monitoring.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate qualitatively and quantitatively non-linear 
      and linear characteristics of heart rate identifying their connection to sleep 
      states during the first 6 months of life. 16 newborns were examined polygraphically 
      in a longitudinal study (first day, first and sixth month). After R-peak detection 
      of a limb lead ECG and R-R interval calculation, time series of the instantaneous 
      heart rate (IHR) were constructed. They were analyzed qualitatively with regard to 
      the structure of the Poincaré maps and the occurrence of bifurcations as well as 
      quantitatively by calculating the correlation dimension (D2) and the Lyapunov 
      exponent (LLE). In some cases, bifurcations in the IHR time series occurred. The 
      Poincaré maps showed mainly clear structures in the shape of limited point clusters. 
      D2 was in the range of 1.5 to 2.5 and was larger in quiet than in active sleep. LLE 
      was always positive, although higher values in active sleep than in quiet sleep were 
      exhibited in the first month of life only. D2 and LLE values during active sleep 
      were age-dependent. The results of the study indicate a non-linear component in the 
      heart rate control of healthy newborns. The change in D2 and LLE in connection with 
      postnatal age and sleep states expresses a modulation of these system components 
      during the postnatal maturation and during vegetative sleep organisation.

AB  - Electrocardiogram (ECG) anomaly detection is an important technique for detecting 
      dissimilar heartbeats which helps identify abnormal ECGs before the diagnosis 
      process. Currently available ECG anomaly detection methods, ranging from academic 
      research to commercial ECG machines, still suffer from a high false alarm rate 
      because these methods are not able to differentiate ECG artifacts from real ECG 
      signal, especially, in ECG artifacts that are similar to ECG signals in terms of 
      shape and/or frequency. The problem leads to high vigilance for physicians and 
      misinterpretation risk for nonspecialists. Therefore, this work proposes a novel 
      anomaly detection technique that is highly robust and accurate in the presence of 
      ECG artifacts which can effectively reduce the false alarm rate. Expert knowledge 
      from cardiologists and motif discovery technique is utilized in our design. In 
      addition, every step of the algorithm conforms to the interpretation of 
      cardiologists. Our method can be utilized to both single-lead ECGs and multilead 
      ECGs. Our experiment results on real ECG datasets are interpreted and evaluated by 
      cardiologists. Our proposed algorithm can mostly achieve 100% of accuracy on 
      detection (AoD), sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value with 0% 
      false alarm rate. The results demonstrate that our proposed method is highly 
      accurate and robust to artifacts, compared with competitive anomaly detection 
      methods.

TI  - ADARRI: a novel method to detect spurious R-peaks in the electrocardiogram for heart 
      rate variability analysis in the intensive care unit.
PG  - 53-61
LID - 10.1007/s10877-017-9999-9 [doi]
AB  - We developed a simple and fully automated method for detecting artifacts in the R-R 
      interval (RRI) time series of the ECG that is tailored to the intensive care unit 
      (ICU) setting. From ECG recordings of 50 adult ICU-subjects we selected 60 epochs 
      with valid R-peak detections and 60 epochs containing artifacts leading to missed or 
      false positive R-peak detections. Next, we calculated the absolute value of the 
      difference between two adjacent RRIs (adRRI), and obtained the empirical probability 
      distributions of adRRI values for valid R-peaks and artifacts. From these, we 
      calculated an optimal threshold for separating adRRI values arising from artifact 
      versus non-artefactual data. We compared the performance of our method with the 
      methods of Berntson and Clifford on the same data. We identified 257,458 R-peak 
      detections, of which 235,644 (91.5%) were true detections and 21,814 (8.5%) arose 
      from artifacts. Our method showed superior performance for detecting artifacts with 
      sensitivity 100%, specificity 99%, precision 99%, positive likelihood ratio of 100 
      and negative likelihood ratio <0.001 compared to Berntson's and Clifford's method 
      with a sensitivity, specificity, precision and positive and negative likelihood 
      ratio of 99%, 78%, 82%, 4.5, 0.013 for Berntson's method and 55%, 98%, 96%, 27.5, 
      0.460 for Clifford's method, respectively. A novel algorithm using a 
      patient-independent threshold derived from the distribution of adRRI values in ICU 
      ECG data identifies artifacts accurately, and outperforms two other methods in 
      common use. Furthermore, the threshold was calculated based on real data from 
      critically ill patients and the algorithm is easy to implement.

TI  - [Circadian rhythms in the spectrum of heart rate variability].
PG  - 460-2
AB  - Heart rate shows a circadian rhythm. This has not yet been sufficiently investigated 
      for its variability till now, which challenges the analysis of rhythms of the 
      variability and their validity in long time records. For this purpose, time series 
      of heart period duration (HPD) and sinus arrhythmia (SA) were measured in 30 
      children in a boarding-school (14 male, 16 female, 12 to 14 years of age) from the 
      ECG for 5 min/h during 24 h. Fast Fourier transform provided the spectra and the 
      power density. HPD, SA, power maxima and their frequencies were analyzed for 
      circadian rhythms according to Halberg. Times of meals and sleep were uniform. Power 
      and frequencies of the spectra showed individual patterns, stable throughout the day 
      in 2 diverse groups. SA, high- (HF) and middle frequent (MF) spectral parts show 
      circadian oscillations in frequency or power with acrophases during day or night, 
      often in contrast to HF and MF. This proves the existence of circadian rhythms of 
      heart rate variability for SA, HF and MF. In some cases, the individual 24-h 
      patterns are superimposed by effects of external zeitgeber, e.g. meals.

AB  - Existing arrhythmia classification methods usually use manual selection of 
      electrocardiogram (ECG) signal features, so that the feature selection is 
      subjective, and the feature extraction is complex, leaving the classification 
      accuracy usually affected. Based on this situation, a new method of arrhythmia 
      automatic classification based on discriminative deep belief networks (DDBNs) is 
      proposed. The morphological features of heart beat signals are automatically 
      extracted from the constructed generative restricted Boltzmann machine (GRBM), then 
      the discriminative restricted Boltzmann machine (DRBM) with feature learning and 
      classification ability is introduced, and arrhythmia classification is performed 
      according to the extracted morphological features and RR interval features. In order 
      to further improve the classification performance of DDBNs, DDBNs are converted to 
      deep neural network (DNN) using the Softmax regression layer for supervised 
      classification in this paper, and the network is fine-tuned by backpropagation. 
      Finally, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Beth Israel Hospital 
      Arrhythmia Database (MIT-BIH AR) is used for experimental verification. For training 
      sets and test sets with consistent data sources, the overall classification accuracy 
      of the method is up to 99.84% ± 0.04%. For training sets and test sets with 
      inconsistent data sources, a small number of training sets are extended by the 
      active learning (AL) method, and the overall classification accuracy of the method 
      is up to 99.31% ± 0.23%. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the 
      method in arrhythmia automatic feature extraction and classification. It provides a 
      new solution for the automatic extraction of ECG signal features and classification 
      for deep learning.

TI  - Considering New Regularization Parameter-Choice Techniques for the Tikhonov Method 
      to Improve the Accuracy of Electrocardiographic Imaging.

AB  - The electrocardiographic imaging (ECGI) inverse problem highly relies on adding 
      constraints, a process called regularization, as the problem is ill-posed. When 
      there are no prior information provided about the unknown epicardial potentials, the 
      Tikhonov regularization method seems to be the most commonly used technique. In the 
      Tikhonov approach the weight of the constraints is determined by the regularization 
      parameter. However, the regularization parameter is problem and data dependent, 
      meaning that different numerical models or different clinical data may require 
      different regularization parameters. Then, we need to have as many regularization 
      parameter-choice methods as techniques to validate them. In this work, we addressed 
      this issue by showing that the Discrete Picard Condition (DPC) can guide a good 
      regularization parameter choice for the two-norm Tikhonov method. We also studied 
      the feasibility of two techniques: The U-curve method (not yet used in the cardiac 
      field) and a novel automatic method, called ADPC due its basis on the DPC. Both 
      techniques were tested with simulated and experimental data when using the method of 
      fundamental solutions as a numerical model. Their efficacy was compared with the 
      efficacy of two widely used techniques in the literature, the L-curve and the CRESO 
      methods. These solutions showed the feasibility of the new techniques in the cardiac 
      setting, an improvement of the morphology of the reconstructed epicardial 
      potentials, and in most of the cases of their amplitude.

AB  - The concurrent usage of actigraphy and heart rate variability (HRV) for sleep 
      efficiency quantification is still matter of investigation. This study compared 
      chest (CACT) and wrist (WACT) actigraphy (actigraphs positioned on chest and wrist, 
      respectively) in combination with HRV for automatic sleep vs wake classification. 
      Accelerometer and ECG signals were collected during polysomnographic studies (PSGs) 
      including 18 individuals (25-53 years old) with no previous history of sleep 
      disorders. Then, an experienced neurologist performed sleep staging on PSG data. 
      Eleven features from HRV and accelerometry were extracted from series of different 
      lengths. A support vector machine (SVM) was used to automatically distinguish sleep 
      and wake. We found 7 min as the optimal signal length for classification, while 
      maximizing specificity (wake detection). CACT and WACT provided similar accuracies 
      (78% chest vs 77% wrist), larger than what yielded by HRV alone (66%). The addition 
      of HRV to CACT reduced slightly the accuracy, while improving specificity (from 33% 
      to 51%, p < 0.05). On the contrary, the concurrent usage of HRV and WACT did not 
      provide statistically significant improvements over WACT. Then, a subset of features 
      (3 from HRV + 1 from actigraphy) was selected by reducing redundancy using a 
      strategy based on Spearman's correlation and area under the ROC curve. The usage of 
      the reduced set of features and SVM classifier gave only slightly reduced 
      classification performances, which did not differ from the full sets of features. 
      The study opens interesting possibilities in the design of wearable devices for 
      long-term monitoring of sleep at home.

AB  - The measures of nonlinear properties of RR interval and QT interval time series are 
      sensitive to physiologically- or pathologically-induced complexity/regularity 
      changes, but were not used to estimate the effect of alcohol intake. We wanted to 
      examine the potential of these measures to quantify the acute effect of a low dose 
      of red wine in healthy subjects. In separate experiments, fourteen young volunteers 
      drank 200ml of red wine and a control drink with equal concentration of ethanol. ECG 
      in supine position was recorded 20min before and 60min after drink intake. RR 
      interval and QT interval series were extracted from ECG and we calculated 
      variability, scaling exponents (α1 and α2) and sample entropy (SampEn) for both 
      series. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures (BP) were measured every 10min. The 
      immediate effect of both the drinks was equal: HR, BP and QT variability exhibited a 
      sudden increase and then a decrease. However, the prolonged effect of wine and the 
      control drink was different. Wine decreased both BP (p<0.05) and reduced complexity 
      of RR and QT series (increased scaling exponents and decreased SampEn). The control 
      drink prolonged QT and RR intervals (p<0.05). These results point out that the 
      nonlinear properties of RR and QT interval series could be used to differentiate the 
      effect of wine and ethanol. Changes in RR and QT interval series induced by a low 
      dose of red wine are more detectable by methods that quantify the structure of the 
      series than by methods that quantify their variability.

TI  - Automatic Triage of 12-Lead ECGs Using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks.
PG  - e015138
LID - 10.1161/JAHA.119.015138 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND The correct interpretation of the ECG is pivotal for the accurate 
      diagnosis of many cardiac abnormalities, and conventional computerized 
      interpretation has not been able to reach physician-level accuracy in detecting 
      (acute) cardiac abnormalities. This study aims to develop and validate a deep neural 
      network for comprehensive automated ECG triage in daily practice. METHODS AND 
      RESULTS We developed a 37-layer convolutional residual deep neural network on a data 
      set of free-text physician-annotated 12-lead ECGs. The deep neural network was 
      trained on a data set with 336.835 recordings from 142.040 patients and validated on 
      an independent validation data set (n=984), annotated by a panel of 5 cardiologists 
      electrophysiologists. The 12-lead ECGs were acquired in all noncardiology 
      departments of the University Medical Center Utrecht. The algorithm learned to 
      classify these ECGs into the following 4 triage categories: normal, abnormal not 
      acute, subacute, and acute. Discriminative performance is presented with overall and 
      category-specific concordance statistics, polytomous discrimination indexes, 
      sensitivities, specificities, and positive and negative predictive values. The 
      patients in the validation data set had a mean age of 60.4 years and 54.3% were men. 
      The deep neural network showed excellent overall discrimination with an overall 
      concordance statistic of 0.93 (95% CI, 0.92-0.95) and a polytomous discriminatory 
      index of 0.83 (95% CI, 0.79-0.87). CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrates that an 
      end-to-end deep neural network can be accurately trained on unstructured free-text 
      physician annotations and used to consistently triage 12-lead ECGs. When further 
      fine-tuned with other clinical outcomes and externally validated in clinical 
      practice, the demonstrated deep learning-based ECG interpretation can potentially 
      improve time to treatment and decrease healthcare burden.

TI  - A Novel Algorithm for the Automatic Detection of Sleep Apnea From Single-Lead ECG.
PG  - 2269-2278
LID - 10.1109/TBME.2015.2422378 [doi]
AB  - GOAL: This paper presents a methodology for the automatic detection of sleep apnea 
      from single-lead ECG. METHODS: It uses two novel features derived from the ECG, and 
      two well-known features in heart rate variability analysis, namely the standard 
      deviation and the serial correlation coefficients of the RR interval time series. 
      The first novel feature uses the principal components of the QRS complexes, and it 
      describes changes in their morphology caused by an increased sympathetic activity 
      during apnea. The second novel feature extracts the information shared between 
      respiration and heart rate using orthogonal subspace projections. Respiratory 
      information is derived from the ECG by means of three state-of-the-art algorithms, 
      which are implemented and compared here. All features are used as input to a 
      least-squares support vector machines classifier, using an RBF kernel. In total, 80 
      ECG recordings were included in the study. RESULTS: Accuracies of about 85% are 
      achieved on a minute-by-minute basis, for two independent datasets including both 
      hypopneas and apneas together. Separation between apnea and normal recordings is 
      achieved with 100% accuracy. In addition to apnea classification, the proposed 
      methodology determines the contamination level of each ECG minute. CONCLUSION: The 
      performances achieved are comparable with those reported in the literature for fully 
      automated algorithms. SIGNIFICANCE: These results indicate that the use of only ECG 
      sensors can achieve good accuracies in the detection of sleep apnea. Moreover, the 
      contamination level of each ECG segment can be used to automatically detect 
      artefacts, and to highlight segments that require further visual inspection.

TI  - On the resolution of ECG acquisition systems for the reliable analysis of the 
      P-wave.
PG  - N11-7
LID - 10.1088/0967-3334/33/2/N11 [doi]
AB  - The analysis of the P-wave on surface ECG is widely used to assess the risk of 
      atrial arrhythmias. In order to provide reliable results, the automatic analysis of 
      the P-wave must be precise and reliable and must take into account technical 
      aspects, one of those being the resolution of the acquisition system. The aim of 
      this note is to investigate the effects of the amplitude resolution of ECG 
      acquisition systems on the P-wave analysis. Starting from ECG recorded by an 
      acquisition system with a less significant bit (LSB) of 31 nV (24 bit on an input 
      range of 524 mVpp), we reproduced an ECG signal as acquired by systems with lower 
      resolution (16, 15, 14, 13 and 12 bit). We found that, when the LSB is of the order 
      of 128 µV (12 bit), a single P-wave is not recognizable on ECG. However, when 
      averaging is applied, a P-wave template can be extracted, apparently suitable for 
      the P-wave analysis. Results obtained in terms of P-wave duration and morphology 
      revealed that the analysis of ECG at lowest resolutions (from 12 to 14 bit, LSB 
      higher than 30 µV) could lead to misleading results. However, the resolution used 
      nowadays in modern electrocardiographs (15 and 16 bit, LSB <10 µV) is sufficient for 
      the reliable analysis of the P-wave.

LID - 10.3390/s17081888 [doi]
LID - 1888
AB  - This paper presents a wearable electrophysiological interface with enhanced immunity 
      to motion artifacts. Anti-artifact schemes, including a patch-type modular structure 
      and real-time automatic level adjustment, are proposed and verified in two wireless 
      system prototypes of a patch-type electrocardiogram (ECG) module and an 
      electromyogram (EMG)-based robot-hand controller. Their common ExG readout 
      integrated circuit (ROIC), which is reconfigurable for multiple physiological 
      interfaces, is designed and fabricated in a 0.18 μm CMOS process. Moreover, analog 
      pre-processing structures based on envelope detection are integrated with one 
      another to mitigate signal processing burdens in the digital domain effectively.

AB  - In this study, we aimed to seek for different ways of measuring cardiac stress in 
      terms of heart rate variability (HRV) and heart rate (HR) dynamics, and to develop a 
      novel index that can effectively summarize the information reflected by these 
      measures to continuously and quantitatively characterize the cardiac stress status 
      during physical exercise. Standard deviation, spectral measure of HRV as well as a 
      nonlinear detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) based fractal-like behavior measure 
      of HR dynamics were all evaluated on the RR time series derived from windowed 
      electrocardiogram (ECG) data for the subjects undergoing cycling exercise. We 
      recruited eleven young healthy subjects in our tests. Each subject was asked to 
      maintain a fixed speed under a constant load during the pedaling test. We obtained 
      the running estimates of the standard deviation of the normal-to-normal interval 
      (SDNN), the high-fidelity power spectral density (PSD) of HRV, and the DFA scaling 
      exponent α, respectively. A trend analysis and a multivariate linear regression 
      analysis of these measures were then performed. Numerical experimental results 
      produced by our analyses showed that a decrease in both SDNN and α was seen during 
      the cycling exercise, while there was no significant correlation between the 
      standard lower frequency to higher frequency (LF-to-HF) spectral power ratio of HRV 
      and the exercise intensity. In addition, while the SDNN and α were both negatively 
      correlated with the Borg rating of perceived exertion (RPE) scale value, it seemed 
      that the LF-to-HF power ratio might not have substantial impact on the Borg value, 
      suggesting that the SDNN and α may be further used as features to detect the cardiac 
      stress status during the physical exercise. We further approached this detection 
      problem by applying a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) to both feature candidates 
      for the task of cardiac stress stratification. As a result, a time-varying 
      parameter, referred to as the cardiac stress measure (CSM), is developed for 
      quantitatively on-line measuring and stratifying cardiac stress status.

TI  - Practice of hemodynamic monitoring and management in German, Austrian, and Swiss 
      intensive care units: the multicenter cross-sectional ICU-CardioMan Study.
PG  - 49

LID - 49
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hemodynamic instability is frequent and outcome-relevant in critical 
      illness. The understanding of complex hemodynamic disturbances and their monitoring 
      and management plays an important role in treatment of intensive care patients. An 
      increasing number of treatment recommendations and guidelines in intensive care 
      medicine emphasize hemodynamic goals, which go beyond the measurement of blood 
      pressures. Yet, it is not known to which extent the infrastructural prerequisites 
      for extended hemodynamic monitoring are given in intensive care units (ICUs) and how 
      hemodynamic management is performed in clinical practice. Further, it is still 
      unclear which factors trigger the use of extended hemodynamic monitoring. METHODS: 
      In this multicenter, 1-day (November 7, 2013, and the preceding 24 h) 
      cross-sectional study, we retrieved data on patient monitoring from ICUs in Germany, 
      Austria, and Switzerland by means of a web-based case report form. One hundred and 
      sixty-one intensive care units contributed detailed information on availability of 
      hemodynamic monitoring. In addition, detailed information on hemodynamic monitoring 
      of 1789 patients that were treated on due date was collected, and independent 
      factors triggering the use of extended hemodynamic monitoring were identified by 
      multivariate analysis. RESULTS: Besides basic monitoring with electrocardiography 
      (ECG), pulse oximetry, and blood pressure monitoring, the majority of patients 
      received invasive arterial (77.9 %) and central venous catheterization (55.2 %). All 
      over, additional extended hemodynamic monitoring for assessment of cardiac output 
      was only performed in 12.3 % of patients, while echocardiographic examination was 
      used in only 1.9 %. The strongest independent predictors for the use of extended 
      hemodynamic monitoring of any kind were mechanical ventilation, the need for 
      catecholamine therapy, and treatment backed by protocols. In 71.6 % of patients in 
      whom extended hemodynamic monitoring was added during the study period, this 
      extension led to changes in treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Extended hemodynamic monitoring, 
      which goes beyond the measurement of blood pressures, to date plays a minor role in 
      the surveillance of critically ill patients in German, Austrian, and Swiss ICUs. 
      This includes also consensus-based recommended diagnostic and monitoring 
      applications, such as echocardiography and cardiac output monitoring. Mechanical 
      ventilation, the use of catecholamines, and treatment backed by protocol could be 
      identified as factors independently associated with higher use of extended 
      hemodynamic monitoring.

AB  - This study proposes a deep learning model that effectively suppresses the false 
      alarms in the intensive care units (ICUs) without ignoring the true alarms using 
      single- and multi- modal biosignals. Most of the current work in the literature are 
      either rule-based methods, requiring prior knowledge of arrhythmia analysis to build 
      rules, or classical machine learning approaches, depending on hand-engineered 
      features. In this work, we apply convolutional neural networks to automatically 
      extract time-invariant features, an attention mechanism to put more emphasis on the 
      important regions of the segmented input signal(s) that are more likely to 
      contribute to an alarm, and long short-term memory units to capture the temporal 
      information presented in the signal segments. We trained our method efficiently 
      using a two-step training algorithm (i.e., pre-training and fine-tuning the proposed 
      network) on the dataset provided by the PhysioNet computing in cardiology challenge 
      2015. The evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed method obtains better 
      results compared to other existing algorithms for the false alarm reduction task in 
      ICUs. The proposed method achieves a sensitivity of 93.88% and a specificity of 
      92.05% for the alarm classification, considering three different signals. In 
      addition, our experiments for 5 separate alarm types leads significant results, 
      where we just consider a single-lead ECG (e.g., a sensitivity of 90.71%, a 
      specificity of 88.30%, an AUC of 89.51 for alarm type of Ventricular Tachycardia 
      arrhythmia).

AB  - Intensive care unit (ICU) experienced and skillful people in this field should be 
      employed because the equipment, facilities, and admitted patients have more special 
      conditions than other departments. Our goal provides the best quality according to 
      the condition each patient and prevent many unnecessary costs for preventive 
      treatment. In this paper, the proposed system will first receive the patient's vital 
      signs, which are recorded by the ICU monitoring. After the necessary processing, in 
      case of observing changes in the normal state, risk alarms are transmitted to the 
      nursing station so that nurses become aware of this condition and take all equipment 
      to return the patient to normal condition and prevent his death. The applied graph 
      in this study examines patients at any moment and displays the patient's future 
      condition in a schematic manner after precise analyses. In this algorithm, after 
      calculating the R-R intervals in the electrocardiogram signal, RRIs are thrown into 
      a risk plot (RP) by a projectile. Given the amount of projectile RRI, one of the 
      stairs can host that amount. After a few moments by springs embedded under the 
      stairs, the drain of RRIs is done by the kinetic energy stored in the springs 
      towards the valley of life. If the accumulation of quantities in a stair is too 
      much, the spring will not be able to project those RRIs. By examining this 
      situation, we will introduce an index to determine the risk of death for all 
      patients. The results of this paper show that when a person is in normal condition, 
      there is no density in a certain stair and the ball or the projected RRIs are not 
      limited to a stair. In general, the results of this paper show that the lower amount 
      of RRI dispersion in the RP leads to greater risk of entry into the death range and 
      as this amount decrease, an immediate consideration is required. In conclusion, if 
      the precise prediction of the future condition of ICU patients is available to 
      nurses and doctors, more facilities and equipment could be provided to save their 
      lives. •We focused on nonlinear methods with new aspects to extract mentioned 
      dynamics.•This method can reduce the number of ICU nurses and give the special 
      facilities for high-risk patients.•Our results confirm that it is possible to 
      predict mortality based on the dynamical characteristics of HRV.

AB  - The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a key diagnostic tool in heart disease and may serve 
      to detect ischemia, arrhythmias, and other conditions. Automatic, low cost 
      monitoring of the ECG signal could be used to provide instantaneous analysis in case 
      of symptoms and may trigger the presentation to the emergency department. Currently, 
      since mobile devices (smartphones, tablets) are an integral part of daily life, they 
      could form an ideal basis for automatic and low cost monitoring solution of the ECG 
      signal. In this work, we aim for a realtime classification system for arrhythmia 
      detection that is able to run on Android-based mobile devices. Our analysis is based 
      on 70% of the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia and on 70% of the MIT-BIH Supraventricular 
      Arrhythmia databases. The remaining 30% are reserved for the final evaluation. We 
      detected the R-peaks with a QRS detection algorithm and based on the detected 
      R-peaks, we calculated 16 features (statistical, heartbeat, and template-based). 
      With these features and four different feature subsets we trained 8 classifiers 
      using the Embedded Classification Software Toolbox (ECST) and compared the 
      computational costs for each classification decision and the memory demand for each 
      classifier. We conclude that the C4.5 classifier is best for our two-class 
      classification problem (distinction of normal and abnormal heartbeats) with an 
      accuracy of 91.6%. This classifier still needs a detailed feature selection 
      evaluation. Our next steps are implementing the C4.5 classifier for Android-based 
      mobile devices and evaluating the final system using the remaining 30% of the two 
      used databases.

AB  - Heart rate variability (HRV), analysis gives an insight into the state of the 
      autonomic nervous system which modulates the cardiac activity. Here a digital signal 
      controller based handy device is developed which acquires the beat to beat time 
      interval, processes it using techniques based on non-linear dynamics, fractal time 
      series analysis, and information theory. The technique employed, that can give 
      reliable results by assessing heart beat signals fetched for a duration of a few 
      minutes, is a huge advantage over the already existing methodologies of assessing 
      cardiac health, those being dependant on the tedious task of acquiring Electro 
      Cardio Gram(ECG) signals, which in turn requires the subject to lie down at a 
      stretch for a couple of hours. The sensor used, relies on the technique of 
      Photoplethysmography, rendering the whole approach as noninvasive. The device 
      designed, calculates parameters like, Largest Lyapunov Exponent, Fractal dimension, 
      Correlation Dimension, Approximate Entropy and α-slope of Poincare plots, which 
      based on the range in which they fall, the cardiac health condition of the subject 
      can be assessed to even the extend of predicting upcoming disorders. The design of 
      heart beat sensor, the technique used in the acquisition of heart beat data, the 
      relevant algorithm developed for the analysis purpose, are presented here.

      patients.
PG  - 1049-56
LID - 10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.111.176644 [doi]
AB  - Autonomic dysfunction, including baroreceptor attenuation and sympathetic 
      activation, has been reported in patients with myocardial infarction (MI) and has 
      been associated with increased mortality. We tested the hypotheses that exercise 
      training (ET) in post-MI patients would normalize arterial baroreflex sensitivity 
      (BRS) and muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA), and long-term ET would maintain 
      the benefits in BRS and MSNA. Twenty-eight patients after 1 month of uncomplicated 
      MI were randomly assigned to 2 groups, ET (MI-ET) and untrained. A normal control 
      group was also studied. ET consisted of three 60-minute exercise sessions per week 
      for 6 months. We evaluated MSNA (microneurography), blood pressure (automatic 
      oscillometric method), heart rate (ECG), and spectral analysis of RR interval, 
      systolic arterial pressure (SAP), and MSNA. Baroreflex gain of SAP-RR interval and 
      SAP-MSNA were calculated using the α-index. At 3 to 5 days and 1 month after MI, 
      MSNA and low-frequency SAP were significantly higher and BRS significantly lower in 
      MI patients when compared with the normal control group. ET significantly decreased 
      MSNA (bursts per 100 heartbeats) and the low-frequency component of SAP and 
      significantly increased the low-frequency component of MSNA and BRS of the RR 
      interval and MSNA. These changes were so marked that the differences between 
      patients with MI and the normal control group were no longer observed after ET. MSNA 
      and BRS in the MI-untrained group did not change from baseline over the same time 
      period. ET normalizes BRS, low-frequency SAP, and MSNA in patients with MI. These 
      improvements in autonomic control are maintained by long-term ET. These findings 
      highlight the clinical importance of this nonpharmacological therapy based on ET in 
      the long-term treatment of patients with MI.

TI  - Automatic estimation of the correlation dimension for the analysis of 
      electrocardiograms.
PG  - 279-90
AB  - The main purpose of the present work is the definition of a fully automatic 
      procedure for correlation dimension (D(2)) estimation. In the first part, the 
      procedure for the estimation of the correlation dimension (D(2)) is proposed and 
      tested on various types of mathematical models: chaotic (Lorenz and Henon models), 
      periodical (sinusoidal waves) and stochastic (Gaussian and uniform noise). In all 
      cases, accurate D(2) estimates were obtained. The procedure can detect the presence 
      of multiple scaling regions in the correlation integral function. The connection 
      between the presence of multiple scaling regions and multiple dynamic activities 
      cooperating in a system is investigated through the study of composite time series. 
      In the second part of the paper, the proposed algorithm is applied to the study of 
      cardiac electrical activity through the analysis of electrocardiographic signals 
      (ECG) obtained from the commercially available MIT-BIH ECG arrhythmia database. 
      Three groups of ECG signals have been considered: the ECGs of normal subjects and 
      ECGs of subjects with atrial fibrillation and with premature ventricular 
      contraction. D(2) estimates are computed on single ECG intervals (static analysis) 
      of appropriate duration, striking a balance between stationarity requisites and 
      accurate computation requirements. In addition, D(2) temporal variability is studied 
      by analyzing consecutive intervals of ECG tracings (dynamic analysis). The procedure 
      reveals the presence of multiple scaling regions in many ECG signals, and the D(2) 
      temporal variability differs in the three ECG groups considered; it is greater in 
      the case of atrial fibrillation than in normal sinus rhythms. This study points out 
      the importance of considering both the static and dynamic D(2) analysis for a more 
      complete study of the system under analysis. While the static analysis visualizes 
      the underlying heart activity, dynamic D(2) analysis insights the time evolution of 
      the underlying system.

TI  - Dose study of electrocardiogram automatic tube current modulation technology in 
      prospective coronary computed tomography angiography scans of overweight patients.
PG  - 2384-2388
AB  - The aim of the present study was to investigate the X-ray absorption dose and 
      clinical applications of electrocardiogram (ECG)-gated automatic tube current 
      modulation (ATCM) technology in prospective sequential computed tomography coronary 
      angiography (CTCA) scans of overweight patients. A total of 40 patients with a body 
      mass index of >24 were divided at random into groups A and B. Group A consisted of 
      20 patients, who were examined using ECG-ATCM scanning. For the patients in group A 
      with heart rates <70 bpm, the scanning range was 20-80% of the R-R interval and the 
      patients received full-dose X-rays for 60-80% of the R-R interval. For the group A 
      patients with heart rates >70 bpm, the scanning range was 20-80% of the R-R interval 
      and the patients received full-dose scanning for 35-55% of the R-R interval. For the 
      20 patients in group B, the scanning range was 20-80% of the R-R interval and 
      patients received a full dose of X-ray radiation for the entire scanning period. The 
      image quality and radiation dose was compared between the two groups. The average 
      radiation dose in groups A and B was 6.91±2.78 and 10.43±3.36, respectively. The 
      radiation doses in group A were reduced by 33.77% when compared with group B 
      (P<0.05). However, there was no marked difference observed in image quality. In 
      summary, using ECG-ATCM technology in prospective sequential CTCA scanning may 
      significantly reduce the radiation dose required for overweight patients.

      image-based device tracking.
PG  - 1077-1082
LID - 10.1002/ccd.26340 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the feasibility of automated co-registration of angiography 
      and intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) to facilitate integration of these two imaging 
      modalities in a synchronous manner. BACKGROUND: IVUS provides cross-sectional 
      imaging of coronary arteries but lacks overview of the vascular territory provided 
      by angiography. Co-registration of angiography and IVUS would increase utility of 
      IVUS in the clinical setting. METHODS: Forty-nine consecutive patients undergoing 
      surveillance for cardiac allograft vasculopathy with angiography and IVUS of the 
      left anterior descending artery (LAD) were enrolled. A pre-IVUS angiogram of the LAD 
      was performed followed by an ECG-triggered fluoroscopy (ECGTF) during IVUS pullback 
      at 0.5 mm/s using an automatic pullback device. ECGTF was used to track the IVUS 
      catheter during pullback and establish a spatial relationship to the pre-IVUS 
      angiogram. Angio-IVUS co-registration was performed with a research prototype 
      (Siemens Healthcare, Germany) and accuracy was evaluated by distance mismatch 
      between angiography and IVUS images at vessel bifurcations. RESULTS: Median age was 
      54 (44.5, 67) years. The population was 82.6% male with minimal risk factors. The 
      median (IQR) co-registration distance mismatch measured at 108 bifurcations in 42 
      (85%) patients was 0.35 (0.00-1.16) mm. Seven patients were excluded due to 
      inappropriate data acquisition (n = 3) and failure of tracking (n = 4), e.g., due to 
      overlapping sternal wires. Estimated effective radiation dose for ECGTF was 
      0.09 mSv. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the feasibility of angio-IVUS 
      co-registration which may be used as a clinical tool for localizing IVUS 
      cross-sections along an angiographic roadmap. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - The acceleration and deceleration patterns in heartbeat fluctuations distribute 
      asymmetrically, which is known as heart rate asymmetry (HRA). It is hypothesized 
      that HRA reflects the balancing regulation of the sympathetic and parasympathetic 
      nervous systems. This study was designed to examine whether altered autonomic 
      balance during exercise can lead to HRA changes. Sixteen healthy college students 
      were enrolled, and each student undertook two 5-min ECG measurements: one in a 
      resting seated position and another while walking on a treadmill at a regular speed 
      of 5 km/h. The two measurements were conducted in a randomized order, and a 30-min 
      rest was required between them. RR interval time series were extracted from the 
      5-min ECG data, and HRA (short-term) was estimated using four established metrics, 
      that is, Porta's index (PI), Guzik's index (GI), slope index (SI), and area index 
      (AI), from both raw RR interval time series and the time series after wavelet 
      detrending that removes the low-frequency component of <~0.03 Hz. Our pilot data 
      showed a reduced PI but unchanged GI, SI, and AI during walking compared to resting 
      seated position based on the raw data. Based on the wavelet-detrended data, reduced 
      PI, SI, and AI were observed while GI still showed no significant changes. The 
      reduced PI during walking based on both raw and detrended data which suggests less 
      short-term HRA may underline the belief that vagal tone is withdrawn during 
      low-intensity exercise. GI may not be sensitive to short-term HRA. The reduced SI 
      and AI based on detrended data suggest that they may capture both short- and 
      long-term HRA features and that the expected change in short-term HRA is amplified 
      after removing the trend that is supposed to link to long-term component. Further 
      studies with more subjects and longer measurements are warranted to validate our 
      observations and to examine these additional hypotheses.

TI  - Impaired signaling intrinsic to sinoatrial node pacemaker cells affects heart rate 
      variability during cardiac disease.
LID - 152 [pii]
AB  - The normal heart beat intervals are neither strictly stationary nor completely 
      random, and continuously shift from one period to another. Decoding the ECG 
      identifies this "hidden" information that imparts inherent complexity to the 
      heart-beating interval time series. Loss of this complexity in cardiovascular 
      disease is manifested as a reduction in heart rate variability (HRV) and this 
      reduction correlates with an increase in both morbidity and mortality. Because HRV 
      measurements are noninvasive and easy to perform, they have emerged as an important 
      tool in cardiology. However, the identities of specific mechanisms that underline 
      the changes in HRV that occur in cardiovascular diseases remain largely unknown. 
      Changes in HRV have mainly been interpreted on a neural basis, ie due to changes in 
      autonomic impulses to the heart: sympathetic activity decreases both the average 
      heart beat interval and HRV, and parasympathetic activity increases both. It has now 
      become clear, however, that the heart rate and HRV are also determined by intrinsic 
      properties of the pacemaker cells that comprise the sinoatrial node, and the 
      responses of these properties to autonomic receptor stimulation. Here we review how 
      changes in the properties of coupled-clock mechanisms intrinsic to pacemaker cells 
      that comprise the sinoatrial node and their impaired response to autonomic receptor 
      stimulation are implicated in the changes of HRV observed in heart diseases.

TI  - Is telemetry useful in evaluating chest pain patients in an observation unit?
PG  - 543-6
LID - 10.1007/s11739-011-0648-x [doi]
AB  - Since the development of coronary care units (CCUs), telemetry has rapidly become 
      the standard of care in evaluating patients with suspected acute coronary syndromes, 
      regardless of the probability for ischemia. However, there is no data to support 
      this practice. Our objective was to evaluate the utility of routine cardiac 
      monitoring in a chest pain observation unit. We prospectively studied the utility of 
      routine cardiac monitoring in 249 consecutive patients admitted to an observation 
      unit in an academic Emergency Department over a 6-month period. All the patients 
      presented with chest pain thought to be cardiac ischemia. Observation included 
      serial cardiac enzymes, ECG cardiac monitoring, and exercise testing in a designated 
      chest pain observation unit. These patients were determined to be at low risk for an 
      acute coronary event by two criteria: first, the symptoms had resolved by the time 
      of observation unit admission, and second, the initial ECG was normal, unchanged or 
      non-diagnostic for acute ischemia. Adverse outcomes included cardiac arrest, 
      hospital admission secondary to cardiac dysrhythmia, or alteration in the patient's 
      medical therapy upon discharge from the observation unit, secondary to cardiac 
      dysrhythmia. There were 249 patients included with a median age of 52 with 60% 
      women. Fifteen percent of the patients were, subsequently, admitted to the hospital 
      for further evaluation of ischemia based on enzyme, ECG, and exercise testing 
      results. One patient with known Tachy-Brady syndrome was noted to have 1.5-2 s 
      pauses while sleeping, and discharged with instructions to hold beta blocker therapy 
      pending results of a continuous loop recorder. Of the remaining 248 patients, no 
      patient suffered a cardiac arrest, no patient was admitted to the hospital secondary 
      to cardiac dysrhythmia, and no alteration in a patient's medical therapy was made 
      secondary to cardiac dysrhythmia. No patient returned to the Emergency Department 
      within 72 h with cardiac arrest, acute dysrhythmia or acute myocardial infarction. 
      Although telemetry may be the standard of care in evaluating the patients with 
      suspected acute coronary syndromes, regardless of the probability of an acute 
      ischemic syndrome, in those patients with a normal or non diagnostic ECG and 
      resolved symptoms, routine cardiac monitoring is unnecessary.

AB  - Although multiple intraoperative cerebral blood flow (CBF) monitoring techniques are 
      currently available, a quantitative method that allows for continuous monitoring and 
      that can be easily integrated into the surgical workflow is still needed. Laser 
      speckle contrast imaging (LSCI) is an optical imaging technique with a high 
      spatiotemporal resolution that has been recently demonstrated as feasible and 
      effective for intraoperative monitoring of CBF during neurosurgical procedures. This 
      study demonstrates the impact of retrospective motion correction on the quantitative 
      analysis of intraoperatively acquired LSCI images. LSCI images were acquired through 
      a surgical microscope during brain tumor resection procedures from 10 patients under 
      baseline conditions and after a cortical stimulation in three of those patients. The 
      patient's electrocardiogram (ECG) was recorded during acquisition for postprocess 
      correction of pulsatile artifacts. Automatic image registration was retrospectively 
      performed to correct for tissue motion artifacts, and the performance of rigid and 
      nonrigid transformations was compared. In baseline cases, the original images had 
      [Formula: see text] noise across 16 regions of interest (ROIs). ECG filtering 
      moderately reduced the noise to [Formula: see text], while image registration 
      resulted in a further noise reduction of [Formula: see text]. Combined ECG filtering 
      and image registration significantly reduced the noise to [Formula: see text] 
      ([Formula: see text]). Using the combined motion correction, accuracy and 
      sensitivity to small changes in CBF were improved in cortical stimulation cases. 
      There was also excellent agreement between rigid and nonrigid registration methods 
      (15/16 ROIs with [Formula: see text] difference). Results from this study 
      demonstrate the importance of motion correction for improved visualization of CBF 
      changes in clinical LSCI images.

TI  - On the generalizability of ECG-based obstructive sleep apnea monitoring: merits and 
      limitations of the Apnea-ECG database.
PG  - 6022-6025

AB  - Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is a sleep disorder that affects a large 
      part of the population and the development of algorithms using cardiovascular 
      features for OSAS monitoring has been an extensively researched topic in the last 
      two decades. Several studies regarding automatic apneic event classification using 
      ECG derived features are based on the public Apnea-ECG database available on 
      PhysioNet. Although this database is an excellent starting point for apnea topic 
      investigations, in our study we show that algorithms for apneic-epochs 
      classification that are successfully trained on this database (sensitivity < 85%, 
      false detection rate <20%) perform poorly (sensitivity\textit<55%, false detection 
      rate < 40%) in other databases which include patients with a broader spectrum of 
      apneic events and sleep disorders. The reduced performance can be related to the 
      complexity of breathing events, the increased number of non-breathing related sleep 
      events, and the presence of non-OSAS sleep pathologies.

TI  - Promising effects of xanthine oxidase inhibition by allopurinol on autonomic heart 
      regulation estimated by heart rate variability (HRV) analysis in rats exposed to 
      hypoxia and hyperoxia.
PG  - e0192781
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0192781 [doi]
LID - e0192781
AB  - BACKGROUND: It has long been suggested that reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a 
      role in oxygen sensing via peripheral chemoreceptors, which would imply their 
      involvement in chemoreflex activation and autonomic regulation of heart rate. We 
      hypothesize that antioxidant affect neurogenic cardiovascular regulation through 
      activation of chemoreflex which results in increased control of sympathetic 
      mechanism regulating heart rhythm. Activity of xanthine oxidase (XO), which is among 
      the major endogenous sources of ROS in the rat has been shown to increase during 
      hypoxia promote oxidative stress. However, the mechanism of how XO inhibition 
      affects neurogenic regulation of heart rhythm is still unclear. AIM: The study aimed 
      to evaluate effects of allopurinol-driven inhibition of XO on autonomic heart 
      regulation in rats exposed to hypoxia followed by hyperoxia, using heart rate 
      variability (HRV) analysis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 16 conscious male Wistar rats (350 
      g): control-untreated (N = 8) and pretreated with Allopurinol-XO inhibitor (5 mg/kg, 
      followed by 50 mg/kg), administered intraperitoneally (N = 8), were exposed to 
      controlled hypobaric hypoxia (1h) in order to activate chemoreflex. The treatment 
      was followed by 1h hyperoxia (chemoreflex suppression). Time-series of 1024 
      RR-intervals were extracted from 4kHz ECG recording for heart rate variability (HRV) 
      analysis in order to calculate the following time-domain parameters: mean RR 
      interval (RRi), SDNN (standard deviation of all normal NN intervals), rMSSD (square 
      root of the mean of the squares of differences between adjacent NN intervals), 
      frequency-domain parameters (FFT method): TSP (total spectral power) as well as low 
      and high frequency band powers (LF and HF). At the end of experiment we used rat 
      plasma to evaluate enzymatic activity of XO and markers of oxidative stress: protein 
      carbonyl group and 8-isoprostane concentrations. Enzymatic activity of superoxide 
      dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) were measures in 
      erythrocyte lysates. RESULTS: Allopurinol reduced oxidative stress which was the 
      result of hypoxia/hyperoxia, as shown by decreased 8-isoprostane plasma 
      concentration. XO inhibition did not markedly influence HRV parameters in standard 
      normoxia. However, during hypoxia, as well as hyperoxia, allopurinol administration 
      resulted in a significant increase of autonomic control upon the heart as shown by 
      increased SDNN and TSP, with an increased vagal contribution (increased rMSSD and 
      HF), whereas sympathovagal indexes (LF/HF, SDNN/rMSSD) remained unchanged. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Observed regulatory effects of XO inhibition did not confirm 
      preliminary hypothesis which suggested that an antioxidant such as allopurinol might 
      activate chemoreflex resulting in augmented sympathetic discharge to the heart. The 
      HRV regulatory profile of XO inhibition observed during hypoxia as well as 
      post-hypoxic hyperoxia corresponds to reported reduced risk of sudden cardiovascular 
      events. Therefore our data provide a new argument for therapeutical use of 
      allopurinol in hypoxic conditions.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Electrocardiogram (ECG) is an important diagnostic tool 
      for the diagnosis of heart disorders. Useful features and well-designed 
      classification method are crucial for automatic diagnosis. However, most of the 
      contributions were in single lead or two-lead ECG signal and only features from 
      single lead were used to classify the ECG beats. In this paper, a cascaded 
      classification system is proposed to extract features and classify heartbeats in 
      order to improve the performance of ECG beat classification via multi-lead ECG. 
      METHODS: In contrast with most of the literatures, ten signal features were chosen 
      and run on each of the 12 leads separately. Based on these features, we developed a 
      novel feature fusion method combining information from all available leads, and then 
      implemented a cascaded classifier utilizing random forest (RF) and multilayer 
      perceptron (MLP). Besides, in order to reduce the feature space dimension, principal 
      component analysis (PCA) was applied in the method. MATERIALS: Four open source 
      databases including MIT-BIH Arrythmia Database, QT Database, MIT-BIH 
      Supraventricular Arrhythmia Database and St. Petersburg Institute of Cardiological 
      Technics 12-lead Arrhythmia Database (INCART Database) were used in this work. These 
      four databases are different in classes of beats, volume of dataset, number of 
      individual volunteers. Except INCART database, in which the recording format is 
      12-lead, the other three databases consist of 2-lead recordings. Above all, they all 
      have annotations for every single beat including the type of each beat. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Extensive experimental results shown that the average accuracy achieved 99.3%, 
      99.8%, 97.6% and 99.6% on four databases respectively. Compared with most 
      state-of-the-art methods, our work has better performance and strong generalization 
      capability.

PG  - 6176-6179
LID - 10.1109/EMBC.2019.8856711 [doi]
AB  - In this work, we analyze brain-heart interactions during different mental states 
      computing mutual information (MI) between the dynamic activity of different 
      physiological systems. In 18 healthy subjects monitored in a relaxed resting state 
      and during a mental arithmetic and a serious game task, multichannel EEG, one lead 
      ECG, respiration and blood volume pulse were collected via wireless non-invasive 
      biosensors. From these signals, synchronous 300-second time series were extracted 
      measuring brain activity via the δ, θ, α, and β EEG power, and activity of the body 
      district via the ECG R-R interval η, the respiratory amplitude ρ and the pulse 
      arrival time π. MI was computed using a linear estimator: (i) between {η,ρ,π} and 
      {δ,θ,α,β}, to measure overall brain-body interactions; (ii) between each time series 
      and the others of the same district, to measure information shared within a 
      district; and (iii) between each time series of a district and all series of the 
      other district, to evaluate individual contributions to the information shared 
      between brain and body. Results document the existence of statistically significant 
      brain-body interactions, with high MI values involving mainly the η body dynamics 
      and the δ and β brain dynamics. State-dependent variations were mostly relevant to 
      the MI of the brain system involving δ, θ, α during mental arithmetic, and α and β 
      during serious game. Thus, MI can be useful to detect correlated activity within and 
      between brain and body systems monitored simultaneously during different mental 
      states.

TI  - Quantification of cardio-respiratory interactions in healthy children during 
      night-time sleep using joint symbolic dynamics.
PG  - 1459-62
LID - 10.1109/IEMBS.2011.6090338 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this paper was to study interactions between R-R intervals and 
      respiratory phases in healthy children during night-time sleep using a novel 
      technique based on joint symbolic dynamics. We investigated overnight 
      polysomnography data of 40 healthy children. The R-R time series were extracted from 
      electrocardiograms (ECG) and respiratory phases were obtained from abdominal sensors 
      using the Hilbert transform. Both the series were transformed into ternary symbol 
      vectors based on the changes between two successive R-R intervals or respiratory 
      phases, respectively. Subsequently, words of length '2' were formed and the 
      correspondence between words of the two series for each sleep stage was determined 
      to quantify cardio-respiratory interaction. We found a significantly higher 
      percentage of similarity in the joint symbolic dynamics of R-R intervals and 
      respiratory phases during slow-wave (SW) sleep compared to any other sleep stage. 
      There was, however, no significant effect of age, gender or BMI on 
      cardio-respiratory interaction. In conclusion, joint symbolic dynamics provides a 
      novel efficient technique for the analysis of cardio-respiratory interaction.

PG  - 2707-2710
LID - 10.1109/EMBC.2018.8512761 [doi]
AB  - Heart disease classification based on electrocardiogram(ECG) signal has become a 
      priority topic in the diagnosis of heart diseases because it can be obtained with a 
      simple diagnostic tool of low cost. Since early detection of heart disease can 
      enable us to ease the treatment as well as save people's lives, accurate detection 
      of heart disease using ECG is very important. In this paper, we propose a 
      classification method of heart diseases based on ECG by adopting a machine learning 
      method, called Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), which is a state-of-the-art technique 
      analyzing time series sequences in deep learning. As suitable data preprocessing, we 
      also utilize symbolic aggregate approximation (SAX) to improve the accuracy. Our 
      experiment results show that our approach not only achieves significantly better 
      accuracy but also classifies heart diseases correctly in smaller response time than 
      baseline techniques.

TI  - A decision support system and rule-based algorithm to augment the human 
      interpretation of the 12-lead electrocardiogram.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The 12-lead Electrocardiogram (ECG) has been used to detect cardiac 
      abnormalities in the same format for more than 70years. However, due to the complex 
      nature of 12-lead ECG interpretation, there is a significant cognitive workload 
      required from the interpreter. This complexity in ECG interpretation often leads to 
      errors in diagnosis and subsequent treatment. We have previously reported on the 
      development of an ECG interpretation support system designed to augment the human 
      interpretation process. This computerised decision support system has been named 
      'Interactive Progressive based Interpretation' (IPI). In this study, a decision 
      support algorithm was built into the IPI system to suggest potential diagnoses based 
      on the interpreter's annotations of the 12-lead ECG. We hypothesise semi-automatic 
      interpretation using a digital assistant can be an optimal man-machine model for ECG 
      interpretation. OBJECTIVES: To improve interpretation accuracy and reduce missed 
      co-abnormalities. METHODS: The Differential Diagnoses Algorithm (DDA) was developed 
      using web technologies where diagnostic ECG criteria are defined in an open storage 
      format, Javascript Object Notation (JSON), which is queried using a rule-based 
      reasoning algorithm to suggest diagnoses. To test our hypothesis, a counterbalanced 
      trial was designed where subjects interpreted ECGs using the conventional approach 
      and using the IPI+DDA approach. RESULTS: A total of 375 interpretations were 
      collected. The IPI+DDA approach was shown to improve diagnostic accuracy by 8.7% 
      (although not statistically significant, p-value=0.1852), the IPI+DDA suggested the 
      correct interpretation more often than the human interpreter in 7/10 cases (varying 
      statistical significance). Human interpretation accuracy increased to 70% when seven 
      suggestions were generated. CONCLUSION: Although results were not found to be 
      statistically significant, we found; 1) our decision support tool increased the 
      number of correct interpretations, 2) the DDA algorithm suggested the correct 
      interpretation more often than humans, and 3) as many as 7 computerised diagnostic 
      suggestions augmented human decision making in ECG interpretation. Statistical 
      significance may be achieved by expanding sample size.

TI  - Life-threatening arrhythmia verification in ICU patients using the joint 
      cardiovascular dynamical model and a Bayesian filter.
PG  - 2748-57
LID - 10.1109/TBME.2010.2093898 [doi]
AB  - In this paper, a novel nonlinear joint dynamical model is presented, which is based 
      on a set of coupled ordinary differential equations of motion and a Gaussian mixture 
      model representation of pulsatile cardiovascular (CV) signals. In the proposed 
      framework, the joint interdependences of CV signals are incorporated by assuming a 
      unique angular frequency that controls the limit cycle of the heart rate. Moreover, 
      the time consequence of CV signals is controlled by the same phase parameter that 
      results in the space dimensionality reduction. These joint equations together with 
      linear assignments to observation are further used in the Kalman filter structure 
      for estimation and tracking. Moreover, we propose a measure of signal fidelity by 
      monitoring the covariance matrix of the innovation signals throughout the filtering 
      procedure. Five categories of life-threatening arrhythmias were verified by 
      simultaneously tracking the signal fidelity and the polar representation of the CV 
      signal estimations. We analyzed data from Physiobank multiparameter databases (MIMIC 
      I and II). Performance evaluation results demonstrated that the sensitivity of the 
      detection ranges over 93.50% and 100.00%. In particular, the addition of more CV 
      signals improved the positive predictivity of the proposed method to 99.27% for the 
      total arrhythmic types. The method was also used for false arrhythmia suppression 
      issued by ICU monitors, with an overall false suppression rate reduced from 42.3% to 
      9.9%. In addition, false critical ECG arrhythmia alarm rates were found to be, on 
      average, 42.3%, with individual rates varying between 16.7% and 86.5%. The results 
      illustrate that the method can contribute to, and enhance the performance of 
      clinical life-threatening arrhythmia detection.

AB  - Rapid ventricular pacing rates induces two types of beats following pacing 
      cessation: recovery cycle length (RCL) prolongation (overdrive suppression) and RCL 
      shortening (overdrive excitation). The goals of this study were to compare common 
      experimental protocols for studying triggered activity in whole-heart preparations 
      and differentiate between recovery beats using a new methodology. Post-pacing 
      recovery beat cycle length (RCL) and QRS were normalized to pre-paced R-R and QRS 
      intervals and analyzed using a K-means clustering algorithm. Control hearts only 
      produced suppressed beats: RCL ratio increased with rapid pacing (25 ± 4.0%, n = 10) 
      without changing QRS duration. Rapid pacing during hypercalcemia + hypothermia (5.5 
      mM and 34°C) produced significantly earlier excited beats (53 ± 14%, n = 5) with 
      wider QRS durations (58 ± 6.3%, n = 5) than suppressed beats. Digoxin + hypothermia 
      (0.75 μM) produced the most excited beats with significantly earlier RCL (44 ± 3.2%, 
      n = 6) and wider QRS (60 ± 3.1%, n = 6) ratios relative to suppressed beats. 
      Increasing pacing further shortened RCL (30 ± 7.8%, n = 6). In a prospective study, 
      TTX (100 nM) increased RCL ratio (15 ± 6.0%, n = 10) without changing the QRS 
      duration of excited beats. The algorithm was compared to a cross-correlation 
      analysis with 93% sensitivity and 94% specificity. This ECG based algorithm 
      distinguishes between triggered and automatic activity.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: In this paper, the contribution of distance-based features to automatic 
      sleep stage classification is investigated. The potency of these features is 
      analyzed individually and in combination with 48 conventionally used features. 
      METHODS: The distance-based set consists of 32 features extracted by calculating 
      Itakura, Itakura-Saito and COSH distances of autoregressive and spectral 
      coefficients of Electrocardiography (EEG) (C(3)-A(2)), Left EOG, Chin EMG and ECG 
      signals. All the evaluations are performed on three feature sets: distance-based, 
      conventional and total (combined distance based and conventional). Six ranking 
      methods were used to find the top features with the highest discrimination ability 
      in each set. The ranked feature lists were evaluated using k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN), 
      Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Decision-tree-based multi-SVM (DSVM) 
      classifiers for five sleep stages including Wake, REM, N1, N2 and N3. Furthermore, 
      the ability of distance-based and conventional features to discriminate between each 
      pair of sleep stages was evaluated using t-test, a hypothesis testing method. 
      RESULTS: Distance-based features occupied 25% of top-ranked features. Simulation 
      results showed that using distance-based features together with conventional 
      features can lead to an enhancement of accuracy. The best classification accuracy 
      (85.5%) was achieved by DSVM classifier and 13 features selected by mRMR-MID and 
      normalized with Min-Max method for total feature set, where two of them were from 
      the distance-based feature set. The t-test results show that distance-based features 
      outperform conventional features in discriminating between N1 and REM stages that is 
      usually a challenge for classification systems. CONCLUSION: Distance-based features 
      have a positive contribution to sleep stage classification, including enhancement of 
      accuracy and better REM-N1 discrimination ability. SIGNIFICANCE: The main motivation 
      for this work was to evaluate new features to characterize each sleep stage in such 
      a way that extracted features were more powerful than conventional features, to 
      distinguish sleep stages from each other, and to improve classifiers accuracy.

AB  - The heart rate variability (HRV) signal derived from the ECG is a beat-to-beat 
      record of RR intervals and is, as a time series, irregularly sampled. It is common 
      engineering practice to resample this record, typically at 4 Hz, onto a regular time 
      axis for analysis in advance of time domain filtering and spectral analysis based on 
      the DFT. However, it is recognised that resampling introduces noise and frequency 
      bias. The present work describes the implementation of a time-varying filter using a 
      smoothing priors approach based on a Gaussian process model, which does not require 
      data to be regular in time. Its output is directly compatible with the Lomb-Scargle 
      algorithm for power density estimation. A web-based demonstration is available over 
      the Internet for exemplar data. The MATLAB (MathWorks Inc.) code can be downloaded 
      as open source.

TI  - [Atrial fibrillation in medical intensive care unit patients: characteristics and 
      consequences].
PG  - 520-3, 564
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is scarcity of data on atrial fibrillation (AF) prevalence and 
      outcomes in critically ill patients admitted to the non-cardiac Intensive Care Unit 
      (ICU). AIM: The purpose of our study was to prospectively assess the incidence, risk 
      factors and prognosis of new onset atrial fibrillation in a medical non-cardiac ICU 
      population. METHODS: A prospective single center observational study was conducted 
      in an 8-bed adult Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU). The patients at the MICU were 
      continuously monitored throughout their stay, once an irregularly irregular rhythm 
      was recorded, a confirmative 12-leads ECG was performed and the incidence, duration 
      of the atrial fibrillation and clinical signs of the patient were logged into the 
      computerized patient file. RESULTS: A total of 209 patients were included in the 
      study; 23 of these patients developed AF during the hospital stay. Out of the 209 
      patients, 26% died during the period of hospitalization. There were a few 
      significant differences between the AF group and the non-AF group including age (67 
      vs. 49, p < 0.001), proportion of Arab Bedouins (4% vs. 28%, p = 0.01), prevalence 
      of coronary heart disease (39% vs. 10%, p < 0.001), paroxysmal atrial fibrillation 
      (52% vs. 3%, p < 0.001), hypertension (70% vs. 31%, p < 0.001 and dyslipidemia 166% 
      vs. 24%, p < 0.001). The APACHE II scores were similar in both groups. In the AF 
      group, there were more patients with sepsis at admission compared with the non-AF 
      group. Age, length of stay, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) and dyslipidemia 
      were independent factors for the AF development. AF occurrence adjusted for 
      APACHE-II score was not a significant predictor of death during hospitalization (OR 
      = 1.55, p = 0.38). CONCLUSIONS: The development of AF is more prevalent in patients 
      with PAF. Development of AF was not found to be an independent mortality risk 
      factor.

TI  - Quantitative analysis of cardiac arrhythmias.
PG  - 1-43
AB  - Quantitative analysis of cardiac arrhythmias has been the subject of intensive 
      research during the last 10 years. Several systems have been designed to help in the 
      processing of cardiac signals: single or multiple lead electrocardiograms (ECG), 
      electrograms from intracardiac catheters, esophageal recordings, etc. The main 
      objective of these developments was oriented toward positive identification of 
      arrhythmias or rhythm-disturbance counts to imitate the cardiologist's 
      interpretation in contexts such as routing ECG and ambulatory recordings. However, 
      these systems were mainly measurement tools aimed at extracting auricular and 
      ventricular depolarization timings plus gross morphology description. The domain of 
      morphology analysis of beat-to-beat auricular depolarization on ECG has never been 
      highly active due to poor signal conditions. For routine ECG, automatic 
      interpretation was set as an objective to complement computer-assisted ECG 
      interpretation of conduction problems (i.e., morphology analysis of a representative 
      beat extracted or averaged from the dominant rhythm). The limitations of rhythm 
      interpretation in this context are well known. In the ambulatory ECG context, the 
      analysis procedures are relatively simple and are often summarized as trivial counts 
      describing, most exclusively, the ventricular arrhythmic behavior of the heart over 
      a relatively long duration. Waveform-detection and measurement have been the 
      bottleneck of advancement in arrhythmia analysis since highly reliable detection of 
      events on a beat-to-beat basis are necessary to perform a valid analysis. Rare 
      approaches have proposed probabilistic definition of event detection. The present 
      review puts emphasis on the potential of several methods which have been 
      demonstrated as powerful in identifying short- or long-duration heartbeat patterns, 
      mode of heartbeat initiation, mode of heartbeat coupling, etc. Globally, these 
      methods are referred to as time series analysis, modeling of rhythm patterns, 
      simulation, and pattern recognition. A delay in the advancement of the study of 
      arrhythmogenesis and limiting the analysis of arrhythmias to textbook descriptions 
      is not justified when put in perspective of the potential of implementing powerful 
      techniques which have been more or less neglected or used in a narrow way.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Electrocardiogram (ECG) is one of the most important tools 
      for assessing cardiac function and detecting potential heart problems. However, most 
      of the current ECG report records remain on the paper, which makes it difficult to 
      preserve and analyze the data. Moreover, paper records could result in the loss 
      significant data, which brings inconvenience to the subsequent clinical diagnosis or 
      artificial intelligence-assisted heart health diagnosis. Taking digital pictures is 
      an intuitive way of preserving these files and can be done simply using smartphones 
      or any other devices with cameras. However, these real scene ECG images often have 
      some image noise that hinders signal extraction. How to eliminate image noise and 
      extract ECG binary image automatically from the noisy and low-quality real scene 
      images of ECG reports is the first problem to be solved in this paper. Next, QRS 
      recognition is implemented on the extracted binary images to determine key points of 
      ECG signals. 1D digital ECG signal is also extracted for accessing the exact values 
      of the extracted points. In light of these tasks, an automatic digital ECG signal 
      extraction and normal QRS recognition from real scene ECG images is proposed in this 
      paper. METHODS: The normal QRS recognition approach for real scene ECG images in 
      this paper consists of two steps: ECG binary image extraction from ECG images using 
      a new two-layer hierarchical method, and the subsequent QRS recognition based on a 
      novel feature-fusing method. ECG binary image extraction is implemented using 
      sub-channel filters followed by an adaptive filtering algorithm. According to the 
      ratio between pixel and real value of ECG binary image, 1D digital ECG signal is 
      obtained. The normal QRS recognition includes three main steps: establishment of 
      candidate point sets, feature fusion extraction, and QRS recognition. Two datasets 
      are introduced for evaluation including a real scene ECG images dataset and the 
      public Non-Invasive Fetal Electrocardiogram Database (FECG). RESULTS: Through the 
      experiment on real scene ECG image, the F(1) score for Q, R, S detection is 0.841, 
      0.992, and 0.891, respectively. The evaluation on the public FECG dataset also 
      proves the robustness of our algorithm, where F(1) score for R is 0.992 (0.996 for 
      thoracic lead) and 0.988 for thoracic S wave. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed method in 
      this article is a promising tool for automatically extracting digital ECG signals 
      and detecting QRS complex in real scene ECG images with normal QRS.

AB  - Analysis of biomedical signals can yield invaluable information for prognosis, 
      diagnosis, therapy evaluation, risk assessment, and disease prevention which is 
      often recorded as short time series data that challenges existing complexity 
      classification algorithms such as Shannon entropy (SE) and other techniques. The 
      purpose of this study was to improve previously developed multiscale entropy (MSE) 
      technique by incorporating nearest-neighbor moving-average kernel, which can be used 
      for analysis of nonlinear and non-stationary short time series physiological data. 
      The approach was tested for robustness with respect to noise analysis using 
      simulated sinusoidal and ECG waveforms. Feasibility of MSE to discriminate between 
      normal sinus rhythm (NSR) and atrial fibrillation (AF) was tested on a single-lead 
      ECG. In addition, the MSE algorithm was applied to identify pivot points of rotors 
      that were induced in ex vivo isolated rabbit hearts. The improved MSE technique 
      robustly estimated the complexity of the signal compared to that of SE with various 
      noises, discriminated NSR and AF on single-lead ECG, and precisely identified the 
      pivot points of ex vivo rotors by providing better contrast between the rotor core 
      and the peripheral region. The improved MSE technique can provide efficient 
      complexity analysis of variety of nonlinear and nonstationary short-time biomedical 
      signals.

AB  - The thin skin of preterm babies is easily damaged by adhesive electrodes, tapes, 
      chest drains and needle-marks. The scars caused could be disfiguring or disabling to 
      10% of preterm newborns. Capacitive sensors present an attractive option for 
      pervasively monitoring neonatal ECG, and can be embedded in a support system or even 
      a garment worn by the neonate. This could improve comfort and reduce pain aiding 
      better recovery as well as avoiding the scars caused by adhesive electrodes. In this 
      work, we investigate the use of an array of capacitive sensors unobtrusively 
      embedded in a mattress and used in a clinical environment for 15 preterm neonates. 
      We also describe the analysis framework including the fusion of information from all 
      sensors to provide a more accurate ECG signal. We propose a channel selection 
      strategy as well as a method using physiological information to obtain a reliable 
      ECG signal. When sensor coverage is well attained, results for both instantaneous 
      heart rate and ECG signal shape analysis are very encouraging. The study also 
      provides several insights on important factors affecting the results. These include 
      the effect of textile type, number of layers, interferences (e.g. people walking 
      by), motion severity and interventions. Incorporating this knowledge in the design 
      of a capacitive sensing system would be crucial in ensuring that these sensors 
      provide a reliable ECG signal when embedded in a neonatal support system.

TI  - Myocardial infarction in intensive care units: A systematic review of diagnosis and 
      treatment.
PG  - 314-325
LID - 10.1177/1751143716656642 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Patients in the intensive care unit are vulnerable to myocardial 
      injury from a variety of causes, both ischaemic and non-ischaemic. It is challenging 
      for ICU clinicians to apply the conventional guidance concerning diagnosis and 
      treatment. We conducted this review to examine the evidence concerning diagnosis and 
      treatment of myocardial infarction in the ICU. METHODS: A systematic review was 
      performed to identify relevant studies. RESULTS: 19 studies concerning use of ECG, 
      cardiac enzymes, echocardiography and angiography were identified. 4 studies 
      considered treatment of myocardial infarction. CONCLUSIONS: Regular 12 lead ECG or 
      12 lead ECG monitoring is more sensitive than 2 lead monitoring, regular measurement 
      of cardiac enzymes is more sensitive than when provoked by symptoms. Coronary 
      angiography rarely identifies treatable lesions, without regional wall motion 
      abnormality on echocardiography. Evidence relating to treatment was limited. A 
      potential strategy to diagnose myocardial infarctions in the ICU is proposed.

TI  - Statistical feature extraction for artifact removal from concurrent fMRI-EEG 
      recordings.
PG  - 2073-87
LID - 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.10.042 [doi]
AB  - We propose a set of algorithms for sequentially removing artifacts related to MRI 
      gradient switching and cardiac pulsations from electroencephalography (EEG) data 
      recorded during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Special emphasis is 
      directed upon the use of statistical metrics and methods for the extraction and 
      selection of features that characterize gradient and pulse artifacts. To remove 
      gradient artifacts, we use channel-wise filtering based on singular value 
      decomposition (SVD). To remove pulse artifacts, we first decompose data into 
      temporally independent components and then select a compact cluster of components 
      that possess sustained high mutual information with the electrocardiogram (ECG). 
      After the removal of these components, the time courses of remaining components are 
      filtered by SVD to remove the temporal patterns phase-locked to the cardiac timing 
      markers derived from the ECG. The filtered component time courses are then inversely 
      transformed into multi-channel EEG time series free of pulse artifacts. Evaluation 
      based on a large set of simultaneous EEG-fMRI data obtained during a variety of 
      behavioral tasks, sensory stimulations and resting conditions showed excellent data 
      quality and robust performance attainable with the proposed methods. These 
      algorithms have been implemented as a Matlab-based toolbox made freely available for 
      public access and research use.

TI  - Implantable loop recorders for assessment of syncope: increased diagnostic yield and 
      less adverse outcomes with the latest generation devices.
PG  - 421-9
AB  - AIM: Aim of the study was to compare the diagnostic yield of implantable loop 
      recorders (ILR) of two successive generations for the assessment of syncope. 
      METHODS: Data on patients who had undergone ILR implantation for unexplained syncope 
      in four Italian public hospitals were retrospectively acquired from the Medtronic 
      Clinical Service database. After implantation, routine follow-up examinations were 
      performed every 90 days, while urgent examinations were carried out in the event of 
      syncope recurrence. RESULTS: The following findings were regarded as diagnostic: ECG 
      documentation of a syncope recurrence; documentation of any of the arrhythmias 
      listed by the current guidelines as diagnostic findings even if asymptomatic. 
      Between November 2002 and March 2010, 107 patients received an ILR (40 Medtronic 
      Reveal® Plus; 67 Medtronic Reveal® DX/XT) and underwent at least one follow-up 
      examination. Diagnoses were made in 7 (17.5%) and 24 (35.8%) (P=0.043) patients, 
      with a median time of 228 and 65 days, respectively. Three (42.9%) and 21 (87.5%) 
      (P=0.029) diagnoses were based on automatically detected events, while adverse 
      outcomes occurred in 6 and in 1 (P=0.01) patients, respectively. CONCLUSION: Our 
      results show that the new-generation device offer a higher diagnostic yield, mainly 
      as a result of its improved automatic detection function, and is associated with 
      fewer adverse outcomes.

TI  - Improving the quality of care for patients with or at risk of atrial fibrillation: 
      an improvement initiative in UK general practices.
PG  - e001086
LID - 10.1136/openhrt-2019-001086 [doi]
LID - e001086
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a growing problem internationally and a 
      recognised cause of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The London borough of 
      Hounslow has a lower than expected prevalence of AF, suggesting poor detection and 
      associated undertreatment. To improve AF diagnosis and management, a quality 
      improvement (QI) initiative was set up in 48 general practices in Hounslow. We aimed 
      to study whether there was evidence of a change in AF diagnosis and management in 
      Hounslow following implementation of interventions in this QI initiative. METHODS: 
      Using the general practice information system (SystmOne), data were retrospectively 
      collected for 415 626 patients, who were actively registered at a Hounslow practice 
      between 1 January 2011 and 31 August 2018. Process, outcome and balancing measures 
      were analysed using statistical process control and interrupted time series 
      regression methods. The baseline period was from 1 January 2011 to 30 September 2014 
      and the intervention period was from 1 October 2014 to 31 August 2018. RESULTS: When 
      comparing the baseline to the intervention period, (1) the rate of new AF diagnoses 
      increased by 27% (relative risk 1.27; 95% CI 1.05 to 1.52; p<0.01); (2) ECG tests 
      done for patients aged 60 and above increased; (3) CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc and HAS-BLED 
      risk assessments within 30 days of AF diagnosis increased from 1.7% to 19% and 0.2% 
      to 8.1%, respectively; (4) among those at higher risk of stroke, anticoagulation 
      prescription within 30 days of AF diagnosis increased from 31% to 63% while 
      prescription of antiplatelet monotherapy within the same time period decreased from 
      17% to 7.1%; and (5) average CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc and HAS-BLED risk scores did not 
      change. CONCLUSION: Implementation of interventions in the Hounslow QI initiative 
      coincided with improved AF diagnosis and management. Areas with perceived 
      underdetection of AF should consider similar interventions and methodology.

TI  - Effects of Orthostatism and Hemodialysis on Mean Heart Period and Fractal Heart Rate 
      Properties of Chronic Renal Failure Patients.
PG  - 1026-1034
LID - 10.1111/aor.12887 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this work was to evaluate the short-term fractal index (α(1) ) of heart 
      rate variability (HRV) in chronic renal failure (CRF) patients by identifying the 
      effects of orthostatism and hemodialysis (HD), and by evaluating the correlation 
      between α(1) and the mean RR interval from sinus beats (meanNN). HRV time series 
      were derived from ECG data of 19 CRF patients and 20 age-matched healthy subjects 
      obtained at supine and orthostatic positions (lasting 5 min each). Data from CRF 
      patients were collected before and after HD. α(1) was calculated from each time 
      series and compared by analysis of variance. Pearson's correlations between meanNN 
      and α(1) were calculated using the data from both positions by considering three 
      groups: healthy subjects, CRF before HD and CRF after HD. At supine position, α(1) 
      of CRF patients after HD (1.17 ± 0.30) was larger (P < 0.05) than in healthy 
      subjects (0.89 ± 0.28) but not before HD (1.10 ± 0.34). α(1) increased (P < 0.05) in 
      response to orthostatism in healthy subjects (1.29 ± 0.26) and CRF patients after HD 
      (1.34 ± 0.31), but not before HD (1.25 ± 0.37). Whereas α(1) was correlated 
      (P < 0.05) with the meanNN of healthy subjects (r = -0.562) and CRF patients after 
      HD (r = -0.388), no significance in CRF patients before HD was identified 
      (r = 0.003). Multiple regression analysis confirmed that α(1) was mainly predicted 
      by the orthostatic position (in all groups) and meanNN (healthy subjects and 
      patients after HD), showing no association with the renal disease condition in 
      itself. In conclusion, as in healthy subjects, α(1) of CRF patients correlates with 
      meanNN after HD (indicating a more irregular-like HRV behavior at slower heart 
      rates). This suggests that CRF patients with stable blood pressure preserve a 
      regulatory adaptability despite a shifted setting point of the heart period (i.e., 
      higher heart rate) in comparison with healthy subjects.

TI  - [Circadian variations of sinus rate in subjects with normal or pathological sinus 
      node (author's transl)].
PG  - 1211-8
AB  - Circadian variation of sinus rate (SR) is well described in subjects with normal 
      sinus node (SN). On the other hand there are on data in literature concerning the SR 
      daily variations in patients with SN disfunction. In order to clarify this problem 
      we studied the SR circadian variation in normal subjects (12, and in patients with 
      intermittent bradycardia (11), persistent bradycardia (9) and intermittent 2:1 
      seno-atrial block (7). SR was recorded utilizing ECG Holter monitoring. By 
      histograms obtained every two hours, modal, maximum and minimum SR were evaluated. 
      Time series were analyzed with a computer program for cosinor method. In the 
      patients with normal SN, circadian periodicity in SR was confirmed with acrophase at 
      1626 (maximum SR), 1638 (minimum SR) and 1631 (SR mode), respectively. In patients 
      with intermittent bradycardia a circadian rhythm was detected only in minimum SR 
      (acrophase 1651) and in SR mode (acrophase: 1631). No statistically significant 
      circadian variations of the 3 parameters of SR were observed in patients with both 
      persistent bradycardia and sinoatrial block. These data suggest that: - the 
      disappearance of circadian periodicity is proportional to the severity of SN 
      dysfunction; - the patients with intermittent bradycardia show a more normal 
      behavior at low rates than at high ones; - the disappearance of circadian rhythm in 
      patients with marked SN disfunction can be related to SN intrinsic involvement 
      and/or autonomic nervous system disfunction.

TI  - Forehead reflectance photoplethysmography to monitor heart rate: preliminary results 
      from neonatal patients.
PG  - 881-93
LID - 10.1088/0967-3334/35/5/881 [doi]
AB  - Around 5%-10% of newborn babies require some form of resuscitation at birth and 
      heart rate (HR) is the best guide of efficacy. We report the development and first 
      trial of a device that continuously monitors neonatal HR, with a view to deployment 
      in the delivery room to guide newborn resuscitation. The device uses forehead 
      reflectance photoplethysmography (PPG) with modulated light and lock-in detection. 
      Forehead fixation has numerous advantages including ease of sensor placement, whilst 
      perfusion at the forehead is better maintained in comparison to the extremities. 
      Green light (525 nm) was used, in preference to the more usual red or infrared 
      wavelengths, to optimize the amplitude of the pulsatile signal. Experimental results 
      are presented showing simultaneous PPG and electrocardiogram (ECG) HRs from babies 
      (n = 77), gestational age 26-42 weeks, on a neonatal intensive care unit. In babies 
      ⩾32 weeks gestation, the median reliability was 97.7% at ±10 bpm and the limits of 
      agreement (LOA) between PPG and ECG were +8.39 bpm and -8.39 bpm. In babies <32 
      weeks gestation, the median reliability was 94.8% at ±10 bpm and the LOA were +11.53 
      bpm and -12.01 bpm. Clinical evaluation during newborn deliveries is now underway.

TI  - Irregularity test for very short electrocardiogram (ECG) signals as a method for 
      predicting a successful defibrillation in patients with ventricular fibrillation.
PG  - 145-51
AB  - A significant proportion of patients with ventricular fibrillation (VF) can only be 
      defibrillated after a period of chest compressions and ventilation before the 
      defibrillation attempt. In these patients, unsuccessful defibrillations increase the 
      duration of heart arrest and reduce the possibility of a successful resuscitation, 
      which could be avoided if a reliable prediction for the success of defibrillation 
      could be made. A new method is presented for estimating the irregularity in very 
      short electrocardiographic (ECG) recordings that enables the prediction of a 
      successful defibrillation in patients with VF. This method is based on a recently 
      developed determinism test for very short time series. A slight modification shows 
      that the method can be used to determine relative differences in irregularity of the 
      studied signals. In particular, ECG recordings of VF from patients who could be 
      successfully defibrillated are characterized by a higher level of irregularity, 
      indicating a chaotic nature of the dynamics of the heart, which is in agreement with 
      previous studies on long ECG recordings showing that cardiac chaos was prevalent in 
      healthy heart, whereas in severe congestive heart failure, a decrease in the chaotic 
      behavior was observed.

TI  - AR identification and spectral estimate applied to the R-R interval measurements.
PG  - 201-15
AB  - The methods of identification and spectral estimate are applied to the tachogram, 
      i.e. the time series constituted by the cycle-by-cycle R-R interval durations 
      measured on the ECG signal from cardiological patients in ambulatory rehabilitation 
      training after episodes of myocardial infarction or ischemic disease. The Batch 
      Least Squares Method is applied to identify the series as an AR process of 5th 
      order. The whiteness test and Rissanen's optimization criterion are also fulfilled. 
      The clinical information is in this way highly compressed in the pole diagram and in 
      the Maximum Entropy Spectrum (MES) estimated on the basis of the AR coefficients. 
      The experimental results in a restricted set of patients confirm the feasibility of 
      new instrumentation design criteria for non-conventional R-R intervals 
      parametrisation, successive diagnostic classification and beat prediction. Finally, 
      some preliminary considerations about the capabilities of the introduced methods put 
      into evidence the role of computerized techniques in recognizing the fundamental 
      patterns of physiopathological heart rate variability, which the usual conventional 
      methods of ECG analysis are not able to detect in a reliable way.

TI  - New approach to studies on ECG dynamics: extraction and analyses of QRS complex 
      irregularity time series.
PG  - 467-73
AB  - How to extract information intensively from ECGs for the diagnosis of cardiovascular 
      diseases and assessment of heart function is a topical subject. Using a method based 
      on the wavelet transform to calculate the irregularity of the QRS complex, which may 
      relate to inotropy, the QRS complex irregularity time series is successfully 
      extracted from original ECG signals. This provides a new approach to studies of ECG 
      dynamics. With the help of non-linear dynamics theory, the QRS complex irregularity 
      time series of eight subjects from the MIT/BIH arrhythmia database are studied 
      qualitatively and quantitatively, and the characteristics of ECG dynamics are 
      analysed extensively. The power spectrum, phase portrait, correlation dimension, 
      largest Lyapunov exponent, time-dependent divergence exponent and complexity measure 
      all verify the fact that ECG dynamics are dominated by an underlying 5-6-dimensional 
      non-linear chaotic system, whose complexity measure is about 0.7. The QRS complex 
      irregularity time series contains abundant information about all parts of the heart 
      and the regulation of the autonomic nervous system, and so further analyses are of 
      great potential theoretical and clinical significance to patho-physiology studies 
      and ambulatory monitoring.

TI  - Fetal ECG extraction from time-varying and low-rank noninvasive maternal abdominal 
      recordings.
PG  - 125008
LID - 10.1088/1361-6579/aaef5d [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Noninvasive fetal electrocardiography is emerging as a low-cost and 
      high-accuracy technology for fetal cardiac monitoring. Signal processing techniques 
      have been used over the past fifty years in this domain. The current major 
      challenges of this domain, addressed in this study are (1) fetal electrocardiogram 
      (fECG) extraction from few numbers of maternal abdominal channels in low 
      signal-to-noise ratios; (2) online fECG extraction; (3) automatic and online signal 
      quality assessment and channel selection; and (4) accurate and robust fetal R-peak 
      detection and ECG parameter extraction. APPROACH: Based on the theory of 
      cyclostationarity, auxiliary maternal ECG channel(s) are synthetically constructed 
      and augmented with the input channels. The augmented data are used to develop a 
      robust multichannel source separation algorithm for online/offline fECG extraction, 
      from as few as a single channel, and an accurate fetal R-peak detector using a 
      two-pass matched filter. Several robust signal quality indexes (SQI) and a voting 
      strategy are also proposed for automatic fetal signal quality assessment. MAIN 
      RESULTS: It is shown that the fECG and the fetal R-peaks can be accurately extracted 
      from standard online available datasets, for which classical source separation 
      methods (requiring many channels) had previously failed. The signal quality indexes 
      fully automate the extraction and channel selection procedure. Finally, the proposed 
      R-peak detector is highly robust to background noise and residual maternal R-peak 
      components. SIGNIFICANCE: The proposed methods for fECG extraction, R-peak detection 
      and automatic channel selection are evaluated (visually and numerically), on two 
      online available datasets and compared with recently developed algorithms. The 
      proposed algorithm is statistically shown to outperform the benchmarks in terms of 
      average and standard deviation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Differential blood oxygenation between left (LV) and right ventricles 
      (RV; ΔSaO(2)) is a key index of cardiac performance; LV dysfunction yields increased 
      RV blood pool deoxygenation. Deoxyhemoglobin increases blood magnetic 
      susceptibility, which can be measured using an emerging cardiovascular magnetic 
      resonance (CMR) technique, Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping (QSM) - a concept 
      previously demonstrated in healthy subjects using a breath-hold 2D imaging approach 
      (2D(BH)QSM). This study tested utility of a novel 3D free-breathing QSM approach 
      (3D(NAV)QSM) in normative controls, and validated 3D(NAV)QSM for non-invasive 
      ΔSaO(2) quantification in patients undergoing invasive cardiac catheterization 
      (cath). METHODS: Initial control (n = 10) testing compared 2D(BH)QSM (ECG-triggered 
      2D gradient echo acquired at end-expiration) and 3D(NAV)QSM (ECG-triggered navigator 
      gated gradient echo acquired in free breathing using a phase-ordered automatic 
      window selection algorithm to partition data based on diaphragm position). Clinical 
      testing was subsequently performed in patients being considered for cath, including 
      3D(NAV)QSM comparison to cine-CMR quantified LV function (n = 39), and invasive-cath 
      quantified ΔSaO(2) (n = 15). QSM was acquired using 3 T scanners; analysis was 
      blinded to comparator tests (cine-CMR, cath). RESULTS: 3D(NAV)QSM generated 
      interpretable QSM in all controls; 2D(BH)QSM was successful in 6/10. Among controls 
      in whom both pulse sequences were successful, RV/LV susceptibility difference (and 
      ΔSaO(2)) were not significantly different between 3D(NAV)QSM and 2D(BH)QSM 
      (252 ± 39 ppb [17.5 ± 3.1%] vs. 211 ± 29 ppb [14.7 ± 2.0%]; p = 0.39). Acquisition 
      times were 30% lower with 3D(NAV)QSM (4.7 ± 0.9 vs. 6.7 ± 0.5 min, p = 0.002), 
      paralleling a trend towards lower LV mis-registration on 3D(NAV)QSM (p = 0.14). 
      Among cardiac patients (63 ± 10y, 56% CAD) 3D(NAV)QSM was successful in 87% (34/39) 
      and yielded higher ΔSaO(2) (24.9 ± 6.1%) than in controls (p < 0.001). 
      QSM-calculated ΔSaO(2) was higher among patients with LV dysfunction as measured on 
      cine-CMR based on left ventricular ejection fraction (29.4 ± 5.9% vs. 20.9 ± 5.7%, 
      p < 0.001) or stroke volume (27.9 ± 7.5% vs. 22.4 ± 5.5%, p = 0.013). Cath 
      measurements (n = 15) obtained within a mean interval of 4 ± 3 days from CMR 
      demonstrated 3D(NAV)QSM to yield high correlation (r = 0.87, p < 0.001), small bias 
      (- 0.1%), and good limits of agreement (±8.6%) with invasively measured ΔSaO(2). 
      CONCLUSION: 3D(NAV)QSM provides a novel means of assessing cardiac performance. 
      Differential susceptibility between the LV and RV is increased in patients with 
      cine-CMR evidence of LV systolic dysfunction; QSM-quantified ΔSaO(2) yields high 
      correlation and good agreement with the reference of invasively-quantified ΔSaO(2).

PG  - 257-67
LID - 10.1016/j.cmpb.2011.10.002 [doi]
AB  - This paper describes feature extraction methods using higher order statistics (HOS) 
      of wavelet packet decomposition (WPD) coefficients for the purpose of automatic 
      heartbeat recognition. The method consists of three stages. First, the wavelet 
      package coefficients (WPC) are calculated for each different type of ECG beat. Then, 
      higher order statistics of WPC are derived. Finally, the obtained feature set is 
      used as input to a classifier, which is based on k-NN algorithm. The MIT-BIH 
      arrhythmia database is used to obtain the ECG records used in this study. All 
      heartbeats in the arrhythmia database are grouped into five main heartbeat classes. 
      The classification accuracy of the proposed system is measured by average 
      sensitivity of 90%, average selectivity of 92% and average specificity of 98%. The 
      results show that HOS of WPC as features are highly discriminative for the 
      classification of different arrhythmic ECG beats.

TI  - Effect of high-frequency jet ventilation on heart rate variability.
PG  - 120-124
LID - 10.1007/BF02483347 [doi]
AB  - We investigated the effects of high-frequency jet ventilation (HFJV) on heart rate 
      variability in nine patients during fentanyl (10μg·kg(-1)) anesthesia using power 
      spectral density analysis. ECG and arterial pressure were recorded during 
      intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV) (tidal volume 8 ml·kg(-1), 
      respiratory rate 0.25 Hz) and during HFJV [5 Hz, 2.5 kg·(cm(2))(-1)]. The R-R 
      interval time series obtained were analyzed by the autoregressive method, and 
      low-frequency (LF) (0.05-0.15 Hz) power and high-frequency (HF) (0.20-0.50 Hz) power 
      from R-R interval spectra were used for statistical comparison. LF power did not 
      change during IPPV and HFJV (108.8±41.6 ms(2) vs 105.8±22.4 ms(2), mean±SE). HF 
      power was detected during IPPV (65.1±14.3 ms(2)); however, it was not detected 
      during HFJV. Plasma levels of norepinephrine and epinephrine were significantly 
      higher during HFJV than during IPPV. The mean R-R interval, arterial pressure, and 
      arterial blood gas data did not differ between IPPV and HFJV. These data indicate 
      that, during fentanyl anesthesia, HFJV influences mainly the respiratory frequency 
      fluctuation of heart rate variability, and they suggest that alteration of breathing 
      patterns caused by HFJV might be involved, as well as elevated sympathetic neural 
      outflow to the heart.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to survey current practices in European epilepsy 
      monitoring units (EMUs) with emphasis on safety issues. METHODS: A 37-item 
      questionnaire investigating characteristics and organization of EMUs, including 
      measures for prevention and management of seizure-related serious adverse events 
      (SAEs), was distributed to all identified European EMUs plus one located in Israel 
      (N=150). RESULTS: Forty-eight (32%) EMUs, located in 18 countries, completed the 
      questionnaire. Epilepsy monitoring unit beds are 1-2 in 43%, 3-4 in 34%, and 5-6 in 
      19% of EMUs; staff physicians are 1-2 in 32%, 3-4 in 34%, and 5-6 in 19% of EMUs. 
      Personnel operating in EMUs include epileptologists (in 69% of EMUs), clinical 
      neurophysiologists trained in epilepsy (in 46% of EMUs), child neurologists (in 35% 
      of EMUs), neurology and clinical neurophysiology residents (in 46% and in 8% of 
      EMUs, respectively), and neurologists not trained in epilepsy (in 27% of EMUs). In 
      20% of EMUs, patients' observation is only intermittent or during the daytime and 
      primarily carried out by neurophysiology technicians and/or nurses (in 71% of EMUs) 
      or by patients' relatives (in 40% of EMUs). Automatic detection systems for seizures 
      are used in 15%, for body movements in 8%, for oxygen desaturation in 33%, and for 
      ECG abnormalities in 17% of EMUs. Protocols for management of acute seizures are 
      lacking in 27%, of status epilepticus in 21%, and of postictal psychoses in 87% of 
      EMUs. Injury prevention consists of bed protections in 96% of EMUs, whereas 
      antisuffocation pillows are employed in 21%, and environmental protections in 
      monitoring rooms and in bathrooms are implemented in 38% and in 25% of EMUs, 
      respectively. The most common SAEs were status epilepticus reported by 79%, injuries 
      by 73%, and postictal psychoses by 67% of EMUs. CONCLUSIONS: All EMUs have faced 
      different types of SAEs. Wide variation in practice patterns and lack of protocols 
      and of precautions to ensure patients' safety might promote the occurrence and 
      severity of SAEs. Our findings highlight the need for standardized and shared 
      protocols for an effective and safe management of patients in EMUs.

TI  - Motion Artifact Reduction in Ultrasound Based Thermal Strain Imaging of 
      Atherosclerotic Plaques Using Time Series Analysis.
PG  - 1660-1668
AB  - Large lipid pools in vulnerable plaques, in principle, can be detected using US 
      based thermal strain imaging (US-TSI). One practical challenge for in vivo 
      cardiovascular application of US-TSI is that the thermal strain is masked by the 
      mechanical strain caused by cardiac pulsation. ECG gating is a widely adopted method 
      for cardiac motion compensation, but it is often susceptible to electrical and 
      physiological noise. In this paper, we present an alternative time series analysis 
      approach to separate thermal strain from the mechanical strain without using ECG. 
      The performance and feasibility of the time-series analysis technique was tested via 
      numerical simulation as well as in vitro water tank experiments using a vessel 
      mimicking phantom and an excised human atherosclerotic artery where the cardiac 
      pulsation is simulated by a pulsatile pump.

TI  - Can the heartscan be used for diagnosis and monitoring of emergencies in general 
      practice?
PG  - 525-31
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Mostly, it is impossible to establish the type of arrhythmias, based 
      on signs and symptoms only. An ECG device is not always within reach. We presumed 
      the heartscan, a handheld wireless device, to be of value to a GP in emergency 
      situations. We therefore studied inter- and intra-observer variability and the 
      accuracy of the screen readings. METHODS: All consecutive patients visiting the 
      emergency department (ED) of the Gasthuisberg University Hospital in Leuven, 
      Belgium, as well as patients hospitalised in three hospital wards on one day, were 
      included. Immediately after the heartscan recording, a standard 12-lead ECG was 
      recorded and read by an experienced hospital-based cardiologist. The recordings were 
      read on the device screen by two general practitioners. All readers were blinded to 
      the 12-lead ECG readings and vice versa, and for each other's ones. We compared both 
      the heartscan reading of the first reader and the automatic reading of the device 
      with the readings of the second GP and to the 12-lead ECG results, used as the gold 
      standard. Intra- and inter-observer agreement was studied using total accuracy and 
      kappa values with their 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: Full data of 177 
      (73%) patients, 80 men (45%) and 97 women (55%), with a mean age of 55 years (range 
      18-94 y) were recorded. The specificity of the heartscan reading by a clinician was 
      88%, the sensitivity between 60 and 69%, PPV < 50% and NPV > 95%. Comparing codes of 
      the heartscan with the ECG readings was difficult but sensitivity for atrial 
      fibrillation was 92.3%. Inter- and intra-observer accuracy were high (> 0.86 and > 
      or = 0.95, respectively), with low kappa values. CONCLUSION: The detection of rhythm 
      disorders by the device is incomplete. However, the heartscan can be a help for the 
      GP. The performance of the heartscan could probably be improved by increasing screen 
      resolution, but, in the future, more sophisticated heart monitors should become 
      available. They should be small, light and affordable.

TI  - Remote Monitoring of Patients Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement: A 
      Framework for Postprocedural Telemonitoring.
PG  - e9
LID - 10.2196/cardio.9075 [doi]
LID - e9
AB  - BACKGROUND: The postprocedural trajectory of patients undergoing transcatheter 
      aortic valve replacement (TAVR) involves in-hospital monitoring of potential cardiac 
      rhythm or conduction disorders and other complications. Recent advances in 
      telemonitoring technologies create opportunities to monitor electrocardiogram (ECG) 
      and vital signs remotely, facilitating redesign of follow-up trajectories. 
      OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to outline a potential set-up of telemonitoring after 
      TAVR. METHODS: A multidisciplinary team systematically framed the envisioned 
      telemonitoring scenario according to the intentions, People, Activities, Context, 
      Technology (iPACT) and Functionality, Interaction, Content, Services (FICS) methods 
      and identified corresponding technical requirements. RESULTS: In this scenario, a 
      wearable sensor system is used to continuously transmit ECG and contextual data to a 
      central monitoring unit, allowing remote follow-up of ECG abnormalities and physical 
      deteriorations. Telemonitoring is suggested as an alternative or supplement to 
      current in-hospital monitoring after TAVR, enabling early hospital dismissal in 
      eligible patients and accessible follow-up prolongation. Together, this approach 
      aims to improve rehabilitation, enhance patient comfort, optimize hospital capacity 
      usage, and reduce overall costs. Required technical components include continuous 
      data acquisition, real-time data transfer, privacy-ensured storage, automatic event 
      detection, and user-friendly interfaces. CONCLUSIONS: The suggested telemonitoring 
      set-up involves a new approach to patient follow-up that could bring durable 
      solutions for the growing scarcities in health care and for improving health care 
      quality. To further explore the potential and feasibility of post-TAVR

AB  - BACKGROUND: Multiple methods have been developed to assess what happens between and 
      within time series. In a particular type of these series, the previous values of the 
      currently observed series are contingent on the lagged values of another series. 
      These cases can commonly be addressed by regression. However, a model selection 
      criteria should be employed to evaluate the compromise between the amount of 
      information provided and the model complexity. This is the basis for the development 
      of the Matrix of Lags (MoL), a tool to study dependent time series. METHODS: For 
      each input, multiple regressions were applied to produce a model for each lag and a 
      model selection criterion identifies the lags that will populate an auxiliary 
      matrix. Afterwards, the energy of the lags (that are in the auxiliary matrix) was 
      used to define a row of the MoL. Therefore, each input corresponds to a row of the 
      MoL. To test the proposed tool, the heart rate variability and the electrocardiogram 
      derived respiration were employed to perform the indirect estimation of the 
      electroencephalography cyclic alternating pattern (CAP) cycles. Therefore, a support 
      vector machine was fed with the MoL to perform the CAP cycle classification for each 
      input signal. Multiple tests were carried out to further examine the proposed tool, 
      including the effect of balancing the datasets, application of other regression 
      methods and employment of two feature section models. The first was based on 
      sequential backward selection while the second examined characteristics of a return 
      map. RESULTS: The best performance of the subject independent model was attained by 
      feeding the lags, selected by sequential backward selection, to a support vector 
      machine, achieving an average accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and area under the 
      receiver operating characteristic curve of, respectively, 77%, 71%, 82% and 0.77. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The developed model allows to perform a measurement of a characteristic 
      marker of sleep instability (the CAP cycle) and the results are in the upper bound 
      of the specialist agreement range with visual analysis. Thus, the developed method 
      could possibly be used for clinical diagnosis.

TI  - I-Vector-Based Patient Adaptation of Deep Neural Networks for Automatic Heartbeat 
      Classification.
PG  - 717-727
LID - 10.1109/JBHI.2019.2919732 [doi]
AB  - Automatic classification of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals is important for 
      diagnosing heart arrhythmias. A big challenge in automatic ECG classification is the 
      variation in the waveforms and characteristics of ECG signals among different 
      patients. To address this issue, this paper proposes adapting a patient-independent 
      deep neural network (DNN) using the information in the patient-dependent identity 
      vectors (i-vectors). The adapted networks, namely i-vector adapted patient-specific 
      DNNs (iAP-DNNs), are tuned toward the ECG characteristics of individual patients. 
      For each patient, his/her ECG waveforms are compressed into an i-vector using a 
      factor analysis model. Then, this i-vector is injected into the middle hidden layer 
      of the patient-independent DNN. Stochastic gradient descent is then applied to 
      fine-tune the whole network to form a patient-specific classifier. As a result, the 
      adaptation makes use of not only the raw ECG waveforms from the specific patient but 
      also the compact representation of his/her ECG characteristics through the i-vector. 
      Analysis on the hidden-layer activations shows that by leveraging the information in 
      the i-vectors, the iAP-DNNs are more capable of discriminating normal heartbeats 
      against arrhythmic heartbeats than the networks that use the patient-specific ECG 
      only for the adaptation. Experimental results based on the MIT-BIH database suggest 
      that the iAP-DNNs perform better than existing patient-specific classifiers in terms 
      of various performance measures. In particular, the sensitivity and specificity of 
      the existing methods are all under the receiver operating characteristic curves of 
      the iAP-DNNs.

TI  - Open source model for generating RR intervals in atrial fibrillation and beyond.
PG  - 9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Realistic modeling of cardiac inter-beat (RR) intervals is highly 
      desirable for basic research in cardiac electrophysiology, clinical management of 
      heart diseases, and developing signal processing tools for ECG analysis. METHODS: We 
      present an open source computer model that is capable to generate realistic time 
      series of RR intervals in both physiologic and pathologic conditions. Detailed model 
      structure and the software implementation are described. RESULTS: Examples are 
      provided on how to use this model to generate RR intervals in atrial fibrillation 
      with ventricular pacing, normal sinus rhythm with heart rate variability, and 
      typical atrial flutter with atrioventricular block. The extensibility of the model 
      is also discussed. CONCLUSION: The present computer model provides a unified 
      platform wherein various types of ventricular rhythm can be simulated. The 
      availability of this open source model promises to support and stimulate future 
      studies.

TI  - Computing network-based features from physiological time series: application to 
      sepsis detection.
PG  - 3825-6
LID - 10.1109/EMBC.2014.6944457 [doi]
AB  - Sepsis is a systemic deleterious host response to infection. It is a major 
      healthcare problem that affects millions of patients every year in the intensive 
      care units (ICUs) worldwide. Despite the fact that ICU patients are heavily 
      instrumented with physiological sensors, early sepsis detection remains challenging, 
      perhaps because clinicians identify sepsis by using static scores derived from 
      bed-side measurements individually, i.e., without systematically accounting for 
      potential interactions between these signals and their dynamics. In this study, we 
      apply network-based data analysis to take into account interactions between bed-side 
      physiological time series (PTS) data collected in ICU patients, and we investigate 
      features to distinguish between sepsis and non-sepsis conditions. We treated each 
      PTS source as a node on a graph and we retrieved the graph connectivity matrix over 
      time by tracking the correlation between each pair of sources' signals over 
      consecutive time windows. Then, for each connectivity matrix, we computed the 
      eigenvalue decomposition. We found that, even though raw PTS measurements may have 
      indistinguishable distributions in non-sepsis and early sepsis states, the median /I 
      of the eigenvalues computed from the same data is statistically different (p <; 
      0.001) in the two states and the evolution of /I may reflect the disease 
      progression. Although preliminary, these findings suggest that network-based 
      features computed from continuous PTS data may be useful for early sepsis detection.

AB  - Until recently, cardiovascular computed tomography angiography (CCTA) was associated 
      with considerable radiation doses. The introduction of tube current modulation and 
      automatic tube potential selection as well as high-pitch prospective ECG-triggering 
      and iterative reconstruction offer the ability to decrease dose with approximately 
      one order of magnitude, often to sub-millisievert dose levels. In parallel, 
      advancements in computational technology have enabled the measurement of fractional 
      flow reserve (FFR) from CCTA data (FFRCT). This technique shows potential to replace 
      invasively measured FFR to select patients in need of coronary intervention. 
      Furthermore, developments in scanner hardware have led to the introduction of 
      dual-energy and photon-counting CT, which offer the possibility of material 
      decomposition imaging. Dual-energy CT reduces beam hardening, which enables CCTA in 
      patients with a high calcium burden and more robust myocardial CT perfusion imaging. 
      Future-generation CT systems will be capable of counting individual X-ray photons. 
      Photon-counting CT is promising and may result in a substantial further radiation 
      dose reduction, vastly increased spatial resolution, and the introduction of a whole 
      new class of contrast agents.

TI  - [Correlation between respiration and heart rate in 12- to 14-year-old children 
      during sleep and wakefulness].
PG  - 467-9
AB  - The coupling of respiratory and cardiac rhythm is determined by interactions of 
      oscillating brain stem centers and external physical and psychical influences. Not 
      well known are effects of sleep and wakefulness which will be investigated over the 
      day. From the ECG and respirogram of 42 healthy children (11 female, 31 male, 12 to 
      14 years) during 24 h the time series of instantaneous heart rate (HR) and 
      respiratory rhythm and from this by FFT the density spectra of power, the maximal 
      power and related frequency in the respiratory range were ascertained. Differences 
      between nonREM sleep and wakefulness and the strength of coupling were determined by 
      coherence analysis. In all probands the maximal power of HR and of the coherence 
      were higher during nonREM sleep than in wakefulness. Both values were stable during 
      each state. The maximum related frequencies of HR and respiration shifted parallel 
      between sleep and wakefulness. The results mean augmentation in nonREM sleep 
      following to improved transfer of respiratory activity to the control of HR. The 
      increased coherence hints at a stronger linear coupling which is stable during each 
      state. The changes of cardiorespiratory coupling may be effected by stronger 
      non-linear parts in the interactions during wakefulness.

AB  - BACKGROUND: T-wave alternans (TWA) is defined as a consistent variation in the 
      repolarization morphology that repeats on every other beat. This study aimed to 
      evaluate beat-to-beat TWA detection using the Ensemble EMD (EEMD) method. METHOD: A 
      total of 108 recordings of standard 12-lead ECGs of 69 healthy subjects (17 females, 
      42±18 years; 52 males, 40±13 years) and 39 cardiac-condition patients (ischemic 
      cardiomyopathy; ICM and dilated cardiomyopathy; DCM) with left ventricular ejection 
      fractions (LVEF) ≤40% were studied. We first determined the QT interval of ECG via a 
      template matching algorithm. Then, beat-to-beat T-waves were extracted to quantify 
      beat-to-beat TWA. The EEMD method was applied to the T-wave time series to decompose 
      them into a set of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). The instantaneous frequency was 
      measured by performing the Hilbert transform on the selected IMF for extracting the 
      features. Four different classifiers were applied to the extracted features to 
      assess and classify the existence of TWA in the ECG signal. RESULTS: In the 
      simulation study, the global classifier worked better than the subject-based 
      classifier for detecting alternans in the T-waves. In addition, the average accuracy 
      and sensitivity for detecting TWA were greater than 80%. In the real Holter ECG data 
      obtained from Toronto General Hospital, the Ensemble classifier had higher 
      classification accuracy, 74%, than other classifiers and a positive predictive value 
      of 100%. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the proposed Ensemble EMD method with Ensemble 
      classifier can be utilized for detecting beat-to-beat TWA in the ECG signal.

PG  - 69-75
AB  - In order to compare the heart rate variability (HRV) and stroke volume variability 
      (SVV), supine electrocardiographic (ECG) and the time series data of left 
      ventricular (LV) volume recordings were taken in 12 healthy adult male volunteers. 
      The low frequency (LF) and high frequency (HF) peaks of HRV and SVV were evaluated 
      quantitatively by power spectral analysis. The fractal dimension (FD) of the time 
      series data was analyzed by the box-counting method. A LF peak around 0.1 Hz and a 
      HF peak around 0.3 Hz were as clearly observed in the SVV spectrum as in the HRV 
      spectrum. The LF/HF ratio in SVV was significantly lower than that in HRV, while the 
      FD was significantly higher in SVV than in HRV. No significant correlation of HF, LF 
      or FD was observed between HRV and SVV. Our results indicate that SVV provides 
      different information about the activity of the autonomic nervous system than HRV.

TI  - Atrial Fibrillation Detection in ICU Patients: A Pilot Study on MIMIC III Data().
PG  - 298-301
LID - 10.1109/EMBC.2019.8856496 [doi]
AB  - Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most prevalent arrhythmia, resulting in varying and 
      irregular heartbeats. AF increases risk for numerous cardiovascular diseases 
      including stroke, heart failure and as a result, computer aided efficient monitoring 
      of AF is crucial, especially for intensive care unit (ICU) patients. In this paper, 
      we present an automated and robust algorithm to detect AF from ICU patients using 
      electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. Several statistical parameters including root mean 
      square of successive differences, Shannon entropy, Sample entropy and turning point 
      ratio are calculated from the heart rate. A subset of the Medical Information Mart 
      for Intensive Care (MIMIC) III database containing 36 subjects is used in this 
      study. We compare the AF detection performance of several classifiers for both the 
      training and blinded test data. Using the support vector machine classifier with 
      radial basis kernel, the proposed method achieves 99.95% cross-validation accuracy 
      on the training data and 99.88% sensitivity, 99.65% specificity and 99.75% accuracy 
      on the blinded test data.

TI  - A review of methods for the signal quality assessment to improve reliability of 
      heart rate and blood pressures derived parameters.
PG  - 1025-35
LID - 10.1007/s11517-016-1453-5 [doi]
AB  - The assessment of signal quality has been a research topic since the late 1970s, as 
      it is mainly related to the problem of false alarms in bedside monitors in the 
      intensive care unit (ICU), the incidence of which can be as high as 90 %, leading to 
      alarm fatigue and a drop in the overall level of nurses and clinicians attention. 
      The development of efficient algorithms for the quality control of long diagnostic 
      electrocardiographic (ECG) recordings, both single- and multi-lead, and of the 
      arterial blood pressure (ABP) signal is therefore essential for the enhancement of 
      care quality. The ECG signal is often corrupted by noise, which can be within the 
      frequency band of interest and can manifest similar morphologies as the ECG itself. 
      Similarly to ECG, also the ABP signal is often corrupted by non-Gaussian, nonlinear 
      and non-stationary noise and artifacts, especially in ICU recordings. Moreover, the 
      reliability of several important parameters derived from ABP such as systolic blood 
      pressure or pulse pressure is strongly affected by the quality of the ABP waveform. 
      In this work, several up-to-date algorithms for the quality scoring of a single- or 
      multi-lead ECG recording, based on time-domain approaches, frequency-domain 
      approaches or a combination of the two will be reviewed, as well as methods for the 
      quality assessment of ABP. Additionally, algorithms exploiting the relationship 
      between ECG and pulsatile signals, such as ABP and photoplethysmographic recordings, 
      for the reduction in the false alarm rate will be presented. Finally, some 
      considerations will be drawn taking into account the large heterogeneity of clinical 
      settings, applications and goals that the reviewed algorithms have to deal with.

AB  - Due to its simplicity and low cost, analyzing an electrocardiogram (ECG) is the most 
      common technique for detecting cardiac arrhythmia. The massive amount of ECG data 
      collected every day, in home and hospital, may preclude data review by human 
      operators/technicians. Therefore, several methods are proposed for either fully 
      automatic arrhythmia detection or event selection for further verification by human 
      experts. Traditional machine learning approaches have made significant progress in 
      the past years. However, those methods rely on hand-crafted feature extraction, 
      which requires in-depth domain knowledge and preprocessing of the signal (e.g., beat 
      detection). This, plus the high variability in wave morphology among patients and 
      the presence of noise, make it challenging for computerized interpretation to 
      achieve high accuracy. Recent advances in deep learning make it possible to perform 
      automatic high-level feature extraction and classification. Therefore, deep learning 
      approaches have gained interest in arrhythmia detection. In this work, we reviewed 
      the recent advancement of deep learning methods for automatic arrhythmia detection. 
      We summarized existing literature from five aspects: utilized dataset, application, 
      type of input data, model architecture, and performance evaluation. We also reported 
      limitations of reviewed papers and potential future opportunities.

AB  - Automatic heartbeat classification is an important technique to assist doctors to 
      identify ectopic heartbeats in long-term Holter recording. In this paper, we 
      introduce a novel disease-specific feature selection method which consists of a 
      one-versus-one (OvO) features ranking stage and a feature search stage wrapped in 
      the same OvO-rule support vector machine (SVM) binary classifier. The proposed 
      method differs from traditional approaches in that it focuses on the selection of 
      effective feature subsets for distinguishing a class from others by making OvO 
      comparison. The electrocardiograms (ECG) from the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database 
      (MIT-BIH-AR) are used to evaluate the proposed feature selection method. The ECG 
      features adopted include inter-beat and intra-beat intervals, amplitude morphology, 
      area morphology and morphological distance. Following the recommendation of the 
      Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI), all the heartbeat samples of 
      MIT-BIH-AR are grouped into four classes, namely, normal or bundle branch block (N), 
      supraventricular ectopic (S), ventricular ectopic (V) and fusion of ventricular and 
      normal (F). The division of training and testing data complies with the 
      inter-patient schema. Experimental results show that the average classification 
      accuracy of the proposed feature selection method is 86.66%, outperforming those 
      methods without feature selection. The sensitivities for the classes N, S, V and F 
      are 88.94%, 79.06%, 85.48% and 93.81% respectively, and the corresponding positive 
      predictive values are 98.98%, 35.98%, 92.75% and 13.74% respectively. In terms of 
      geometric means of sensitivity and positive predictivity, the proposed method also 
      demonstrates better performance than other state-of-the-art feature selection 
      methods.

AB  - PURPOSE: To assess the clinical significance of serial troponin I levels (measured 
      in the first 72 hours from admission) in 42 consecutive patients with 
      moderate-to-severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Echocardiography and 
      electrocardiogram testings were serially performed in the time window. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: Troponin I was measured every 12 hours in the first 72 hours from intensive 
      care unit (ICU) admission. Echocardiography and electrocardiogram testings were 
      serially performed in the same time window to clinically interpret Tn I levels. 
      RESULTS: Patients with admission positive Tn I (38.1%) showed higher values of 
      systolic pulmonary hypertension (P = .013) associated with significantly lower 
      values of tricuspid annular plane excursion (P = .011). Twenty-five patients (25/42, 
      59.5%) exhibited positive peak Tn I and at second echocardiographic assessment 
      exhibited significant lower tricuspid annular plane excursion values (P = .005). At 
      stepwise regression analysis the following variables were an independent predictor 
      for in-ICU mortality: Pco2 (OR 1.08, 95% CI 1.011-1.161, P = .023), systolic 
      pulmonary arterial hypertension (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.701-0.977, P = .002), log peak Tn 
      I (OR 3.56, 95% CI 1.045-12.132, P = .042). CONCLUSIONS: In moderate-to-severe ARDS, 
      serial troponin I assessment together with echocardiography evaluation helped to 
      identify a subgroup at higher risk for in-ICU death. Moreover, troponin release can 
      be related to right ventricular dysfunction, thus highlighting the clinical role of 
      echocardiography in ARDS patients.

TI  - A case of congenital central hypoventilation syndrome.
PG  - 922-4
LID - 10.1007/s00540-012-1451-1 [doi]
AB  - We encountered a 2-year-old female infant with congenital central hypoventilation 
      syndrome (CCHS) who underwent an abdominal operation for strangulated ileus. Prior 
      to the surgery, at home, the infant had been receiving non-invasive 
      positive-pressure ventilation (NPPV) support only during sleep. However, after 
      postoperative extubation, the blood oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) decreased to 
      approximately 90 % with NPPV during sleep alone, necessitating the use of biphasic 
      cuirass ventilation (BCV) along with NPPV for 2 days. The infant was weaned from the 
      BCV on hospital day 9, and was discharged from the intensive care unit (ICU) on 
      hospital day 13. Although it has been said that CCHS is not under the control of the 
      respiratory center, there are no reports of the true CO(2) response curves in these 
      patients. Therefore, during respiratory management in the ICU post-surgery, we 
      examined (with the consent of the mother) the relationship of the end-tidal carbon 
      dioxide (ETCO(2)) to the tidal volume and respiratory rate, for a period of 6 min in 
      the absence of sedation, using a respiratory profile monitor. Electrocardiographic 
      and SpO(2) monitoring was also conducted at the same time, to ensure the patient's 
      safety. In this patient, while the ETCO(2) increased, the tidal volume and 
      respiratory rate remained unchanged. No relationship was found between the tidal 
      volume and the respiratory rate. Various modalities have been used for the treatment 
      of CCHS (tracheotomy, NPPV, and diaphragmatic pacing). Treatment of these patients 
      in the ICU should be tailored to the needs of individual patients and their 
      families.

AB  - Early detection of coronary heart disease (CHD) has the potential to prevent the 
      millions of deaths that this disease causes worldwide every year. However, there 
      exist few automatic methods to detect CHD at an early stage. A challenge in the 
      development of these methods is the absence of relevant datasets for their training 
      and validation. Here, the ten Tusscher-Panfilov 2006 model and the O'Hara-Rudy model 
      for human myocytes were used to create two populations of models that were in 
      concordance with data obtained from healthy individuals (control populations) and 
      included inter-subject variability. The effects of ischemia were subsequently 
      included in the control populations to simulate the effects of mild and severe 
      ischemic events on single cells, full ischemic cables of cells and cables of cells 
      with various sizes of ischemic regions. Action potential and pseudo-ECG biomarkers 
      were measured to assess how the evolution of ischemia could be quantified. Finally, 
      two neural network classifiers were trained to identify the different degrees of 
      ischemia using the pseudo-ECG biomarkers. The control populations showed action 
      potential and pseudo-ECG biomarkers within the physiological ranges and the trends 
      in the biomarkers commonly identified in ischemic patients were observed in the 
      ischemic populations. On the one hand, inter-subject variability in the ischemic 
      pseudo-ECGs precluded the detection and classification of early ischemic events 
      using any single biomarker. On the other hand, the neural networks showed 
      sensitivity and positive predictive value above 95%. Additionally, the neural 
      networks revealed that the biomarkers that were relevant for the detection of 
      ischemia were different from those relevant for its classification. This work showed 
      that a computational approach could be used, when data is scarce, to validate 
      proof-of-concept machine learning methods to detect ischemic events.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of the time interval from indication of hypoxia to 
      delivery on neonatal outcome in high-risk pregnancies monitored with 
      cardiotocography (CTG) and ST-waveform analysis. DESIGN: Prospective observational 
      study. SETTING: University hospital, Norway, 2004-08. POPULATION: Singleton 
      high-risk births with a gestational age above 35(+6) weeks, monitored with CTG and 
      ST-waveform analysis. METHODS: Logistic regression analysis and Kaplan-Meier 
      survival plots. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Neonatal morbidity in relation to the rapidity 
      of intervention. RESULTS: Of 6010 deliveries monitored with ST-waveform analysis, 
      1131 (19%) had an indication to intervene for fetal distress according to clinical 
      guidelines. Those fetuses were at increased risk of an adverse neonatal outcome, and 
      if delivered later than 20 min after the indication of hypoxia their risk increased 
      further; i.e. transfer to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) from an odds ratio 
      of 1.6 (95% confidence interval 1.2-2.2) to an odds ratio of 3.3 (95% confidence 
      interval 2.5-4.3). The indication-to-delivery interval was longer for neonates with 
      a 5-min Apgar score of <7, transfer to NICU and neonatal encephalopathy than for 
      those without adverse outcome. CONCLUSION: In deliveries monitored with CTG and 
      ST-waveform analysis, the risk of an adverse neonatal outcome was dependent on the 
      time between indication of hypoxia and delivery. Nonadherence to the specific 
      clinical guidelines increased the risk of neonatal morbidity.

PG  - 179-94
LID - 10.1016/j.cmpb.2010.04.013 [doi]
AB  - Automatic classification of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals is vital for clinical 
      diagnosis of heart disease. This paper investigates the design of an efficient 
      system for recognition of the premature ventricular contraction from the normal 
      beats and other heart diseases. This system includes three main modules: denoising 
      module, feature extraction module and classifier module. In the denoising module, it 
      is proposed the stationary wavelet transform for noise reduction of the 
      electrocardiogram signals. In the feature extraction module a proper combination of 
      the morphological-based features and timing interval-based features are proposed. As 
      the classifier, several supervised classifiers are investigated; they are: a number 
      of multi-layer perceptron neural networks with different number of layers and 
      training algorithms, support vector machines with different kernel types, radial 
      basis function and probabilistic neural networks. Also, for comparison the proposed 
      features, we have considered the wavelet-based features. It has done comprehensive 
      simulations in order to achieve a high efficient system for ECG beat classification 
      from 12 files obtained from the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database. Simulation results show 
      that best results are achieved about 97.14% for classification of ECG beats.

      June 2018. According to LVEF, they were divided into two groups: LVEF ≥50% group 
      (n=26) and LVEF <50% group (n=18). After treatment, 25 children were followed up for 
      3-42 months (mean 14±9 months). The Guangdong Zhongshan SR-1000A ECG Automatic 
      Analyzer was used to obtain the 12-lead body surface ECG results in the supine 
      position. T-wave amplitude on ECG was evaluated by software and manual measurement. 
      RESULTS: Compared with the LVEF ≥50% group, the LVEF <50% group had a significant 
      reduction in the T-wave amplitude in leads II, V4, V5 and V6 (P<0.05). The 
      increased-LVEF group (an increase in LVEF > 5% after treatment) had a significant 
      increase in the T-wave amplitude in leads aVR, V5, and V6 after treatment (P<0.05), 
      while the unchanged-LVEF group (an increase in LVEF ≤ 5% after treatment) had a 
      significant reduction in the T-wave amplitude in lead aVR after treatment (P<0.05). 
      The receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that the T-wave 
      amplitude in leads II, V4, V5 and V6 had a certain value in predicting LVEF <50% in 
      children with dilated cardiomyopathy (P<0.05). A combination of T-wave amplitude of 
      ≤0.20 mV in lead II, ≤0.40 mV in lead V4, and ≤0.30 mV in leads V5 and V6 had a 
      sensitivity of 88.2% and specificity of 76.0% in the predication of LVEF <50% in 
      children with dilated cardiomyopathy. CONCLUSIONS: T-wave amplitude on ECG can be 
      used as the indexes for the evaluation of the left ventricular systolic function in 
      children with dilated cardiomyopathy.

TI  - Atrial fibrillation detection using a novel three-vector cardiac implantable 
      monitor: the atrial fibrillation detect study.

AB  - AIMS: Continuous rhythm monitoring is valuable for adequate atrial fibrillation (AF) 
      management in the clinical setting. Subcutaneous leadless implantable cardiac 
      monitors (ICMs) yield an improved AF detection, overcoming the intrinsic limitations 
      of the currently available external recording systems, thus resulting in a more 
      accurate patient treatment. The study purpose was to assess the detection 
      performance of a novel three-vector ICM device equipped with a dedicated AF 
      algorithm. METHODS AND RESULTS: Sixty-six patients (86.4% males; mean age 60.4 ± 9.4 
      years) at risk to present AF episodes, having undergone the novel ICM implant 
      (BioMonitor, Biotronik SE&Co. KG, Berlin, Germany), were enrolled. External 48-h ECG 
      Holter was performed 4 weeks after the device implantation. The automatic ICM AF 
      classification was compared with the manual Holter arrhythmia recordings. Of the 
      overall study population, 63/66 (95.5%) had analysable Holter data, 39/63 (62%) 
      showed at least one true AF episode. All these patients had at least one AF episode 
      stored in the ICM. On Holter monitoring, 24/63 (38%) patients did not show AF 
      episodes, in 16 of them (16/24, 67%), the ICM confirmed the absence of AF. The AF 
      detection sensitivity and positive predictive value for episodes' analysis were 95.4 
      and 76.3%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Continuous monitoring using this novel device, 
      equipped with a dedicated detection algorithm, yields an accurate and reliable 
      detection of AF episodes. The ICM is a promising tool for tailoring individual AF 
      patient management. Further long-term prospective studies are necessary to confirm 
      these encouraging results.

TI  - A probabilistic neural network as the predictive classifier of out-of-hospital 
      defibrillation outcomes.
PG  - 31-6
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Although modern defibrillators are nearly always successful in 
      terminating ventricular fibrillation (VF), multiple defibrillation attempts are 
      usually required to achieve return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). This is 
      potentially deleterious as cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) must be discontinued 
      during each defibrillation attempt which causes deterioration in the heart muscle 
      and reduces the chance of ROSC from later defibrillation attempts. In this work 
      defibrillation outcomes are predicted prior to electrical shocks using a neural 
      network model to analyse VF time series in an attempt to avoid defibrillation 
      attempts that do not result in ROSC. METHODS: The 198 pre-shock VF ECG episodes from 
      83 cardiac arrest patients with defibrillation conversions to different outcomes 
      were selected from the Oslo ambulance service database. A probabilistic neural 
      network model was designed for training and testing with a cross validation method 
      being used for the better generalisation performance. RESULTS: We achieved an 
      accuracy of 75% in overall prediction with a sensitivity of 84% and a specificity of 
      65% using VF ECG time series of an order of 1 s in length. CONCLUSION: Pre-shock VF 
      ECG time series can be classified according to the defibrillation conversion to a 
      return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) or No-ROSC.

TI  - Ventricular fibrillation and tachycardia classification using a machine learning 
      approach.
PG  - 1607-13
LID - 10.1109/TBME.2013.2275000 [doi]
AB  - Correct detection and classification of ventricular fibrillation (VF) and rapid 
      ventricular tachycardia (VT) is of pivotal importance for an automatic external 
      defibrillator and patient monitoring. In this paper, a VF/VT classification 
      algorithm using a machine learning method, a support vector machine, is proposed. A 
      total of 14 metrics were extracted from a specific window length of the 
      electrocardiogram (ECG). A genetic algorithm was then used to select the optimal 
      variable combinations. Three annotated public domain ECG databases (the American 
      Heart Association Database, the Creighton University Ventricular Tachyarrhythmia 
      Database, and the MIT-BIH Malignant Ventricular Arrhythmia Database) were used as 
      training, test, and validation datasets. Different window sizes, varying from 1 to 
      10 s were tested. An accuracy (Ac) of 98.1%, sensitivity (Se) of 98.4%, and 
      specificity (Sp) of 98.0% were obtained on the in-sample training data with 5 
      s-window size and two selected metrics. On the out-of-sample validation data, an Ac 
      of 96.3% ± 3.4%, Se of 96.2% ± 2.7%, and Sp of 96.2% ± 4.6% were obtained by 
      fivefold cross validation. The results surpass those of current reported methods.

TI  - Adaptive sleep-wake discrimination for wearable devices.
PG  - 920-6
LID - 10.1109/TBME.2010.2097261 [doi]
AB  - Sleep/wake classification systems that rely on physiological signals suffer from 
      intersubject differences that make accurate classification with a single, 
      subject-independent model difficult. To overcome the limitations of intersubject 
      variability, we suggest a novel online adaptation technique that updates the 
      sleep/wake classifier in real time. The objective of the present study was to 
      evaluate the performance of a newly developed adaptive classification algorithm that 
      was embedded on a wearable sleep/wake classification system called SleePic. The 
      algorithm processed ECG and respiratory effort signals for the classification task 
      and applied behavioral measurements (obtained from accelerometer and press-button 
      data) for the automatic adaptation task. When trained as a subject-independent 
      classifier algorithm, the SleePic device was only able to correctly classify 74.94 ± 
      6.76% of the human-rated sleep/wake data. By using the suggested automatic 
      adaptation method, the mean classification accuracy could be significantly improved 
      to 92.98 ± 3.19%. A subject-independent classifier based on activity data only 
      showed a comparable accuracy of 90.44 ± 3.57%. We demonstrated that 
      subject-independent models used for online sleep-wake classification can 
      successfully be adapted to previously unseen subjects without the intervention of 
      human experts or off-line calibration.

      (PiCCO) monitoring in the treatment management of patients with severe heart 
      failure. METHODS: Sixty patients of severe heart failure admitted to intensive care 
      unit (ICU) of Fujian Provincial Hospital from August 2017 to February 2019 were 
      enrolled, and they were divided into control group and treatment group according to 
      random number table method, with 30 in each group. The treatment group used bedside 
      PiCCO to carry out minimally invasive hemodynamics monitoring, according to the 
      monitoring data target guidance for vasoactive drugs and liquid management. The 
      control group was based only on traditional electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring and 
      lung sound, urine volume of vasoactive drugs and liquid management. The changes of 
      cardiac index (CI), global end diastolic volume index (GEDVI), extravascular lung 
      water index (EVLWI), systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI), invasive mean 
      arterial pressure (MAP) and central venous pressure (CVP) were observed before and 
      72 hours after treatment in the treatment group. The 7-day total effective rate, the 
      length of ICU stay and 28-day mortality were compared between the two groups. 
      RESULTS: Compared with before treatment, CI and MAP in the treatment group were 
      significantly increased after treatment [CI (mL×s(-1)×m(-2)): 53.34±16.67 vs. 
      35.01±13.34, MAP (mmHg, 1 mmHg = 0.133 kPa): 72.6±10.6 vs. 62.5±10.3, both P < 
      0.05], GEDVI, EVLWI, SVRI, CVP were significantly decreased [GEDVI (mL/m(2)): 
      760.3±90.2 vs. 960.2±110.3, EVLWI (mL/kg): 6.5±1.3 vs. 12.5±6.2, SVRI 
      (kPa×s×L(-1)×m(-2)): 297.3±35.1 vs. 434.1±58.8, CVP (mmHg): 10.1±2.6 vs. 12.2±3.4, 
      all P < 0.05]. Compared with the control group, the 7-day total effective rate of 
      the treatment group was significantly higher (90.0% vs. 80.0%), the length of ICU 
      stay was significantly shorter (days: 8.2±4.5 vs. 10.3±2.5), and the 28-day 
      mortality was significantly lower, with statistically significant difference (all P 
      < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: PiCCO monitoring is a goal-oriented treatment management for 
      patients with severe heart failure, which is helpful to individualized accurate 
      treatment, shorten the length of ICU stay and improve short-term prognosis.

TI  - The power spectral analysis of heart rate variability in athletes during dynamic 
      exercise--Part I.
PG  - 583-6
AB  - In this study, the effects of long-term physical training on autonomic function in 
      athletes and the response of the autonomic nervous system to dynamic exercise were 
      investigated in nonathletes and athletes with power spectral analysis of heart rate 
      variability (HRV). This study was performed on 13 healthy subjects (5 athletes and 8 
      non athletes). Electrocardiographic (ECG) signals were continuously recorded during 
      (1) 15 min of rest in a sitting position on a bicycle ergometer, (2) the dynamic 
      exercise test to the point of exhaustion, and (3) a 15 min postexercise period. 
      After the recorded ECG signals were sampled at 500 samples/s, the instantaneous HRV 
      signal was constructed from the detected R peaks and then resampled at 4 Hz in order 
      to obtain an evenly spaced time series applicable to power spectral analysis. After 
      linear trends were removed by the robust locally weighted regression algorithm, the 
      power spectrum of HRV was estimated for contiguous records of 512 samples by Burg's 
      maximum entrophy method. HRV was quantified by determining the spectral area (power) 
      in two frequency bands, low-frequency power (LF power: 0.05-0.15 Hz) and 
      high-frequency power (HF power: 0.15-0.8 Hz), and their ratio. The comparison 
      between athletes and nonathlete was performed in terms of the above-mentioned 
      parameters. Although both groups showed similar trends in heart rate (HR) at all 
      stages of protocols, HR in athletes was significantly lower than that in nonathletes 
      during rest and postexercise. In athletes and nonathletes, LF and HF powers 
      gradually decreased with exercise. As recovery progressed, they continued to 
      increase gradually, but remained below resting level. During rest and postexercise, 
      HF power in athletes was significantly (p < 0.05) higher than than in nonathletes. 
      Also, the recovery of HR and HF powers during early recovery (PO1) was more rapid in 
      athletes than in nonathletes. Both groups showed an attenuation of LF and HF powers 
      during dynamic exercise. It is likely that, in athletes, the lower HR during rest 
      and the more rapid recovery of HR postexercise was due to a high level of HF power, 
      indicating that vagal activity was enhanced by the adaptive changes in neural 
      regulation produced by long-term physical training.

TI  - Automated artifact removal as preprocessing refines neonatal seizure detection.
PG  - 2345-54
LID - 10.1016/j.clinph.2011.04.026 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The description and evaluation of algorithms using Independent Component 
      Analysis (ICA) for automatic removal of ECG, pulsation and respiration artifacts in 
      neonatal EEG before automated seizure detection. METHODS: The developed algorithms 
      decompose the EEG using ICA into its underlying sources. The artifact source was 
      identified using the simultaneously recorded polygraphy signals after preprocessing. 
      The EEG was reconstructed without the corrupting source, leading to a clean EEG. The 
      impact of the artifact removal was measured by comparing the performance of a 
      previously developed seizure detector before and after the artifact removal in 13 
      selected patients (9 having artifact-contaminated and 4 having artifact-free EEGs). 
      RESULTS: A significant decrease in false alarms (p=0.01) was found while the Good 
      Detection Rate (GDR) for seizures was not altered (p=0.50). CONCLUSIONS: The 
      techniques reduced the number of false positive detections without lowering 
      sensitivity and are beneficial in long term EEG seizure monitoring in the presence 
      of disturbing biological artifacts. SIGNIFICANCE: The proposed algorithms improve 
      neonatal seizure monitoring.

LID - 10.1016/j.resuscitation.2016.01.015 [doi]
AB  - AIM: Resuscitation guidelines recommend different treatments depending on the 
      patient's cardiac rhythm. Rhythm interpretation is a key tool to retrospectively 
      evaluate and improve the quality of treatment. Manual rhythm annotation is time 
      consuming and an obstacle for handling large resuscitation datasets efficiently. The 
      objective of this study was to develop a system for automatic rhythm interpretation 
      by using signal processing and machine learning algorithms. METHODS: Data from 302 
      out of hospital cardiac arrest patients were used. In total 1669 3-second artifact 
      free ECG segments with clinical rhythm annotations were extracted. The proposed 
      algorithms combine 32 features obtained from both wavelet- and time-domain 
      representations of the ECG, followed by a feature selection procedure based on the 
      wrapper method in a nested cross-validation architecture. Linear and quadratic 
      discriminant analyses (LDA and QDA) were used to automatically classify the segments 
      into one of five rhythm types: ventricular tachycardia (VT), ventricular 
      fibrillation (VF), pulseless electrical activity (PEA), asystole (AS), and pulse 
      generating rhythms (PR). RESULTS: The overall accuracy for the best algorithm was 
      68%. VT, VF, and AS are recognized with sensitivities of 71%, 75%, and 79%, 
      respectively. Sensitivities for PEA and PR were 55% and 56%, respectively, which 
      reflects the difficulty of identifying pulse using only the ECG. CONCLUSIONS: An ECG 
      based automatic rhythm interpreter for resuscitation has been demonstrated. The 
      interpreter handles VT, VF and AS well, while PEA and PR discrimination poses a more 
      difficult problem.

TI  - Paradoxical physiological responses to propranolol in a Rett syndrome patient: a 
      case report.
PG  - 194
LID - 194
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rett Syndrome (RTT), caused by a loss-of-function in the epigenetic 
      modulator: X-linked methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2), is a pervasive 
      neurological disorder characterized by compromised brain functions, anxiety, severe 
      mental retardation, language and learning disabilities, repetitive stereotyped hand 
      movements and developmental regression. An imbalance in the sympathetic and the 
      parasympathetic nervous system (dysautonomia) and the resulting autonomic storms is 
      a frequent occurrence in patients with RTT. The prototypical beta blocker 
      propranolol has been used to manage sympathetic hyperactivity in patients with RTT. 
      CASE PRESENTATION: A 13 year old girl with RTT was referred to the Centre for 
      Interventional Paediatric Psychopharmacology and Rare Diseases (CIPPRD), South 
      London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust. Her clinical picture included disordered 
      breathing with concomitant hyperventilation and apnoea, epilepsy, scoliosis, no QT 
      prolongation (QT/QTc [372/467 ms on automated electrocardiogram [ECG], but manually 
      calculated to be 440 ms]), no cardiac abnormalities (PR interval: 104 ms, QRS 
      duration: 78 ms), and generalised anxiety disorder (ICD-10-CM Diagnosis Code F41.1). 
      She was also constipated and was fed via percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). 
      To manage the dysautonomia, propranolol was given (5 mg and 10 mg) and in parallel 
      her physiological parameters, including heart rate, skin temperature and skin 
      transpiration, were monitored continuously for 24 h as she went about her activities 
      of daily living. Whilst her skin temperature increased and skin transpiration 
      decreased, unexpectedly there was a significant paradoxical increase in the 
      patient's average heart rate following propranolol treatment. CONCLUSION: Here, we 
      present a unique case of a paradoxical increase in heart rate response following 
      propranolol treatment for managing dysautonomia in a child with RTT. Further studies 
      are warranted to better understand the underlying dysautonomia in patients with RTT 
      and the impact this might have on treatment strategies in rare disorders such as 
      RTT.

TI  - Automatic ECG quality scoring methodology: mimicking human annotators.
PG  - 1479-89
LID - 10.1088/0967-3334/33/9/1479 [doi]
AB  - An algorithm to determine the quality of electrocardiograms (ECGs) can enable 
      inexperienced nurses and paramedics to record ECGs of sufficient diagnostic quality. 
      Previously, we proposed an algorithm for determining if ECG recordings are of 
      acceptable quality, which was entered in the PhysioNet Challenge 2011. In the 
      present work, we propose an improved two-step algorithm, which first rejects ECGs 
      with macroscopic errors (signal absent, large voltage shifts or saturation) and 
      subsequently quantifies the noise (baseline, powerline or muscular noise) on a 
      continuous scale. The performance of the improved algorithm was evaluated using the 
      PhysioNet Challenge database (1500 ECGs rated by humans for signal quality). We 
      achieved a classification accuracy of 92.3% on the training set and 90.0% on the 
      test set. The improved algorithm is capable of detecting ECGs with macroscopic 
      errors and giving the user a score of the overall quality. This allows the user to 
      assess the degree of noise and decide if it is acceptable depending on the purpose

AB  - The current state-of-the-art in automatic QRS detection methods show high robustness 
      and almost negligible error rates. In return, the methods are usually based on 
      machine-learning approaches that require sufficient computational resources. 
      However, simple-fast methods can also achieve high detection rates. There is a need 
      to develop numerically efficient algorithms to accommodate the new trend towards 
      battery-driven ECG devices and to analyze long-term recorded signals in a 
      time-efficient manner. A typical QRS detection method has been reduced to a basic 
      approach consisting of two moving averages that are calibrated by a knowledge base 
      using only two parameters. In contrast to high-accuracy methods, the proposed method 
      can be easily implemented in a digital filter design.

TI  - A low-complexity PPG pulse detection method for accurate estimation of the pulse 
      rate variability (PRV) during sudden decreases in the signal amplitude.
PG  - 035001
LID - 10.1088/1361-6579/ab7878 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: One of the biggest obstacles to reliable pulse rate variability (PRV) 
      analysis is the erroneous detection of photoplethysmographic (PPG) pulses. Among all 
      the disturbances that may hinder pulse detection, the ripples appearing at the 
      smooth segments of the PPG signal can become a serious problem when the amplitude of 
      the signal decreases considerably. OBJECTIVE: To present a low-complexity PPG pulse 
      detection method for reliable PRV estimation under conditions in which a sudden 
      decrease in the amplitude of the PPG signal can be expected. APPROACH: 2-min ECG and 
      PPG data (sampling rate at 500 Hz) were obtained from thirty healthy subjects, who 
      were asked to take a deep inspiration to provoke a sudden amplitude decrease (SAD) 
      of the PPG signal. After introducing a new parameter denoted as C, through which it 
      is possible to jump over the ripples hindering the accurate detection of the 
      systolic peaks, 500 Hz-sampled PPG recordings were down-sampled (400, 300, 200 and 
      100 Hz) to investigate the effect of the sampling rate on pulse detection. For ECG 
      recordings, automatic R-peak detection was performed by the Pan and Tompkins (PT) 
      algorithm, whereas PPG pulse detection was performed by the well-known maximum of 
      the first derivative (M1D) and the proposed method, once the C-value for best 
      detection results on 500 Hz-sampled PPG recordings was found. The agreement between 
      heart rate variability (HRV) and PRVs estimated from each pulse detection method was 
      assessed and the correlation between HRV and PRV-derived indexes was computed for 
      comparison. MAIN RESULTS: The proposed method can perform well on PPG-SAD segments, 
      provided that the proper value of the parameter C is used. Moreover, a good 
      agreement between HRV and PRV series, as well as lower relative errors and higher 
      correlation coefficients between HRV and PRV indexes, were achieved by the proposed 
      pulse detection method during SADs. SIGNIFICANCE: Results show that the proposed 
      method can dynamically adapt to circumstances in which a decrease in the amplitude 
      of the PPG signal can be expected, providing continuous systolic peak detection and 
      reliable PRV estimation under those conditions. However, more extensive testing 
      under a wide range of conditions is needed to perform a more rigorous validation.

TI  - Analysis of a Low-Cost EEG Monitoring System and Dry Electrodes toward Clinical Use 
      in the Neonatal ICU.
LID - 10.3390/s19112637 [doi]
LID - 2637
AB  - Electroencephalography (EEG) is an important clinical tool for monitoring 
      neurological health. However, the required equipment, expertise, and patient 
      preparation inhibits its use outside of tertiary care. Non-experts struggle to 
      obtain high-quality EEG due to its low amplitude and artefact susceptibility. Wet 
      electrodes are currently used, which require abrasive/conductive gels to reduce 
      skin-electrode impedance. Advances in dry electrodes, which do not require gels, 
      have simplified this process. However, the assessment of dry electrodes on neonates 
      is limited due to health and safety barriers. This study presents a simulation 
      framework for assessing the quality of EEG systems using a neonatal EEG database, 
      without the use of human participants. The framework is used to evaluate a low-cost 
      EEG acquisition system and compare performance of wet and dry (Micro Transdermal 
      Interface Platforms (MicroTIPs), g.tec-g.SAHARA) electrodes using accurately 
      acquired impedance models. A separate experiment assessing the electrodes on adult 
      participants was conducted to verify the simulation framework's efficacy. Dry 
      electrodes have higher impedance than wet electrodes, causing a reduction in signal 
      quality. However, MicroTIPs perform comparably to wet electrodes at the frontal 
      region and g.tec-g.SAHARA performs well at the occipital region. Using the 
      simulation framework, a 25dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) was obtained for the 
      low-cost EEG system. The tests on adults closely matched the simulated results.

TI  - An Enhanced Adaptive Filtering Method for Suppressing Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation 
      Artifact.
PG  - 471-478
LID - 10.1109/TBME.2016.2564642 [doi]
AB  - Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) must be interrupted for reliable rhythm analysis 
      in current automatic external defibrillators because of artifacts produced by chest 
      compressions. However, interruptions in CPR adversely affect the restoration of 
      spontaneous circulation and survival. Suppressing CPR artifacts by digital signal 
      processing techniques is a promising method to enable rhythm analysis during chest 
      compressions, which would eliminate CPR interruptions for rhythm analysis. Although 
      numerous methods have been developed to suppress CPR artifacts, the accuracy of 
      rhythm analysis is still inadequate due to the residual artifact components in the 
      filtered signal. This study proposes an enhanced adaptive filtering method to 
      suppress CPR artifacts. A total of 183 shockable and 453 nonshockable segments of 
      ECG signal, together with CPR-related reference signal, were extracted from 233 out 
      of hospital cardiac arrest patients. The method was optimized on a training set with 
      85 shockable and 211 nonshockable segments, and evaluated on a testing set with 98 
      shockable and 242 nonshockable segments. Compared with artifact corrupted ECG 
      signals, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) increased from -9.8 ± 12.5 to 
      11.2 ± 11.8 dB, and the accuracy was improved from 74.1% to 92.0% after filtering 
      with the proposed method. Compared with the traditional adaptive filter, the SNR was 
      improved by 1.7 dB and the accuracy was improved by 5.6 points. These results 
      indicated that the proposed method could effectively suppress the chest compression 
      related artifacts and improve the accuracy of rhythm analysis during uninterrupted 
      CPR.

AB  - Heart rate variability (HRV) has been recognised as a non-invasive method for 
      assessing cardiac autonomic regulation. Aiming to characterize HRV changes at labour 
      in women, we studied 10 minute ECG recordings from young mothers (n=30) at the third 
      trimester of pregnancy (P) or during augmentation of labour (L) (n=30). Data of the 
      L group were collected when no-contractions (L-NC) or the contractile activity (L-C) 
      was manifested. Accordingly, the inter-beat interval (IBI) time series were 
      processed to estimate relevant parameters of HRV such as the mean IBI (IBI¯), the 
      mean heart rate HR¯, the root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD) in IBIs, 
      the natural logarithm of high-frequency component (LnHF), the short-term scaling 
      parameters from detrended fluctuation and magnitude and sign analyses such as (α1, 
      α1(MAG), α1(SIGN)), and the sample entropy (SampEn). We found statistical 
      differences (p<0.05) for RMSSD among P and L-NC/L-C groups (25 ± 13 vs. 36 ± 14/34 ± 
      16 ms) and for LnHF between P and L-NC (5.37 ± 1.15 vs. 6.05 ± 0.86 ms(2)). 
      Likewise, we identified statistical differences (p<0.05) for α1(SIGN) among P and 
      L-NC/L-C groups (0.19 ± 0.20 vs. 0.32 ± 0.17/0.39 ± 0.13). By contrast, L-NC and L-C 
      groups showed statistical differences (p<0.05) in α1(MAG) (0.67 ± 0.12 vs. 0.79 ± 
      0.12), and SampEn (1.62 ± 0.26 vs. 1.20 ± 0.44). These results suggest that during 
      labour, despite preserving a concomitant non-linear influence, the maternal 
      short-term cardiac autonomic regulation becomes weakly anticorrelated (as indicated 
      by α1(SIGN)); furthermore, an increased vagally mediated activity is observed (as 
      indicated by RMSSD and LnHF), which may reflect a cholinergic pathway activation 
      owing to the use of oxytocin or the anti-inflammatory cholinergic response triggered 
      during labour.

      reflects the ANS response to an external stimulus responsible of pain, stress or 
      various emotions. We have previously developed the Analgesia Nociception Index 
      (ANI), based on HRV high frequency content estimation, which quantifies continuously 
      the vagal tone in order to guide analgesic drug administration during general 
      anesthesia. This technology has been largely validated during the peri-operative 
      period. Currently, ANI is obtained from a specific algorithm analyzing a time series 
      representing successive heart periods measured on the electrocardiographic (ECG) 
      signal. In the perspective of widening the application fields of this technology, in 
      particular for homecare monitoring, it has become necessary to simplify signal 
      acquisition by using e.g. a pulse plethysmographic (PPG) sensor. Even if Pulse Rate 
      Variability (PRV) analysis issued from PPG sensors has been shown to be unreliable 
      and a bad predictor of HRV analysis results, we have compared PRV and HRV both 
      estimated by ANI as well as HF and HF/(HF+LF) spectral analysis on both signals.

AB  - BACKGROUND: No direct comparison of current electrocardiogram (ECG) interpretation 
      programs exists. OBJECTIVE: Assess the accuracy of ECG interpretation programs in 
      detecting abnormal rhythms and flagging for priority review records with alterations 
      secondary to acute coronary syndrome (ACS). METHODS: More than 2,000 digital ECGs 
      from hospitals and databases in Europe, USA, and Australia, were obtained from 
      consecutive adult and pediatric patients and converted to 10 s analog samples that 
      were replayed on seven electrocardiographs and classified by the manufacturers' 
      interpretation programs. We assessed ability to distinguish sinus rhythm from 
      non-sinus rhythm, identify atrial fibrillation/flutter and other abnormal rhythms, 
      and accuracy in flagging results for priority review. If all seven programs' 
      interpretation statements did not agree, cases were reviewed by experienced 
      cardiologists. RESULTS: All programs could distinguish well between sinus and 
      non-sinus rhythms and could identify atrial fibrillation/flutter or other abnormal 
      rhythms. However, false-positive rates varied from 2.1% to 5.5% for non-sinus 
      rhythm, from 0.7% to 4.4% for atrial fibrillation/flutter, and from 1.5% to 3.0% for 
      other abnormal rhythms. False-negative rates varied from 12.0% to 7.5%, 9.9% to 
      2.7%, and 55.9% to 30.5%, respectively. Flagging of ACS varied by a factor of 2.5 
      between programs. Physicians flagged more ECGs for prompt review, but also showed 
      variance of around a factor of 2. False-negative values differed between programs by 
      a factor of 2 but was high for all (>50%). Agreement between programs and majority 
      reviewer decisions was 46-62%. CONCLUSIONS: Automatic interpretations of rhythms and 
      ACS differ between programs. Healthcare institutions should not rely on ECG software 
      "critical result" flags alone to decide the ACS workflow.

AB  - Multifractal properties of electrocardiographic inter-beat (RR) time-series offer 
      insight into its long-term correlation structure, independently of RR variability. 
      Here we quantify multifractal characteristics of RR data during 24-h 
      diurnal-nocturnal activity in healthy participants. We tested the hypotheses that 
      (1) age, gender and aerobic fitness influence RR multifractal properties, and that 
      (2) these are influenced by circadian variation. Seventy adults (39 males) aged 
      19-58 years and of various fitness levels were monitored using 24-h ECG. 
      Participants were dichotomized by median age and fitness for sub-group analysis. 
      Gender and fitness were independent of age (p = 0.1, p > 0.5). Younger/older group 
      ages were substantially different (p < 0.0005) and were independent of gender and 
      fitness. Multifractality was quantified using the probability spectrum of Hölder 
      exponents (h), from which modal h (h(*)) and the full-width and half-widths at 
      half-maximum measures (FWHM, HWHM+, and HWHM-) were derived. FWHM decreased (p = 
      0.004) and h(*) increased (p = 0.011) in older people, indicating diminished 
      long-range RR correlations and weaker anti-persistent behavior. Anti-persistent 
      correlation (h(*)) was strongest in the youngest/fittest individuals and weakest in 
      the oldest/least fit individuals (p = 0.015). Long-range correlation (HWHM+/FWHM) 
      was strongest in the fittest males and weakest in the least fit females (p = 
      0.007-0.033). Multifractal RR characteristics in our healthy participants showed 
      strong age-dependence, with diminished long-range anti-persistent correlation in 
      older people. Circadian variation of these characteristics was influenced by fitness 
      and gender: fitter males and females of all ages had the greatest degree of 
      multifractality or long-range order. Multifractal characterization appears to be a 
      useful method for exploring the physiological basis of long-term correlation 
      structure in RR time-series as well as the benefits thereon of physical fitness 
      training.

TI  - Heart sound segmentation based on homomorphic filtering.
PG  - 351-359
AB  - BACKGROUND: Phonocardiography, the digital recording of heart sounds, is becoming 
      increasingly popular as a primary detection system for diagnosing heart disorders 
      and is relatively inexpensive. The electrocardiogram (ECG) is often used when 
      recording the phonocardiogram in order to help identify the systolic and diastolic 
      components. In this study, a heart sound segmentation algorithm has been developed 
      which automatically separates the heart sound signal into these component parts. 
      METHODS: 100 patients with normal and abnormal heart sounds were studied. The 
      algorithm uses homomorphic filtering to produce time-domain intensity envelopes of 
      the heart sounds and separates the sounds into four overlapping parts: the first 
      heart sound, the systolic period, the second heart sound and the diastolic period. 
      RESULTS: The performance of the algorithm was evaluated using 14,000 cardiac periods 
      from 100 digital phonocardiographic recordings, including normal and abnormal heart 
      sounds. In tests, the algorithm was over 93 percent correct in detecting the first 
      and second heart sounds. CONCLUSION: The automatic segmentation algorithm presented 
      uses wavelet decomposition and reconstruction to select a suitable frequency band 
      for envelope calculations and has been found to be effective in segmenting 
      phonocardiogram signals into four component parts without using an ECG reference.

AB  - Biosignals such as electrocardiograms (ECG), electroencephalograms (EEG), and 
      electromyograms (EMG), are important noninvasive measurements useful for making 
      diagnostic decisions. Recently, considerable research has been conducted in order to 
      potentially automate signal classification for assisting in disease diagnosis. 
      However, the biosignal type (ECG, EEG, EMG or other) needs to be known prior to the 
      classification process. If the given biosignal is of an unknown type, none of the 
      existing methodologies can be utilized. In this paper, a blind biosignal 
      classification model (B(2)SC Model) is proposed in order to identify the source 
      biosignal type automatically, and thus ultimately benefit the diagnostic decision. 
      The approach employs time series algorithms for constructing the model. It uses a 
      dynamic time warping (DTW) algorithm with clustering to discover the similarity 
      between two biosignals, and consequently classifies disease without prior knowledge 
      of the source signal type. The empirical experiments presented in this paper 
      demonstrate the effectiveness of the method as well as the scalability of the 
      approach.

AB  - Telehealthcare has become increasingly popular in clinical practice as a means of 
      providing ubiquitous healthcare through long-term informative interactions and 
      health monitoring. We have delivered a synchronized telehealthcare program since 
      2009. We have implemented a web-based clinical decision support system with a 
      knowledge-based electrocardiogram (ECG) recognition mechanism as an augmentation 
      service to assist medical practitioners doing decision making in clinical practice. 
      To evaluate the capability and usage limits of this automatic ECG interpretation, 
      the aim of this study was to validate the stability and robustness of proposed 
      mechanism using stress testing through six simulation scenarios. According to 
      experimental results, both of the processing items and processing time augmented 
      steadily by the resource of hardware. Besides, under the cross-validation using 
      327,058 ECG signals from our telehealthcare program, the recognition classifiers 
      yielded 86.8% accuracy in sinus detection and 88.4% accuracy in atrial fibrillation 
      detection. In the future, this prominent mechanism of automatic ECG interpretation 
      could widely offer high accessibility in the field of medical service. The findings 
      of the present study also encourage and augment further support to implementation of 
      screening and monitoring as part of telehealthcare.

AB  - AIM: To study the influence of patient characteristics and unit ergonomics and human 
      factors on the time to initiation of CPR. METHODS: A single center study of 
      children, 0 to 21 years old, admitted to an ICU who experienced cardiopulmonary 
      arrest (CPA) requiring >1 min of chest compressions. Time of CPA was determined by 
      analysis of continuous ECG, plethysmography, arterial blood pressure, and end-tidal 
      CO(2) (EtCO(2)) waveforms. Initiation of CPR was identified by the onset of cyclic 
      artifact in the ECG waveform. Patient characteristics and unit ergonomics and human 
      factors were examined including CPA cause, identification on the High-Risk Checklist 
      (HRC), existing monitoring, ICU type, time of day, nursing shift change, and 
      outcome. RESULTS: The median time from CPA to initiation of CPR was 50.5 s (IQR 26.5 
      to 127.5) in 36 CPAs. Forty-seven percent of patients experienced time from CPA to 
      initiation of CPR of >1 min. There was no difference in CPA cause, ICU type, time of 
      day, or nursing shift change. CONCLUSION: Nearly half of pediatric patients who 
      experienced CPA in an ICU setting did not meet AHA guidelines for early initiation 
      of CPR. This is an opportunity to study the recognition phase of CPA using 
      continuous monitoring data with the aim of improving the understanding of and 
      factors contributing to delays in initiation of CPR.

TI  - Video-based respiration monitoring with automatic region of interest detection.
PG  - 100-14
LID - 10.1088/0967-3334/37/1/100 [doi]
AB  - Vital signs monitoring is ubiquitous in clinical environments and emerging in 
      home-based healthcare applications. Still, since current monitoring methods require 
      uncomfortable sensors, respiration rate remains the least measured vital sign. In 
      this paper, we propose a video-based respiration monitoring method that 
      automatically detects a respiratory region of interest (RoI) and signal using a 
      camera. Based on the observation that respiration induced chest/abdomen motion is an 
      independent motion system in a video, our basic idea is to exploit the intrinsic 
      properties of respiration to find the respiratory RoI and extract the respiratory 
      signal via motion factorization. We created a benchmark dataset containing 148 video 
      sequences obtained on adults under challenging conditions and also neonates in the 
      neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). The measurements obtained by the proposed video 
      respiration monitoring (VRM) method are not significantly different from the 
      reference methods (guided breathing or contact-based ECG; p-value  =  0.6), and 
      explain more than 99% of the variance of the reference values with low limits of 
      agreement (-2.67 to 2.81 bpm). VRM seems to provide a valid solution to ECG in 
      confined motion scenarios, though precision may be reduced for neonates. More 
      studies are needed to validate VRM under challenging recording conditions, including 
      upper-body motion types.

TI  - Slow-Wave Sleep Estimation for Healthy Subjects and OSA Patients Using R-R 
      Intervals.
PG  - 119-128
LID - 10.1109/JBHI.2017.2712861 [doi]
AB  - We developed an automatic slow-wave sleep (SWS) detection algorithm that can be 
      applied to groups of healthy subjects and patients with obstructive sleep apnea 
      (OSA). This algorithm detected SWS based on autonomic activations derived from the 
      heart rate variations of a single sensor. An autonomic stability, which is an SWS 
      characteristic, was evaluated and quantified using R-R intervals from an 
      electrocardiogram (ECG). The thresholds and the heuristic rule to determine SWS were 
      designed based on the physiological backgrounds for sleep process and distribution 
      across the night. The automatic algorithm was evaluated based on a fivefold cross 
      validation using data from 21 healthy subjects and 24 patients with OSA. An 
      epoch-by-epoch (30 s) analysis showed that the overall Cohen's kappa, accuracy, 
      sensitivity, and specificity of our method were 0.56, 89.97%, 68.71%, and 93.75%, 
      respectively. SWS-related information, including SWS duration (min) and percentage 
      (%), were also calculated. A significant correlation in these parameters was found 
      between automatic and polysomnography scorings. Compared with similar methods, the 
      proposed algorithm convincingly discriminated SWS from non-SWS. The simple method 
      using only R-R intervals has the potential to be utilized in mobile and wearable 
      devices that can easily measure this information. Moreover, when combined with other 
      sleep staging methods, the proposed method is expected to be applicable to long-term 
      sleep monitoring at home and ambulatory environments.

TI  - Ventricular fibrillation recorded and analysed within an area the size of a mobile 
      phone: could it enable cardiac arrest recognition?
PG  - 394-399
LID - 10.1097/MEJ.0000000000000473 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recognition of out-of-hospital-cardiac arrests (OHCAs) at emergency 
      medical communication centres is based on questions of OHCA symptoms, resulting in 
      50-80% accuracy rates. However, OHCAs might be recognized more promptly using 
      'rhythm-based' recognition, whereby a victim's cardiac rhythm is recorded with 
      mobile phone technology that analyses and transmits recordings to emergency medical 
      communication centres for further interpretation. OBJECTIVE: To examine whether the 
      quality of normal cardiac rhythm and the rhythm with the best prognosis in OHCA, 
      ventricular fibrillation (VF), is sufficient for 'rhythm-based' OHCA recognition 
      when recorded within a mobile phone-sized device. PATIENTS AND METHODS: mid-sternum 
      within an area the size of a mobile phone and analysed by automated external 
      defibrillator (AED) software and two cardiologists. The rhythms were categorized as 
      shockable or nonshockable. The cardiologists assessed the quality of the recordings. 
      RESULTS: The AED software correctly analysed all normal rhythms and 15 of 22 VF 
      rhythms. The VF duration was too short for automatic detection in seven cases. The 
      cardiologists analysed all the normal rhythms and VF sequences correctly and graded 
      them as high quality. CONCLUSION: The recordings of normal ECG rhythm and VF within 
      an area the size of a mobile phone are of sufficient quality and could be used in 
      'rhythm-based' OHCA recognition. The VF period was too short for an accurate 
      analysis by the AED software in some cases.

TI  - [Sedative effect of lavender during physical loads].
PG  - 665-9
AB  - There was investigated the dynamics of the functional state of the cardiovascular 
      system of students after bicycle exercise load, followed by cold inhalation of 
      lavender oil. Examinations were performed in the first half of the day at the same 
      time, three times: 1) before exercise load (the state ofphysiological norm); 2) 
      immediately after the load for 15minutes on the bike training apparatus «Proteus Pec 
      3320» in the third position, followed by aromatherapy; 3) at the 15 minute of the 
      post-exercise load recovery period. Aromacorrection was executed by the method of 
      cold inhalation. Registration and analysis of ECG by variation pulsometry was 
      implemented by hardware-software complex, which combined the portable 
      electrocardiograph of brand “Bio-Arm 001”, a personal computer and software for 
      automatic recording and analysis of ECG with the method of variation pulsometry 
      according to parameters of the cardiac rhythm. In the absence of correction factors 
      (control group) the work on a stationary bike was established to be accompanied by 
      significant deviations of all investigated parameters of the heart rhythm, the 
      majority of which persisted at the 15 minute of the post-exercise load period also. 
      Inhalation with the essential lavender oil (control group) under the bicycle load 
      has a sedative effect on the activity of regulatory mechanisms of heart rhythm 
      students. Releasing of the increased sympathetic influence on heart rate, initiated 
      by the physical activity, it facilitates the rapid recovery of the functional state 
      of the body in the post-exercise load period, thereby promoting its tolerance to 
      effects of stress factors.

AB  - Biomedical time series clustering that automatically groups a collection of time 
      series according to their internal similarity is of importance for medical record 
      management and inspection such as bio-signals archiving and retrieval. In this 
      paper, a novel framework that automatically groups a set of unlabelled multichannel 
      biomedical time series according to their internal structural similarity is 
      proposed. Specifically, we treat a multichannel biomedical time series as a document 
      and extract local segments from the time series as words. We extend a topic model, 
      i.e., the Hierarchical probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (H-pLSA), which was 
      originally developed for visual motion analysis to cluster a set of unlabelled 
      multichannel time series. The H-pLSA models each channel of the multichannel time 
      series using a local pLSA in the first layer. The topics learned in the local pLSA 
      are then fed to a global pLSA in the second layer to discover the categories of 
      multichannel time series. Experiments on a dataset extracted from multichannel 
      Electrocardiography (ECG) signals demonstrate that the proposed method performs 
      better than previous state-of-the-art approaches and is relatively robust to the 
      variations of parameters including length of local segments and dictionary size. 
      Although the experimental evaluation used the multichannel ECG signals in a 
      biometric scenario, the proposed algorithm is a universal framework for multichannel 
      biomedical time series clustering according to their structural similarity, which 
      has many applications in biomedical time series management.

TI  - Attitude of resident doctors towards intensive care units' alarm settings.
PG  - 522-4
LID - 10.4103/0019-5049.72640 [doi]
AB  - Intensive care unit (ICU) monitors have alarm options to intimate the staff of 
      critical incidents but these alarms needs to be adjusted in every patient. With this 
      objective in mind, this study was done among resident doctors, with the aim of 
      assessing the existing attitude among resident doctors towards ICU alarm settings. 
      This study was conducted among residents working at ICU of a multispeciality centre, 
      with the help of a printed questionnaire. The study involved 80 residents. All 
      residents were in full agreement on routine use of ECG, pulse oximeter, capnograph 
      and NIBP monitoring. 86% residents realised the necessity of monitoring oxygen 
      concentration, apnoea monitoring and expired minute ventilation monitoring. 87% PGs 
      and 70% SRs routinely checked alarm limits for various parameters. 50% PGs and 46.6% 
      SRs set these alarm limits. The initial response to an alarm among all the residents 
      was to disable the alarm temporarily and try to look for a cause. 92% of PGs and 98% 
      of SRs were aware of alarms priority and colour coding. 55% residents believed that 
      the alarm occurred due to patient disturbance, 15% believed that alarm was due to 
      technical problem with monitor/sensor and 30% thought it was truly related to 
      patient's clinical status. 82% residents set the alarms by themselves, 10% believed 
      that alarms should be adjusted by nurse, 4% believed the technical staff should take 
      responsibility of setting alarm limits and 4% believed that alarm levels should be 
      pre-adjusted by the manufacturer. We conclude that although alarms are an important, 
      indispensable, and lifesaving feature, they can be a nuisance and can compromise 
      quality and safety of care by frequent false positive alarms. We should be familiar 
      of the alarm modes, check and reset the alarm settings at regular interval or after 
      a change in clinical status of the patient.

AB  - This paper introduces a methodology for the detection of sleep apnea based on 
      single-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) of the patient. In the proposed technique, each 
      QRS complex of the ECG signal is approximated using a linear combination of the 
      lower order Hermite basis functions. The coefficients of the Hermite expansion are 
      then used to discriminate the apnea and normal segments along with three features 
      based on R-R time series (mean of R-R intervals, the standard deviation of R-R 
      intervals) and energy in the error of the QRS approximation. To perform 
      classification between the apnea and normal segments, four different types of 
      classifiers (K-nearest neighbor (KNN), multilayer perceptron neural network (MLPNN), 
      support vector machine (SVM), and least-square support vector machine (LS-SVM)) are 
      used in this work. In total, 70 ECG recordings from Apnea-ECG dataset are used in 
      this study and the performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated based on the 
      minute-by-minute (per-segment) classification, and per-recording (where the entire 
      ECG recording of a subject is discriminated as the apnea or normal one) 
      classification. By considering the events of apnea and hypopnea together, an 
      accuracy of about 84% is achieved on the minute-by-minute basis classification using 
      the LS-SVM classifier with the Gaussian radial basis function (RBF) kernel. On the 
      other hand, an accuracy of about 97.14% is achieved for per-recording classification 
      using the SVM, and LS-SVM classifiers. From the results, it is observed that the 
      proposed methodology provides comparable accuracy with the methods existing in the 
      literature at reduced computational cost due to the lesser number of features 
      selected for the classification.

AB  - Low-power wearable recording of biopotentials requires acquisition front-ends with 
      high common-mode rejection for interference suppression and adjustable gain to 
      provide an optimum signal range to a cascading analogue-to-digital stage. A 
      microcontroller operated double-differential (DD) recording setup and automatic gain 
      control circuit (AGC) are discussed which reject common-mode interference and 
      provide tunable gain, thus compensating for imbalance and variation in electrode 
      interface impedance. Custom-designed variable gain amplifiers (ASIC) are used as 
      part of the recording setup. The circuit gain and balance is set by the timing of 
      microcontroller generated clock signals. Measured results are presented which 
      confirm that improved common-mode rejection is achieved compared to a single 
      differential amplifier in the presence of input network imbalance. Practical 
      measured examples further validate gain control suitable for biopotential recording 
      and power-line rejection for wearable ECG and EMG recording. The prototype front-end 
      consumes 318 μW including amplifiers and microcontroller.

AB  - Heart rate and respiration display fluctuations that are interlinked by central 
      regulatory mechanisms of the autonomic nervous system (ANS). Joint assessment of 
      respiratory time series along with heart rate variability (HRV) may therefore 
      provide information on ANS dysfunction. The aim of this study was to investigate 
      cardio-respiratory interaction in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), a 
      neurodegenerative disorder that is associated with progressive ANS dysfunction. 
      Short-term ECG and respiration were recorded in 25 PD patients and 28 healthy 
      controls during rest. To assess ANS dysfunction we analyzed joint symbolic dynamics 
      of heart rate and respiration, cardio-respiratory synchrograms along with heart rate 
      variability. Neither HRV nor cardio-respiratory synchrograms were significantly 
      altered in PD patients. Symbolic analysis, however, identified a significant 
      reduction in cardio-respiratory interactions in PD patients compared to healthy 
      controls (16 ± 3.6 % vs. 20 ± 6.1 %; p= 0.02). In conclusion, joint symbolic 
      analysis of cardio-respiratory dynamics provides a powerful tool to detect early 
      signs of autonomic nervous system dysfunction in Parkinson's disease patients at an 
      early stage of the disease.

TI  - 320-row coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) with automatic exposure 
      control (AEC): effect of 100 kV versus 120 kV on image quality and dose exposure.
PG  - 618-25
LID - 10.1007/s11547-016-0643-4 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To compare the impact of a 100 kV tube voltage protocol to 120 kV in terms 
      of image quality and radiation dose by a 320 row coronary computed tomography 
      angiography (CCTA) with automatic exposure control (AEC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: 
      Using a propensity matched analysis we compared a group of 135 patients scanned 
      using a 100 kV tube voltage protocol with a group of 135 subjects scanned employing 
      a 120 kV tube voltage setting. In all subjects the heart rate (HR) was <65 bpm and 
      all CT scans were acquired using a prospective ECG gating and AEC strategy. Mean 
      effective radiation dose and subjective and objective (Noise or N, signal to noise 
      ratio or SNR, contrast to noise ratio or CNR) image quality, were evaluated. 
      Subjective quality was assessed by two experienced radiologists using a 5-point 
      scale (0: non diagnostic-4: excellent) using the 15-segment American Heart 
      Association (AHA) coronary artery classification. RESULTS: Mean effective dose and 
      noise were non significantly different between the two groups: mean effective dose 
      was 2.89 ± 0.7 mSv in the 100 kV group and 2.80 ± 0.57 mSv in the 120 kV group 
      (p = 0.25) while noise was 28.9 ± 3.3 in the 120 kV group and 29.05 ± 3.6 in the 
      100 kV group (p = 0.72). Both SNR and CNR were significantly higher in the 100 kV 
      group than in the 120 kV group. This data agrees with the evidence that subjective 
      quality was significantly higher in the 100 kV group in the middle and distal 
      segmental classes. CONCLUSION: Our study shows that, in using a 320 row CCTA with 
      AEC strategy it is better to employ a 100 kV tube voltage protocol because compared 
      to 120 kV tube voltage setting, it appears to significantly improve both subjective 
      and objective image quality without decreasing the mean effective radiation dose.

AB  - This paper presents a novel maximum margin clustering method with immune evolution 
      (IEMMC) for automatic diagnosis of electrocardiogram (ECG) arrhythmias. This 
      diagnostic system consists of signal processing, feature extraction, and the IEMMC 
      algorithm for clustering of ECG arrhythmias. First, raw ECG signal is processed by 
      an adaptive ECG filter based on wavelet transforms, and waveform of the ECG signal 
      is detected; then, features are extracted from ECG signal to cluster different types 
      of arrhythmias by the IEMMC algorithm. Three types of performance evaluation 
      indicators are used to assess the effect of the IEMMC method for ECG arrhythmias, 
      such as sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. Compared with K-means and iterSVR 
      algorithms, the IEMMC algorithm reflects better performance not only in clustering 
      result but also in terms of global search ability and convergence ability, which 
      proves its effectiveness for the detection of ECG arrhythmias.

TI  - Performance of an atrial fibrillation detection algorithm using continuous pulse 
      wave monitoring.
PG  - e12615
LID - 10.1111/anec.12615 [doi]
LID - e12615
AB  - BACKGROUND: Detecting asymptomatic and undiagnosed atrial fibrillation (AF) is 
      increasingly important. Recently, we developed a wristwatch-based pulse wave monitor 
      (PWM; Seiko Epson, Japan) capable of long-term recording, with an automatic 
      diagnosis algorithm that uses frequency-based pulse wave analysis. The aim of this 
      study was to evaluate the validity of continuous pulse wave monitoring for detection 
      of AF. METHODS: During the electrophysiological study (EPS) in patients with AF, 
      simultaneous pulse wave monitoring and Holter electrocardiograms (ECG) were recorded 
      (n = 136, mean age 62.7 ± 10.9 years). The diagnostic accuracy of the PWM for AF was 
      compared to the Holter ECG diagnosis. Standard performance metrics (sensitivity 
      [Se], specificity [Sp], positive predictive value [PPV], and negative predictive 
      value [NPV]) were calculated. The duration-based measurements were based on the 
      diagnosis concordance ratios for the duration of time between diagnosis detected by 
      the PWM and true diagnosis by the Holter ECG (AF or not AF). The episode-based 
      performance metrics were based on the proportion of episodes appropriately detected 
      with the PWM relative to episodes determined by the Holter ECG. RESULTS: The total 
      recording time was 1,542,770 s (AF: 270,945 s). A high diagnostic Sp (patient 
      average: 96.4%, cumulative: 97.7%) and NPV (patient average: 95.1%, cumulative: 
      96.8%) were obtained in the duration-based results. In the episode-based metrics, 
      all indices significantly improved with longer AF episode durations. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Continuous pulse wave monitoring can provide accurate and dependable information to 
      aid in AF diagnosis. A high validity in confirming freedom from AF was shown by a 
      high NPV.

TI  - The "Chaos Theory" and nonlinear dynamics in heart rate variability analysis: does 
      it work in short-time series in patients with coronary heart disease?
PG  - 130-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dynamic analysis techniques may quantify abnormalities in heart rate 
      variability (HRV) based on nonlinear and fractal analysis (chaos theory). The 
      article emphasizes clinical and prognostic significance of dynamic changes in 
      short-time series applied on patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) during the 
      exercise electrocardiograph (ECG) test. METHODS: The subjects were included in the 
      series after complete cardiovascular diagnostic data. Series of R-R and ST-T 
      intervals were obtained from exercise ECG data after sampling digitally. The range 
      rescaled analysis method determined the fractal dimension of the intervals. To 
      quantify fractal long-range correlation's properties of heart rate variability, the 
      detrended fluctuation analysis technique was used. Approximate entropy (ApEn) was 
      applied to quantify the regularity and complexity of time series, as well as 
      unpredictability of fluctuations in time series. RESULTS: It was found that the 
      short-term fractal scaling exponent (alpha(1)) is significantly lower in patients 
      with CHD (0.93 +/- 0.07 vs 1.09 +/- 0.04; P < 0.001). The patients with CHD had 
      higher fractal dimension in each exercise test program separately, as well as in 
      exercise program at all. ApEn was significant lower in CHD group in both RR and ST-T 
      ECG intervals (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The nonlinear dynamic methods could have 
      clinical and prognostic applicability also in short-time ECG series. Dynamic 
      analysis based on chaos theory during the exercise ECG test point out the 
      multifractal time series in CHD patients who loss normal fractal characteristics and 
      regularity in HRV. Nonlinear analysis technique may complement traditional ECG 
      analysis.

AB  - T-wave amplitude (TWA) has been proposed as a marker of the innervation of the 
      myocardium. Until now, TWA has been calculated manually or with poor algorithms, 
      thus making its use not efficient in a clinical environment. We introduce a new 
      wavelet-based algorithm for the delineation QRS complexes and T-waves, and the 
      automatic calculation of TWA. When validated in the MIT/BIH Arrhythmia database, the 
      QRS detector achieved sensitivity and positive predictive value of 99.84% and 
      99.87%, respectively. The algorithm was validated also on the QT database and it 
      achieved sensitivity of 99.50% for T-peak detection. In addition, the algorithm 
      achieved delineation accuracy that is similar to the differences in delineation 
      between expert cardiologists. We applied the algorithm for the evaluation of the 
      influence in TWA of anticholinergic and antiadrenergic drugs (i.e., atropine and 
      metoprolol) for healthy subjects. We found that the TWA decreased significantly with 
      atropine and that metoprolol caused a significant increase in TWA, thus confirming 
      the clinical hypothesis that the TWA is a marker of the innervation of the 
      myocardium. The results of this paper show that the proposed algorithm can be used 
      as a useful and efficient tool in clinical practice for the automatic calculation of 
      TWA and its interpretation as a non-invasive marker of the autonomic ventricular 
      innervation.

TI  - A Clinical Prediction Model for Postcardiac Surgery Atrial Fibrillation in an Asian 
      Population.
PG  - 283-9
LID - 10.1213/ANE.0000000000001384 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Postoperative atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with increased 
      morbidity, mortality, and resource utilization. Current prediction models for 
      postoperative AF are based primarily on Western populations. In this study, we 
      sought to develop a clinical prediction rule for postcardiac surgery AF for a 
      multiethnic Asian population. METHODS: Two thousand one hundred sixty-eight patients 
      undergoing coronary artery bypass graft or valve surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass 
      were prospectively enrolled in this observational study between August 2008 and July 
      2012 at Singapore's 2 national heart centers. Postoperative AF was defined as an 
      irregularly irregular electrocardiogram rhythm without identifiable P wave after 
      surgery and before hospital discharge that lasted more than an hour, or affected 
      hemodynamics (ie, systolic blood pressure <90 mm Hg or mean arterial blood pressure 
      <60 mm Hg), or required medical treatment. Patients had continuous telemetry 
      monitoring for at least 72 hours while in the intensive care or high-dependency 
      units postoperatively. Subsequently, patients had a 12-lead electrocardiogram daily 
      and when symptomatic. Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine 
      significant predictors of postcardiac surgery AF, and a scoring system was 
      developed. The model was internally validated in an additional 500 patients. 
      RESULTS: Postoperative AF occurred in 17.3% of patients, with a peak occurrence in 
      the first 72 hours after surgery. Multivariate logistic regression analysis 
      identified age ≥65 years (odds ratio [OR], 1.44; 95% confidence interval [CI], 
      1.11-1.85, P = 0.005), history of AF (OR, 3.65; 95% CI, 2.52-5.30, P < 0.001), 
      inotrope use (OR, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.31-2.32, P < 0.001), cardiopulmonary bypass 
      duration >120 minutes (OR, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.47-2.52, P < 0.001), and Chinese 
      ethnicity (Chinese versus Indian OR, 2.09; 95% CI, 1.28-3.41, P = 0.003) or Malay 
      (Malay versus Indian OR, 2.43; 95% CI, 1.36-4.05, P = 0.002) to be independently 
      associated with postoperative AF. The area under the receiver-operator 
      characteristic curve of the model was 0.704 (95% CI, 0.674-0.734). Internal 
      validation produced an area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve of 
      0.756 (95% CI, 0.690-0.821). CONCLUSIONS: Clinical risk factors for AF after cardiac 
      surgery in an Asian population are similar to that reported from primarily Western 
      populations, but specific ethnicity influences susceptibility.

TI  - Temporal disorganization of circadian rhythmicity and sleep-wake regulation in 
      mechanically ventilated patients receiving continuous intravenous sedation.
PG  - 1105-14
LID - 10.5665/sleep.1998 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Sleep is regulated by circadian and homeostatic processes and is highly 
      organized temporally. Our study was designed to determine whether this organization 
      is preserved in patients receiving mechanical ventilation (MV) and intravenous 
      sedation. DESIGN: Observational study. SETTING: Academic medical intensive care 
      unit. PATIENTS: Critically ill patients receiving MV and intravenous sedation. 
      METHODS: Continuous polysomnography (PSG) was initiated an average of 2.0 (1.0, 3.0) 
      days after ICU admission and continued ≥ 36 h or until the patient was extubated. 
      Sleep staging and power spectral analysis were performed using standard approaches. 
      We also calculated the electroencephalography spectral edge frequency 95% SEF₉₅, a 
      parameter that is normally higher during wakefulness than during sleep. Circadian 
      rhythmicity was assessed in 16 subjects through the measurement of aMT6s in urine 
      samples collected hourly for 24-48 hours. Light intensity at the head of the bed was 
      measured continuously. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: We analyzed 819.7 h of PSG 
      recordings from 21 subjects. REM sleep was identified in only 2/21 subjects. Slow 
      wave activity lacked the normal diurnal and ultradian periodicity and homeostatic 
      decline found in healthy adults. In nearly all patients, SEF₉₅ was consistently low 
      without evidence of diurnal rhythmicity (median 6.3 [5.3, 7.8] Hz, n = 18). A 
      circadian rhythm of aMT6s excretion was present in most (13/16, 81.3%) patients, but 
      only 4 subjects had normal timing. Comparison of the SEF₉₅ during the 
      melatonin-based biological night and day revealed no difference between the 2 
      periods (P = 0.64). CONCLUSIONS: The circadian rhythms and PSG of patients receiving 
      mechanical ventilation and intravenous sedation exhibit pronounced temporal 
      disorganization. The finding that most subjects exhibited preserved, but phase 
      delayed, excretion of aMT6s suggests that the circadian pacemaker of such patients 
      may be free-running.

PG  - 718-21
LID - 10.1016/j.hlc.2011.08.004 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Our experience with the use of Warden's procedure for the repair of 
      sinus venosus ASD with anomalous right upper pulmonary venous connection. METHOD: 
      Fifty-eight patients had Warden's procedure from September 2008 to May 2011. The 
      demographic data, preoperative and postoperative ECG, aortic cross-clamp time, 
      cardiopulmonary bypass time, Holter monitoring, complications length of ICU and 
      hospital stay were analysed. RESULT: The male to female ratio was 1:1. The median 
      age was 10.9 years (range 2-48 years). Preoperatively all patients were in sinus 
      rhythm. Twenty-six patients had associated left superior vena cava and two patients 
      had also Tucker's procedure at the same time. The mean follow up was 1.2 years 
      (range 1 months-2.8 years). Postoperative Holter monitoring showed sinus rhythm in 
      all the patients. The mean CPB time was 83.6 min (range 54-163 min), mean aortic 
      cross-clamp time was 48.0 min (range 22-112 min), mean ICU stay was 1.26 days (range 
      1-4 days) and length of hospital was 8.3 days (range 5-13 days) Postoperative 
      echocardiography showed less than 1 mm Hg gradient across the SVC-RA appendage 
      anastomotic site in all the patients. No mortality was recorded. CONCLUSION: This is 
      the largest reported series of Warden's procedure in the literature till date. It is 
      known from other studies that sinus node dysfunction and conversion to junctional 
      nodal rhythm were quite a concern with the conventional techniques and Warden's 
      procedure specifically avoids these problems.

TI  - QTc interval screening for cardiac risk in methadone treatment of opioid dependence.
PG  - CD008939
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD008939.pub2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Methadone represents today the gold standard of efficacy for the 
      pharmacological treatment of opioid dependence. Methadone, like many other 
      medications, has been implicated in the prolongation of the rate-corrected QT (QTc) 
      interval of the electrocardiogram (ECG), which is considered a marker for 
      arrhythmias such as torsade de pointes (TdP). Indications on the association between 
      methadone, even at therapeutic dosages, and TdP or sudden cardiac death have been 
      reported. On these bases, consensus and recommendations involving QTc screening of 
      patients receiving methadone treatment have been developed to identify patients with 
      QTc above the thresholds considered at risk for cardiac arrhythmias, and they 
      provide these individuals with alternative treatment (reduction of methadone dosage; 
      provision of alternative opioid agonist treatment; treatment of associated risk 
      factors). OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy and acceptability of QTc screening 
      for preventing cardiac-related morbidity and mortality in methadone-treated opioid 
      dependents. SEARCH METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL (to April 2013), the 
      Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), The Cochrane Library 
      Cochrane Drug and Alcohol Review Group Specialised Register (Issue 3, 2013), main 
      electronic sources of ongoing trials, specific trial databases and reference lists 
      of all relevant papers. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), 
      controlled clinical trials (CCTs) and non-randomised studies (cohort studies, 
      controlled before and after studies, interrupted time series studies, case control 
      studies) examining the efficacy of QTc screening for the prevention of 
      methadone-related mortality and morbidity in opioid addicts. DATA COLLECTION AND 
      ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently screened and extracted data from studies. 
      MAIN RESULTS: The search strategy led to the identification of 872 records. Upon 
      full-text assessment, no study was found to meet the quality criteria used for this 
      review. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: It is not possible to draw any conclusions about the 
      effectiveness of QTc screening strategies for preventing cardiac morbidity/mortality 
      in methadone-treated opioid addicts. Research efforts should focus on strengthening 
      the evidence about the effectiveness of widespread implementation of such strategies 
      and clarifying the associated benefits and harms.

TI  - Risk stratification for implantable cardioverter defibrillator therapy: the role of 
      the wearable cardioverter-defibrillator.
PG  - 2230-42
LID - 10.1093/eurheartj/eht167 [doi]
AB  - The benefit of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) therapy depends upon 
      appropriate evaluation of a persisting risk of sudden death and estimation of the 
      patient's overall survival. Assessment of a stable and unchangeable arrhythmogenic 
      substrate is often difficult. Structural abnormality and ventricular dysfunction, 
      the two major risk parameters, may recover, and heart failure symptoms can improve 
      so that ICD therapy may not be indicated. Risk stratification can take time while 
      the patient continues to be at high risk of arrhythmic death, and patients may need 
      temporary bridging by a defibrillator in cases of interrupted ICD therapy. The 
      wearable cardioverter-defibrillator (WCD) combines a long-term electrocardiogram 
      (ECG)-monitoring system with an external automatic defibrillator. The LIfeVest® 
      (ZOLL, Pittsburgh, PA, USA) is composed of a garment, containing two defibrillation 
      patch electrodes on the back, and an elastic belt with a front-defibrillation patch 
      electrode and four non-adhesive ECG electrodes, connected to a monitoring and 
      defibrillation unit. The WCD is a safe and effective tool to terminate ventricular 
      tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation events, unless a conscious patient withholds 
      shock delivery. It may be used in patients in the early phase after acute myocardial 
      infarction with poor left ventricular function, after acute coronary 
      revascularization procedures (percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery 
      bypass grafting) and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (≤35%), in patients 
      with acute heart failure in non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy of uncertain aetiology and 
      prognosis. The WCD may be helpful in subjects with syncope of assumed 
      tachyarrhythmia origin or in patients with inherited arrhythmia syndromes. The WCD 
      may replace ICD implantation in patients waiting for heart transplantation or who 
      need a ventricular-assist device. This review describes the technical details and 
      characteristics of the WCD, discusses its various potential applications, and 
      reports the currently available experience with the wearable defibrillator.

TI  - The implementation of an apnea-based perinatal stress calculator.
PG  - 6000-6003
LID - 10.1109/EMBC.2019.8856955 [doi]
AB  - Early life stress in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) predisposes premature 
      infants to adverse health outcomes. Although those patients experience frequent 
      apneas and sleep-wake disturbances during their hospital stay, clinicians still rely 
      on clinical scales to assess pain and stress burden. This study addresses the 
      relationship between stress and apneic spells in NICU patients to implement an 
      automatic stress detector. EEG, ECG and SpO(2) were recorded from 40 patients for at 
      least 3 hours and the stress burden was assessed using the Leuven Pain Scale. 
      Different logistic regression models were designed to detect the presence or the 
      absence of stress based on the signals reactivity to each apneic spell. The 
      classification shows that stress can be detected with an area under the curve of 
      0.94 and a misclassification error of 19.23%. These results were obtained via SpO(2) 
      dips and EEG regularity. These findings suggest that stress deepens the 
      physiological reaction to apneas, which could ultimately impact the neurological and 
      behavioral development.

AB  - The development of new technology such as wearables that record high-quality single 
      channel ECG, provides an opportunity for ECG screening in a larger population, 
      especially for atrial fibrillation screening. The main goal of this study is to 
      develop an automatic classification algorithm for normal sinus rhythm (NSR), atrial 
      fibrillation (AF), other rhythms (O), and noise from a single channel short ECG 
      segment (9-60 s). For this purpose, we combined a signal quality index (SQI) 
      algorithm, to assess noisy instances, and trained densely connected convolutional 
      neural networks to classify ECG recordings. Two convolutional neural network (CNN) 
      models (a main model that accepts 15 s ECG segments and a secondary model that 
      processes shorter 9 s segments) were trained using the training data set. If the 
      recording is determined to be of low quality by SQI, it is immediately classified as 
      noisy. Otherwise, it is transformed to a time-frequency representation and 
      classified with the CNN as NSR, AF, O, or noise. The results achieved on the 2017 
      PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology challenge test dataset were an overall F(1) score 
      of 0.82 (F(1) for NSR, AF, and O were 0.91, 0.83, and 0.72, respectively). Compared 
      with 80 challenge entries, this was the third best overall score achieved on the 
      evaluation dataset.

AB  - Recently, an electrically assisted bicycle has been widely used in daily life and 
      becomes very popular. The user selects the stepwise assist-mode to determine the 
      assistive torque for pleasurable running. From the viewpoint of improvement of 
      health by exercise, the electrically assisted bicycle can be an exercise machine 
      like a treadmill. The heart rate (HR) is regarded as an indication of exercise load. 
      This paper presents an automatic assist-mode selection system based on the HR of the 
      bicycle user. The HR is obtained from the R-waves measured by the proposed wearable 
      electrocardiograph on the user. The mode-selection system is simply implemented by a 
      personal computer, USB-connected interface, and some electronic switching circuits. 
      The running experiments confirm that the proposed assist-mode selection method has 
      practicability.

TI  - Heart rate dynamics distinguish among atrial fibrillation, normal sinus rhythm and 
      sinus rhythm with frequent ectopy.
PG  - 1873-88
LID - 10.1088/0967-3334/36/9/1873 [doi]
AB  - Atrial fibrillation (AF) is usually detected by inspection of the electrocardiogram 
      waveform, a task made difficult when the signal is distorted by noise. The RR 
      interval time series is more frequently available and accurate, yet linear and 
      nonlinear time series analyses that detect highly varying and irregular AF are 
      vulnerable to the common finding of frequent ectopy. We hypothesized that different 
      nonlinear measures might capture characteristic features of AF, normal sinus rhythm 
      (NSR), and sinus rhythm (SR) with frequent ectopy in ways that linear measures might 
      not. To test this, we studied 2722 patients with 24 h ECG recordings in the 
      University of Virginia Holter database. We found dynamical phenotypes for the three 
      rhythm classifications. As expected, AF records had the highest variability and 
      entropy, and NSR the lowest. SR with ectopy could be distinguished from AF, which 
      had higher entropy, and from NSR, which had different fractal scaling, measured as 
      higher detrended fluctuation analysis slope. With these dynamical phenotypes, we 
      developed successful classification strategies, and the nonlinear measures improved 
      on the use of mean and variability alone, even after adjusting for age. Final models 
      using all variables had excellent performance, with positive predictive values for 
      AF, NSR and SR with ectopy as high as 97, 98 and 90%, respectively. Since these 
      classifiers can reliably detect rhythm changes utilizing segments as short as 
      10 min, we envision their application in noisy settings and in personal monitoring 
      devices where only RR interval time series may be available.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine cardioprotective effects of Ρ-terminal fragment of adipokine 
      apelin-12 (A12), its novel structural analogue [MeArg(1), NLe(10)]-A12 (I), and 
      [d-Ala(12)]-A12 (II), a putative antagonist of APJ receptor, employing in vivo model 
      of ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Peptides were 
      synthesized by the automatic solid phase method using Fmoc technology. Anesthetized 
      open-chest male Wistar rats were subjected to left anterior descending (LAD) 
      coronary artery occlusion and coronary reperfusion. Hemodynamic variables and 
      electrocardiogram (ECG) were monitored throughout the experiment. Myocardial injury 
      was assessed by infarct size (IS), activity of necrosis markers in plasma, and 
      metabolic state of the area at risk (AAR). RESULTS: Intravenous injection of A12, I, 
      or II at the onset of reperfusion led to a transient reduction of the mean arterial 
      pressure. A12 or I administration decreased the percent ratio of IS/AAR by 40% and 
      30%, respectively, compared with control animals which received saline. Both 
      peptides improved preservation of high-energy phosphates, reduced lactate 
      accumulation in the AAR, and lowered CK-MB and LDH activities in plasma at the end 
      of reperfusion compared with these indices in control. Treatment with II did not 
      significantly affect either the IS/AAR, % ratio, or activities of both markers of 
      necrosis compared with control. The overall metabolic protection of the AAR in the 
      treated groups increased in the following rank: II < A12 < I. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      structural analogue of apelin-12 [MeArg(1), NLe(10)]-A12 may be a promising basis to 
      create a new drug for the treatment of acute coronary syndrome.

      complex of morphological criteria and algorithms].
PG  - 36-42
LID - 10.18087/cardio.2659 [doi]
AB  - AIM: The aim of study is a detection of ventricular and supraventricular wide QRS 
      arrhythmias using complex of morphological criteria and algorithms by method of 
      automatic analysis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: For 100 patients (m/f - 61/39, Me (min; 
      max) - 44.5 (10; 85) years) of researched group the analysis of 14306 single wide 
      ectopic complexes (QRS 120-230 ms) has been done. Wide complexes include 11028 (77%) 
      ventricular complexes and 3278 (23%) supraventricular complexes represented by 145 
      different forms of QRS. For verification of arrhythmias origin transesophageal ECG 
      recording and endocardial electrophysiological study were done. The control group 
      included 59 patients (m/f - 25/34, Me (min; max) - 49.5 (14,85) years) with 720 wide 
      QRS, including 467 (65%) ventricular and 253 (35%) supraventricular complexes 
      represented by 86 forms of QRS. The criteria Drew B.J., Scheinman M.M. (1995); 
      Wellens H.J. (1978), RWPT II (Pava LF, 2010) and the algorithms of Brugada P. 
      (1991); Bayesian (2000); Vereckei A. (2008) were used to evaluate sensitivity, 
      specificity and diagnostic accuracy of wide QRS complexes recognition one by one and 
      together, using the method of Wald sequential automatic analysis (KT Result3, CJSC 
      INCART, Russia) and method of artificial neural networks. RESULTS: The best results 
      for the detection of ventricular arrhythmias algorithms were demonstrated by the  
      Brugada  P., Drew  B.J., Scheinman  M.M. algorithm (sensitivity 86.43%, specificity 
      66.73%, diagnostic accuracy 82.14% in the study group, sensitivity 81.80%, 
      specificity 73.12%, diagnostic accuracy 78.75% in the control group), and the 
      Bayesian algorithm (sensitivity 87.81%, specificity 73.62%, diagnostic accuracy 
      84.72% in the study group, sensitivity 83.30%, specificity 77.08%, diagnostic 
      accuracy 81.11% in the control group). A complex analysis of the Wald method 
      recognized ventricular arrhythmias in the research group with sensitivity 83.11%, 
      specificity 83.65%, diagnostic accuracy 83.23% and in the control group with a 
      sensitivity 83.51%, specificity of 84.58% and diagnostic accuracy 83.89%. Artificial 
      neural networks recognized ventricular arrhythmias with sensitivity 91.43%, 
      specificity 91.30% and diagnostic accuracy 91.39% in the control group and with 
      sensitivity 97.06%, specificity 99.39% and diagnostic accuracy 97.6% in the research 
      group. CONCLUSION: Automatic analysis allows obtaining simultaneously the results of 
      each algorithms/criteria and in combination. It significantly reduces the doctor's 
      work in assessing of amplitude-time characteristics of the complexes. Using 
      artificial neural networks increases the accuracy of of ventricular and 
      supraventricular arrhythmias recognition.

TI  - An Obstructive Sleep Apnea Detection Approach Using a Discriminative Hidden Markov 
      Model From ECG Signals.
PG  - 1532-42
LID - 10.1109/TBME.2015.2498199 [doi]
AB  - Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) syndrome is a common sleep disorder suffered by an 
      increasing number of people worldwide. As an alternative to polysomnography (PSG) 
      for OSA diagnosis, the automatic OSA detection methods used in the current practice 
      mainly concentrate on feature extraction and classifier selection based on collected 
      physiological signals. However, one common limitation in these methods is that the 
      temporal dependence of signals are usually ignored, which may result in critical 
      information loss for OSA diagnosis. In this study, we propose a novel OSA detection 
      approach based on ECG signals by considering temporal dependence within segmented 
      signals. A discriminative hidden Markov model (HMM) and corresponding parameter 
      estimation algorithms are provided. In addition, subject-specific transition 
      probabilities within the model are employed to characterize the subject-to-subject 
      differences of potential OSA patients. To validate our approach, 70 recordings 
      obtained from the Physionet Apnea-ECG database were used. Accuracies of 97.1% for 
      per-recording classification and 86.2% for per-segment OSA detection with 
      satisfactory sensitivity and specificity were achieved. Compared with other existing 
      methods that simply ignore the temporal dependence of signals, the proposed 
      HMM-based detection approach delivers more satisfactory detection performance and 
      could be extended to other disease diagnosis applications.

TI  - Validation of a Novel Digital Tool in Automatic Scoring of an Online ECG Examination 
      at an International Cardiology Meeting.
PG  - 376-81
LID - 10.1111/anec.12311 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We have previously developed a novel digital tool capable of 
      automatically recognizing correct electrocardiography (ECG) diagnoses in an online 
      exam and demonstrated a significant improvement in diagnostic accuracy when 
      utilizing an inductive-deductive reasoning strategy over a pattern recognition 
      strategy. In this study, we sought to validate these findings from participants at 
      the International Winter Arrhythmia School meeting, one of the foremost 
      electrophysiology events in Canada. METHODS: Preregistration to the event was sent 
      by e-mail. The exam was administered on day 1 of the conference. Results and 
      analysis were presented the following morning to participants. RESULTS: Twenty-five 
      attendees completed the exam, providing a total of 500 responses to be marked. The 
      online tool accurately identified 195 of a total of 395 (49%) correct responses 
      (49%). In total, 305 responses required secondary manual review, of which 200 were 
      added to the correct responses pool. The overall accuracy of correct ECG diagnosis 
      for all participants was 69% and 84% when using pattern recognition or 
      inductive-deductive strategies, respectively. CONCLUSION: Utilization of a novel 
      digital tool to evaluate ECG competency can be set up as a workshop at international 
      meetings or educational events. Results can be presented during the sessions to 
      ensure immediate feedback.

TI  - PocketECG: A New Noninvasive Method for Continuous and Real-Time ECG 
      Monitoring-Initial Results in Children and Adolescents.
PG  - 448-455

AB  - Long-term ECG is widely used in diagnosis and assessment of many cardiac symptoms 
      which may be caused by dangerous arrhythmias that sometimes can be difficult to 
      document. The PocketECG system is a new technological solution for a long-term, 
      noninvasive, continuous and real-time ECG monitoring that provides automatic 
      diagnosis of dysrhythmias. ECG data transmission occurs over a mobile network. The 
      goal of this study was to assess the reliability of long-term ECG recordings 
      acquired with the PocketECG system. One hundred and fifteen patients (43 girls and 
      72 boys) of an average age of 15.5 ± 2.5 years were examined at the Department of 
      Cardiology at the Children's Memorial Health Institute. Two simultaneous 24-h ECG 
      recordings were conducted: one with a Holter monitor and one with the PocketECG 
      system. A linear correlation was demonstrated between the two methods with regard to 
      the recorded QRS complexes [H = 1173.0 (-1946.40; 4838.50) + PocketECG*0.98 (0.94; 
      1.02)]. Mean diurnal heart rhythms were comparable (p > 0.05) despite the fact that 
      the slowest and the fastest rates were different. The rate of detection for 
      ventricular, supraventricular dysrhythmias and pauses in ventricular rhythm were 
      comparable in both methods. The PocketECG system for continuous and real-time ECG 
      recording is a reliable method for the assessment of heart rhythm and dysrhythmias 
      in children and adolescents.

TI  - Automatic Identification of the Repolarization Endpoint by Computing the Dominant 
      T-wave on a Reduced Number of Leads.
PG  - 43-50
LID - 10.2174/1874120701610010043 [doi]
AB  - Electrocardiographic (ECG) T-wave endpoint (Tend) identification suffers lack of 
      reliability due to the presence of noise and variability among leads. Tend 
      identification can be improved by using global repolarization waveforms obtained by 
      combining several leads. The dominant T-wave (DTW) is a global repolarization 
      waveform that proved to improve Tend identification when computed using the 15 (I to 
      III, aVr, aVl, aVf, V1 to V6, X, Y, Z) leads usually available in clinics, of which 
      only 8 (I, II, V1 to V6) are independent. The aim of the present study was to 
      evaluate if the 8 independent leads are sufficient to obtain a DTW which allows a 
      reliable Tend identification. To this aim Tend measures automatically identified 
      from 15-dependent-lead DTWs of 46 control healthy subjects (CHS) and 103 acute 
      myocardial infarction patients (AMIP) were compared with those obtained from 
      8-independent-lead DTWs. Results indicate that Tend distributions have not 
      statistically different median values (CHS: 340 ms vs. 340 ms, respectively; AMIP: 
      325 ms vs. 320 ms, respectively), besides being strongly correlated (CHS: ρ=0.97, 
      AMIP: 0.88; P<10(-27)). Thus, measuring Tend from the 15-dependent-lead DTWs is 
      statistically equivalent to measuring Tend from the 8-independent-lead DTWs. In 
      conclusion, for the clinical purpose of automatic Tend identification from DTW, the 
      8 independent leads can be used without a statistically significant loss of accuracy 
      but with a significant decrement of computational effort. The lead dependence of 7 
      out of 15 leads does not introduce a significant bias in the Tend determination from 
      15 dependent lead DTWs.

AB  - Cardiac physiology is unique in neonates and infants; there are several physiologic 
      changes that occur in the first weeks of life. Important changes can be captured on 
      the bedside monitor and provide vital data in a noninvasive way to providers. The 
      importance of diligent observation cannot be overstated. Bedside monitoring has 
      improved in the last decade, which has enhanced the ability to detect changes in 
      heart rates and rhythms. The purpose here is to review cardiac physiology, describe 
      those arrhythmias able to be observed on bedside monitors, and highlight heart rate 
      changes that can be early signs of sepsis.

TI  - Wavelet packet analysis of disease-altered recurrence dynamics in the long-term 
      spatiotemporal vectorcardiogram (VCG) signals.
PG  - 2595-8
LID - 10.1109/EMBC.2013.6610071 [doi]
AB  - Vectorcardiogram (VCG) signals contain a wealth of dynamic information pertinent to 
      space-time cardiac electrical activities. However, few, if any, previous 
      investigations have studied disease-altered nonlinear dynamics in the spatiotemporal 
      VCG signals. Most previous nonlinear dynamic methods considered the time-delay 
      reconstructed state space from a single ECG trace. This paper presents a novel 
      multiscale recurrence approach to not only explore VCG recurrence dynamics but also 
      resolve the issue of recurrence computation for the large-scale datasets. As opposed 
      to the traditional single-scale recurrence analysis, we characterize and quantify 
      the recurrence behaviours in multiple wavelet scales. In addition, wavelet dyadic 
      subsampling enables the large-scale recurrence analysis, but it is used to be highly 
      expensive for a long-term time series. The classification experiments show that 
      multiscale recurrence analysis detects the myocardial infarctions from 3-lead VCG 
      with an average sensitivity of 96.8% and specificity of 92.8%, which show superior 
      performance (i.e., 5.6% improvements) to the single-scale recurrence analysis.

TI  - Fully automated QRS area measurement for predicting response to cardiac 
      resynchronization therapy.
LID - S0022-0736(19)30343-7 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jelectrocard.2019.07.003 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is an established treatment in 
      patients with heart failure and conduction abnormalities. However, a significant 
      number of patients do not respond to CRT. Currently employed criteria for selection 
      of patients for this therapy (QRS duration and morphology) have several 
      shortcomings. QRS area was recently shown to provide superior association with CRT 
      response. However, its assessment was not fully automated and required the presence 
      of an expert. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to develop a fully automated method for 
      the assessment of vector-cardiographic (VCG) QRS area from electrocardiographic 
      (ECG) signals. METHODS: Pre-implantation ECG recordings (N = 864, 695 
      left-bundle-branch block, 589 men) in PDF files were converted to allow signal 
      processing. QRS complexes were found and clustered into morphological groups. 
      Signals were converted from 12‑lead ECG to 3‑lead VCG and an average QRS complex was 
      built. QRS area was computed from individual areas in the X, Y and Z leads. 
      Practical usability was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier plots and 5-year follow-up 
      data. RESULTS: The automatically calculated QRS area values were 123 ± 48 μV.s (mean 
      values and SD), while the manually determined QRS area values were 116 ± 51 ms; the 
      correlation coefficient between the two was r = 0.97. The automated and manual 
      methods showed the same ability to stratify the population (hazard ratios 2.09 vs 
      2.03, respectively). CONCLUSION: The presented approach allows the fully automatic 
      and objective assessment of QRS area values. SIGNIFICANCE: Until this study, 
      assessing QRS area values required an expert, which means both additional costs and 
      a risk of subjectivity. The presented approach eliminates these disadvantages and is 
      publicly available as part of free signal-processing software.

TI  - Preventive Use of Ascorbic Acid For Atrial Fibrillation After Coronary Artery Bypass 
      Graft Surgery.
PG  - E415-E417
LID - 10.1532/hsf.1938 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation is one of the most frequent complications and a 
      major risk of morbidity and mortality after cardiac surgery. Antioxidants such as 
      vitamin C are used for prevention of this arrhythmia. Different results of studies 
      have been reported, but most of them have shown efficiency of vitamin C in 
      prophylaxis of postoperative AF. We tried to examine this efficacy with larger 
      sample size. METHODS: Three hundred and fourteen on pump coronary artery bypass 
      graft surgery alone. Patients were divided into two groups: The intervention group 
      received vitamin C (N = 160) and the control group did not receive any (N = 154). 
      Intervention group was administered two grams of vitamin C intravenously (IV) 24 
      hours preoperatively, 500 mg every 12 hours IV for 48 hours in ICU, and 500 mg every 
      12 hours PO for 48 hours in ward. Continuous monitoring in ICU and three times a day 
      ECG was used for AF detection. The two groups were compared. RESULTS: The two groups 
      were matched in terms of age, sex, LA size, ejection fraction, functional class, and 
      TSH level. Of the patients, 244 were male. Mean age was 62 years (40-84 years) in 
      both groups. M/F ratio was four in both groups. Functional class and ejection 
      fraction were the same in both groups. There was no mean TSH level difference. AF 
      occurrence in vitamin C group was 7.6 % and in control group was 7.8 %. There was no 
      difference in ICU or hospital stay. CONCLUSIONS: Prophylactic use of vitamin C does 
      not further reduce postoperative atrial fibrillation in on pump CABG patients.

TI  - Automatic quality classification of entire electrocardiographic recordings obtained 
      with a novel patch type recorder.
PG  - 5639-42
LID - 10.1109/EMBC.2014.6944906 [doi]
AB  - Recently, new patch type electrocardiogram (ECG) recorders have reached the market. 
      These new devices possess a number of advantages compared to the traditional Holter 
      recorders. This forms the basis of questions related to benefits and drawbacks of 
      different ambulatory ECG recording techniques. One of the important questions is the 
      ability to obtain high clinical quality of the recordings during the entire 
      monitoring period. It is thus desirable to be able to obtain an automatic estimate 
      of the global quality of entire ECG recordings. The purpose of this pilot study is 
      therefore to design an algorithm for automatic classification of entire ECG 
      recordings into the groups "noisy" and "clean" recordings. This novel algorithm is 
      based on three features and a simple Bayes classifier. The algorithm was tested on 
      40 ECG recordings in a five-fold cross validation scheme and it obtained an average 
      accuracy of 90% on the test data.

AB  - An automatic method is presented for detecting myocardial ischemia, which can be 
      considered as the early symptom of acute coronary events. Myocardial ischemia 
      commonly manifests as ST- and T-wave changes on ECG signals. The methods in this 
      study are proposed to detect abnormal ECG beats using knowledge-based features and 
      classification methods. A novel classification method, sparse representation-based 
      classification (SRC), is involved to improve the performance of the existing 
      algorithms. A comparison was made between two classification methods, SRC and 
      support-vector machine (SVM), using rule-based vectors as input feature space. The 
      two methods are proposed with quantitative evaluation to validate their 
      performances. The results of SRC method encompassed with rule-based features 
      demonstrate higher sensitivity than that of SVM. However, the specificity and 
      precision are a trade-off. Moreover, SRC method is less dependent on the selection 
      of rule-based features and can achieve high performance using fewer features. The 
      overall performances of the two methods proposed in this study are better than the 
      previous methods.

TI  - Identifying Drug (Cocaine) Intake Events from Acute Physiological Response in the 
      Presence of Free-living Physical Activity.
PG  - 71-82
AB  - A variety of health and behavioral states can potentially be inferred from 
      physiological measurements that can now be collected in the natural free-living 
      environment. The major challenge, however, is to develop computational models for 
      automated detection of health events that can work reliably in the natural field 
      environment. In this paper, we develop a physiologically-informed model to 
      automatically detect drug (cocaine) use events in the free-living environment of 
      participants from their electrocardiogram (ECG) measurements. The key to reliably 
      detecting drug use events in the field is to incorporate the knowledge of autonomic 
      nervous system (ANS) behavior in the model development so as to decompose the 
      activation effect of cocaine from the natural recovery behavior of the 
      parasympathetic nervous system (after an episode of physical activity). We collect 
      89 days of data from 9 active drug users in two residential lab environments and 922 
      days of data from 42 active drug users in the field environment, for a total of 
      11,283 hours. We develop a model that tracks the natural recovery by the 
      parasympathetic nervous system and then estimates the dampening caused to the 
      recovery by the activation of the sympathetic nervous system due to cocaine. We 
      develop efficient methods to screen and clean the ECG time series data and extract 
      candidate windows to assess for potential drug use. We then apply our model on the 
      recovery segments from these windows. Our model achieves 100% true positive rate 
      while keeping the false positive rate to 0.87/day over (9+ hours/day of) lab data 
      and to 1.13/day over (11+ hours/day of) field data.

AB  - This paper describes a new method for automatic detection of obstructive sleep apnea 
      (OSA) based on artificial neural networks (ANN) using regular electrocardiogram 
      (ECG) recordings. ECG signals were pre-processed and segmented to extract the 
      P-waves; then three P-wave features were extracted: the P-wave duration (T ( p )), 
      the P-wave dispersion (P ( d )), and the time interval from the peak of the P-wave 
      to the R-wave (T ( pr )). Combinations of the three features were used as features 
      for classification using ANN. For each feature combination studied, 70% of the input 
      data was used for training the ANN, 15% for validating, and 15% for testing the 
      results. Perfect agreement between expert's scores and the ANN scores was achieved 
      when the ANN was applied on T ( p ), P ( d ), and T ( pr ) taken together, while 
      substantial agreements were achieved when applying the ANN on the feature 
      combinations T ( p ) and P ( d ), and T ( p ) and T ( pr ).

AB  - Real-time remote health monitoring systems are experiencing tremendous advancement 
      resulting from improvements in low power, reliable sensors; yet they are still 
      constrained to low-level interpretation. Automatic data analysis continues to be a 
      tedious task due to a lack of efficient, reliable platforms for data analysis. In 
      this paper, we present a system for monitoring patients remotely by emphasizing the 
      strength of Complex Event Processing (CEP) and Situation Awareness. In this 
      approach, the system makes decisions in a declarative way, which helps medical 
      experts to understand the situation in a more realistic manner. The primary 
      objective of this paper is to explicate the different components inside the system. 
      To verify the technical feasibility of each component, the proposed system is 
      implemented and tested using ECG data.

TI  - False Alarm Reduction in Self-Care by Personalized Automatic Detection of ECG 
      Electrode Cable Interchanges.
PG  - 9175673
LID - 10.1155/2020/9175673 [doi]
LID - 9175673
AB  - INTRODUCTION: False alarm reduction is an important challenge in self-care, whereas 
      one of the most important false alarm causes in the cardiology domain is electrodes 
      misplacements in ECG recordings, the main investigations to perform for early and 
      pervasive detection of cardiovascular diseases. In this context, we present and 
      assess a new method for electrode reversals identification for Mason-Likar based 3D 
      ECG recording systems which are especially convenient to use in self-care and allow 
      to achieve, as previously reported, high computerized ischemia detection accuracy. 
      METHODS: We mathematically simulate the effect of the six pairwise reversals of the 
      LA, RA, LL, and C2 electrodes on the three ECG leads I, II, and V2. Our approach 
      then consists in performing serial comparisons of the newly recorded 3D ECG and of 
      the six derived ECGs simulating an electrode reversal with a standard, 12-lead 
      reference ECG by means of the CAVIAR software. We further use a scoring method to 
      compare these analysis results and then apply a decision tree model to extract the 
      most relevant measurements in a learning set of 121 patients recorded in ICU. 
      RESULTS: The comparison of the seven sets of serial analysis results from the 
      learning set resulted in the determination of a composite criteria involving four 
      measurements of spatial orientation changes of QRS and T and providing a reversal 
      identification accuracy of 100%. Almost the same results, with 99.99% of sensitivity 
      and 100% of specificity, were obtained in two test sets from 90 patients, composed 
      of 2098 and 2036 representative ECG beats respectively recorded during PTCA balloon 
      inflation, a procedure which mimics ischemia, and before PTCA for control. 
      CONCLUSION: Personalized automatic detection of ECG electrode cable interchanges can 
      reach almost the maximal accuracy of 100% in self-care, and can be performed in 
      almost real time.

AB  - Digital electrocardiographs are now widely available and a large number of digital 
      electrocardiograms (ECGs) have been recorded and stored. The present study describes 
      the development and clinical applications of a large database of such digital ECGs, 
      namely the CODE (Clinical Outcomes in Digital Electrocardiology) study. ECGs 
      obtained by the Telehealth Network of Minas Gerais, Brazil, from 2010 to 17, were 
      organized in a structured database. A hierarchical free-text machine learning 
      algorithm recognized specific ECG diagnoses from cardiologist reports. The Glasgow 
      ECG Analysis Program provided Minnesota Codes and automatic diagnostic statements. 
      The presence of a specific ECG abnormality was considered when both automatic and 
      medical diagnosis were concordant; cases of discordance were decided using 
      heuristisc rules and manual review. The ECG database was linked to the national 
      mortality information system using probabilistic linkage methods. From 2,470,424 
      ECGs, 1,773,689 patients were identified. After excluding the ECGs with technical 
      problems and patients <16 years-old, 1,558,415 patients were studied. High 
      performance measures were obtained using an end-to-end deep neural network trained 
      to detect 6 types of ECG abnormalities, with F1 scores >80% and specificity >99% in 
      an independent test dataset. We also evaluated the risk of mortality associated with 
      the presence of atrial fibrillation (AF), which showed that AF was a strong 
      predictor of cardiovascular mortality and mortality for all causes, with increased 
      risk in women. In conclusion, a large database that comprises all ECGs performed by 
      a large telehealth network can be useful for further developments in the field of 
      digital electrocardiography, clinical cardiology and cardiovascular epidemiology.

AB  - Central venous pressure (CVP) is an important clinical parameter for physicians but 
      only the absolute CVP value is typically monitored in the intensive care unit (ICU). 
      In this study, we propose a novel mathematical method to present and analyze CVP 
      signals. A total of 44 suitable samples were chosen from a total of 65 collected in 
      an ICU. Pre-processing of the samples included rate reduction and digital filtering. 
      The statistical features of time and frequency domain, wavelet, and empirical mode 
      decomposition of these signals were extracted. We found no significant difference 
      among the CVP signals regarding sex, smoking, coronary disease, and respiration mode 
      of the samples.

AB  - The understanding of heart rate variability (HRV) has increased parallel with the 
      development of modern physiology. Discovered probably first in 1847 by Ludwig, 
      clinical applications evolved in the second part of the twentieth century. Today HRV 
      is mostly used in cardiology and research settings. In general, HRV can be measured 
      over shorter (e.g., 5-10 min) or longer (12 or 24 h) periods. Since 1996, most 
      measurements and calculations are made according to the standard of the Task Force 
      of the European Society of Cardiology and the North American Society of Pacing and 
      Electrophysiology. As the first step, the series of times between successive R-peaks 
      in the ECG are in milliseconds. It is crucial, however, to identify and remove 
      extrasystoles and artifacts according to standard protocols. The series of QRS 
      distances between successive heartbeats can be analyzed with simple or more 
      sophisticated algorithms, beginning with standard deviation (SDNN) or by the square 
      root of the mean of the sum of squares of differences between adjacent normal RR 
      (rMSSD). Short-term HRV is frequently analyzed with the help of a non-parametric 
      fast Fourier transformation quantifying the different frequency bands during the 
      measurement period. In the last decades, various non-linear algorithms have been 
      presented, such as different entropy and fractal measures or wavelet analysis. 
      Although most of them have a strong theoretical foundation, their clinical relevance 
      is still debated.

TI  - Noise-aware dictionary-learning-based sparse representation framework for detection 
      and removal of single and combined noises from ECG signal.
PG  - 2-12
LID - 10.1049/htl.2016.0077 [doi]
AB  - Automatic electrocardiogram (ECG) signal enhancement has become a crucial 
      pre-processing step in most ECG signal analysis applications. In this Letter, the 
      authors propose an automated noise-aware dictionary learning-based generalised ECG 
      signal enhancement framework which can automatically learn the dictionaries based on 
      the ECG noise type for effective representation of ECG signal and noises, and can 
      reduce the computational load of sparse representation-based ECG enhancement system. 
      The proposed framework consists of noise detection and identification, noise-aware 
      dictionary learning, sparse signal decomposition and reconstruction. The noise 
      detection and identification is performed based on the moving average filter, 
      first-order difference, and temporal features such as number of turning points, 
      maximum absolute amplitude, zerocrossings, and autocorrelation features. The 
      representation dictionary is learned based on the type of noise identified in the 
      previous stage. The proposed framework is evaluated using noise-free and noisy ECG 
      signals. Results demonstrate that the proposed method can significantly reduce 
      computational load as compared with conventional dictionary learning-based ECG 
      denoising approaches. Further, comparative results show that the method outperforms 
      existing methods in automatically removing noises such as baseline wanders, 
      power-line interference, muscle artefacts and their combinations without distorting 
      the morphological content of local waves of ECG signal.

TI  - A 410-nW Efficient QRS Processor for Mobile ECG Monitoring in 0.18-μm CMOS.
PG  - 1356-1365
LID - 10.1109/TBCAS.2017.2731797 [doi]
AB  - This paper proposes a low power and efficient QRS processor for real-time and 
      continuous mobile ECG monitoring. The QRS detector contains the wavelet transform 
      (WT), the modulus maxima pair identification (MMPI), and the R position modification 
      (RPM). In order to reduce power consumption, we choose the Haar function as the 
      mother wavelet of WT. It is implemented by an optimized FIR filter structure where 
      none of the multiplier is used. The MMPI processes the wavelet coefficients at scale 
      2(4) and provides candidate R peak positions for the RPM. To improve the accuracy 
      and robust performance, a number of modules have been designed in MMPI, including 
      the preprocessing unit, the automatic threshold updating, and the decision state 
      machine. The RPM is designed to eliminate digital time delay in wavelet transform 
      and locate the R peak position precisely. Raw ECG signals and QRS detection results 
      are output simultaneously. Fabricated in 0.18-μm N-well CMOS 1P6M technology, the 
      power consumption of this chip is only about 410 nW in 1 V voltage supply. Validated 
      by all 48 sets of data in the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database, the sensitive and the 
      positive prediction are 99.60% and 99.77% respectively.

TI  - Heartbeat Classification Using Abstract Features From the Abductive Interpretation 
      of the ECG.
PG  - 409-420
LID - 10.1109/JBHI.2016.2631247 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This paper aims to prove that automatic beat classification on ECG 
      signals can be effectively solved with a pure knowledge-based approach, using an 
      appropriate set of abstract features obtained from the interpretation of the 
      physiological processes underlying the signal. METHODS: A set of qualitative 
      morphological and rhythm features are obtained for each heartbeat as a result of the 
      abductive interpretation of the ECG. Then, a QRS clustering algorithm is applied in 
      order to reduce the effect of possible errors in the interpretation. Finally, a 
      rule-based classifier assigns a tag to each cluster. RESULTS: The method has been 
      tested with the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database records, showing a significantly better 
      performance than any other automatic approach in the state-of-the-art, and even 
      improving most of the assisted approaches that require the intervention of an expert 
      in the process. CONCLUSION: The most relevant issues in ECG classification, related 
      to a large extent to the variability of the signal patterns between different 
      subjects and even in the same subject over time, will be overcome by changing the 
      reasoning paradigm. SIGNIFICANCE: This paper demonstrates the power of an abductive 
      framework for time-series interpretation to make a qualitative leap in the 
      significance of the information extracted from the ECG by automatic methods.

TI  - A new method for QRS detection in ECG signals using QRS-preserving filtering 
      techniques.
PG  - 207-217
LID - 10.1515/bmt-2016-0072 [doi]
AB  - Detection of QRS complexes in ECG signals is required for various purposes such as 
      determination of heart rate, feature extraction and classification. The problem of 
      automatic QRS detection in ECG signals is complicated by the presence of noise 
      spectrally overlapping with the QRS frequency range. As a solution to this problem, 
      we propose the use of least-squares-optimisation-based smoothing techniques that 
      suppress the noise peaks in the ECG while preserving the QRS complexes. We also 
      propose a novel nonlinear transformation technique that is applied after the 
      smoothing operations, which equalises the QRS amplitudes without boosting the 
      supressed noise peaks. After these preprocessing operations, the R-peaks can finally 
      be detected with high accuracy. The proposed technique has a low computational load 
      and, therefore, it can be used for real-time QRS detection in a wearable device such 
      as a Holter monitor or for fast offline QRS detection. The offline and real-time 
      versions of the proposed technique have been evaluated on the standard MIT-BIH 
      database. The offline implementation is found to perform better than 
      state-of-the-art techniques based on wavelet transforms, empirical mode 
      decomposition, etc. and the real-time implementation also shows improved performance 
      over existing real-time QRS detection techniques.

TI  - MRI in the neonatal ICU: initial experience using a small-footprint 1.5-T system.
PG  - W95-W105
LID - 10.2214/AJR.13.10613 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to develop a small 1.5-T MRI system for 
      neonatal imaging that can be installed in the neonatal ICU (NICU) and to evaluate 
      its performance in 15 neonates. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A 1.5-T MR system designed for 
      orthopedic use was adapted for neonatal imaging. Modifications included raising and 
      leveling the magnet, construction of a patient table, and integration of imaging 
      electronics from a high-performance adult-sized scanner. The system was used to 
      perform MR examinations of the brain, abdomen, and chest in 15 medically stable 
      neonates using standard clinical protocols. The scanning time was limited to 60 
      minutes. The MR examinations were performed without administering sedation to the 
      patients. ECG, heart rate, oxygen saturation, and temperature were monitored 
      continuously throughout the examination. The images were evaluated by two pediatric 
      radiologists for overall study quality, motion artifact, spatial resolution, 
      signal-to-noise ratio, and contrast. RESULTS: All 15 neonates were successfully 
      imaged without sedation. No adverse MRI-related events were noted. In total, 19 
      brain and seven abdominal examinations were performed. Six chest and two cardiac 
      examinations were also obtained. Gross (versus physiologic) subject motion proved to 
      be the most influential factor in determining overall study and image quality. 
      High-quality diagnostic images were obtained at each anatomic location. CONCLUSION: 
      The customized neonatal MRI system provides state-of-the-art MRI capabilities in the 
      NICU.

TI  - Automatic Detection of Target Engagement in Transcutaneous Cervical Vagal Nerve 
      Stimulation for Traumatic Stress Triggers.
LID - 10.1109/JBHI.2020.2981116 [doi]
AB  - Transcutaneous cervical vagal nerve stimulation (tcVNS) devices are attractive 
      alternatives to surgical implants, and can be applied for a number of conditions in 
      ambulatory settings, including stress-related neuropsychiatric disorders. 
      Transferring tcVNS technologies to at-home settings brings challenges associated 
      with the assessment of therapy response. The ability to accurately detect whether 
      tcVNS has been effectively delivered in a remote setting such as the home has never 
      been investigated. We designed and conducted a study in which 12 human subjects 
      received active tcVNS and 14 received sham stimulation in tandem with traumatic 
      stress, and measured continuous cardiopulmonary signals including the 
      electrocardiogram (ECG), photoplethysmogram (PPG), seismocardiogram (SCG), and 
      respiratory effort (RSP). We extracted physiological parameters related to autonomic 
      nervous system activity, and created a feature set from these parameters to: 1) 
      detect active (vs. sham) tcVNS stimulation presence with machine learning methods, 
      and 2) determine which sensing modalities and features provide the most salient 
      markers of tcVNS-based changes in physiological signals. Heart rate (ECG), vasomotor 
      activity (PPG), and pulse arrival time (ECG+PPG) provided sufficient information to 
      determine target engagement (compared to sham) in addition to other combinations of 
      sensors. resulting in 96% accuracy, precision, and recall with a receiver operator 
      characteristics area of 0.96. Two commonly utilized sensing modalities (ECG and PPG) 
      that are suitable for home use can provide useful information on therapy response 
      for tcVNS. The methods presented herein could be deployed in wearable devices to 
      quantify adherence for at-home use of tcVNS technologies.

TI  - Safe automatic one-lead electrocardiogram analysis in screening for atrial 
      fibrillation.
PG  - 1449-1453
LID - 10.1093/europace/euw286 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Screening for atrial fibrillation (AF) using intermittent electrocardiogram 
      (ECG) recordings can identify individuals at risk of AF-related morbidity in 
      particular stroke. We aimed to validate the performance of an AF screening algorithm 
      compared with manual ECG analysis by specially trained nurses and physicians (gold 
      standard) in 30 s intermittent one-lead ECG recordings. METHODS AND RESULTS: The 
      STROKESTOP study is a mass-screening study for AF using intermittent ECG recordings. 
      All individuals in the study without known AF registered a 30-s ECG recording in 
      Lead I two times daily for 2 weeks, and all ECGs were manually interpreted. A 
      computerized algorithm was used to analyse 80 149 ECG recordings in 3209 
      individuals. The computerized algorithm annotated 87.1% (n = 69 789) of the 
      recordings as sinus rhythm/minor rhythm disturbances. The manual interpretation 
      (gold standard) was that 69 758 ECGs were normal, making the negative predictive 
      value of the algorithm 99.9%. The number of ECGs requiring manual interpretation in 
      order to find one pathological ECG was reduced from 288 to 35. Atrial fibrillation 
      was diagnosed in 84 patients by manual interpretation, in all of whom the algorithm 
      indicated pathology. On an ECG level, 278 ECGs were manually interpreted as AF, and 
      of these the algorithm annotated 272 ECGs as pathological (sensitivity 97.8%). 
      CONCLUSION: Automatic ECG screening using a computerized algorithm safely identifies 
      normal ECGs in Lead I and reduces the need for manual evaluation of individual ECGs 
      with >85% with 100% sensitivity on an individual basis.

TI  - A Prototype Framework Design for Assisting the Detection of Atrial Fibrillation 
      Using a Generic Low-Cost Biomedical Sensor.

AB  - Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death around the world. As a 
      result, low-cost biomedical sensors have been gaining importance in business and 
      research over the last few decades. Their main benefits include their small size, 
      light weight, portability and low power consumption. Despite these advantages, they 
      are not generally used for clinical monitoring mainly because of their low accuracy 
      in data acquisition. In this emerging technological context, this paper contributes 
      by discussing a methodology to help practitioners build a prototype framework based 
      on a low-cost commercial sensor. The resulting application consists of four modules; 
      namely, a digitalization module whose input is an electrocardiograph signal in 
      portable document format (PDF) or joint photographic expert group format (JPEG), a 
      module to further process and filter the digitalized signal, a selectable data 
      calibration module and, finally, a module implementing a classification algorithm to 
      distinguish between individuals with normal sinus rhythms and those with atrial 
      fibrillation. This last module employs our recently published symbolic recurrence 
      quantification analysis (SRQA) algorithm on a time series of RR intervals. Moreover, 
      we show that the algorithm applies to any biomedical low-cost sensor, achieving good 
      results without requiring.

TI  - Sleep stage and obstructive apneaic epoch classification using single-lead ECG.
PG  - 39
LID - 10.1186/1475-925X-9-39 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Polysomnography (PSG) is used to define physiological sleep and 
      different physiological sleep stages, to assess sleep quality and diagnose many 
      types of sleep disorders such as obstructive sleep apnea. However, PSG requires not 
      only the connection of various sensors and electrodes to the subject but also 
      spending the night in a bed that is different from the subject's own bed. This study 
      is designed to investigate the feasibility of automatic classification of sleep 
      stages and obstructive apneaic epochs using only the features derived from a 
      single-lead electrocardiography (ECG) signal. METHODS: For this purpose, PSG 
      recordings (ECG included) were obtained during the night's sleep (mean duration 7 
      hours) of 17 subjects (5 men) with ages between 26 and 67. Based on these 
      recordings, sleep experts performed sleep scoring for each subject. This study 
      consisted of the following steps: (1) Visual inspection of ECG data corresponding to 
      each 30-second epoch, and selection of epochs with relatively clean signals, (2) 
      beat-to-beat interval (RR interval) computation using an R-peak detection algorithm, 
      (3) feature extraction from RR interval values, and (4) classification of sleep 
      stages (or obstructive apneaic periods) using one-versus-rest approach. The features 
      used in the study were the median value, the difference between the 75 and 25 
      percentile values, and mean absolute deviations of the RR intervals computed for 
      each epoch. The k-nearest-neighbor (kNN), quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA), and 
      support vector machines (SVM) methods were used as the classification tools. In the 
      testing procedure 10-fold cross-validation was employed. RESULTS: QDA and SVM 
      performed similarly well and significantly better than kNN for both sleep stage and 
      apneaic epoch classification studies. The classification accuracy rates were between 
      80 and 90% for the stages other than non-rapid-eye-movement stage 2. The accuracies 
      were 60 or 70% for that specific stage. In five obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) 
      patients, the accurate apneaic epoch detection rates were over 89% for QDA and SVM. 
      CONCLUSION: This study, in general, showed that RR-interval based classification, 
      which requires only single-lead ECG, is feasible for sleep stage and apneaic epoch 
      determination and can pave the road for a simple automatic classification system 
      suitable for home-use.

AB  - PURPOSE: Previous studies have shown that heart rate complexity may be a useful 
      indicator of patient status in the critical care environment but will require 
      continuous, accurate, and automated R-wave detection (RWD) in the electrocardiogram 
      (ECG). Although numerous RWD algorithms exist, accurate detection remains a 
      challenge. The purpose of this study was to develop and validate a novel fusion 
      algorithm (Automated Electrocardiogram Selection of Peaks, or AESOP) that combines 
      the strengths of several well-known algorithms to provide a more reliable real-time 
      solution to the RWD problem. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study involved the ECGs of 
      108 prehospital patient records and 32 ECGs from a conscious sedated porcine model 
      of hemorrhagic shock. The criterion standard for validation was manual verification 
      of R waves. RESULTS: For 108 human ECG records, the AESOP algorithm overall 
      outperformed each of its component algorithms. In addition, for 32 swine ECG 
      records, AESOP achieved an R-wave sensitivity of 97.9% and a positive predictive 
      value of 97.5%, again outperforming its component algorithms. CONCLUSION: By fusing 
      several best algorithms, AESOP uses the strengths of each algorithm to perform more 
      robustly and reliably in real time. The AESOP algorithm will be integrated into a 
      real-time heart rate complexity software program for decision support and triage in 
      critically ill patients.

TI  - Analysis of Pulse Arrival Time as an Indicator of Blood Pressure in a Large Surgical 
      Biosignal Database: Recommendations for Developing Ubiquitous Blood Pressure 
      Monitoring Methods.
LID - 10.3390/jcm8111773 [doi]
LID - 1773
AB  - As non-invasive continuous blood pressure monitoring (NCBPM) has gained wide 
      attraction in the recent decades, many pulse arrival time (PAT) or pulse transit 
      time (PTT) based blood pressure (BP) estimation studies have been conducted. 
      However, most of the studies have used small homogeneous subject pools to generate 
      models of BP based on particular interventions for induced hemodynamic change. In 
      this study, a large open biosignal database from a diverse group of 2309 surgical 
      patients was analyzed to assess the efficacy of PAT, PTT, and confounding factors on 
      the estimation of BP. After pre-processing the dataset, a total of 6,777,308 data 
      pairs of BP and temporal features between electrocardiogram (ECG) and 
      photoplethysmogram (PPG) were extracted and analyzed. Correlation analysis revealed 
      that PAT or PTT extracted from the intersecting-tangent (IT) point of PPG showed the 
      highest mean correlation to BP. The mean correlation between PAT and systolic blood 
      pressure (SBP) was -0.37 and the mean correlation between PAT and diastolic blood 
      pressure (DBP) was -0.30, outperforming the correlation between BP and PTT at -0.12 
      for SBP and -0.11 for DBP. A linear model of BP with a simple calibration method 
      using PAT as a predictor was developed which satisfied international standards for 
      automatic oscillometric BP monitors in the case of DBP, however, SBP could not be 
      predicted to a satisfactory level due to higher errors. Furthermore, multivariate 
      regression analyses showed that many confounding factors considered in previous 
      studies had inconsistent effects on the degree of correlation between PAT and BP.

AB  - In this study, heartbeat time series are classified using support vector machines 
      (SVMs). Statistical methods and signal analysis techniques are used to extract 
      features from the signals. The SVM classifier is favorably compared to other neural 
      network-based classification approaches by performing leave-one-out cross 
      validation. The performance of the SVM with respect to other state-of-the-art 
      classifiers is also confirmed by the classification of signals presenting very low 
      signal-to-noise ratio. Finally, the influence of the number of features to the 
      classification rate was also investigated for two real datasets. The first dataset 
      consists of long-term ECG recordings of young and elderly healthy subjects. The 
      second dataset consists of long-term ECG recordings of normal subjects and subjects 
      suffering from coronary artery disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In simultaneous EEG-fMRI, identification of the period of 
      cardioballistic artifact (BCG) in EEG is required for the artifact removal. 
      Recording the electrocardiogram (ECG) waveform during fMRI is difficult, often 
      causing inaccurate period detection. NEW METHOD: Since the waveform of the BCG 
      extracted by independent component analysis (ICA) is relatively invariable compared 
      to the ECG waveform, we propose a multiple-scale peak-detection algorithm to 
      determine the BCG cycle directly from the EEG data. The algorithm first extracts the 
      high contrast BCG component from the EEG data by ICA. The BCG cycle is then 
      estimated by band-pass filtering the component around the fundamental frequency 
      identified from its energy spectral density, and the peak of BCG artifact occurrence 
      is selected from each of the estimated cycle. RESULTS: The algorithm is shown to 
      achieve a high accuracy on a large EEG-fMRI dataset. It is also adaptive to various 
      heart rates without the needs of adjusting the threshold parameters. The cycle 
      detection remains accurate with the scan duration reduced to half a minute. 
      Additionally, the algorithm gives a figure of merit to evaluate the reliability of 
      the detection accuracy. COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHOD: The algorithm is shown to 
      give a higher detection accuracy than the commonly used cycle detection algorithm 
      fmrib_qrsdetect implemented in EEGLAB. CONCLUSIONS: The achieved high cycle 
      detection accuracy of our algorithm without using the ECG waveforms makes possible 
      to create and automate pipelines for processing large EEG-fMRI datasets, and 
      virtually eliminates the need for ECG recordings for BCG artifact removal.

TI  - ECG-based gating in ultra high field cardiovascular magnetic resonance using an 
      independent component analysis approach.
PG  - 104
LID - 10.1186/1532-429X-15-104 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance (CMR), the synchronization of image 
      acquisition with heart motion is performed in clinical practice by processing the 
      electrocardiogram (ECG). The ECG-based synchronization is well established for MR 
      scanners with magnetic fields up to 3 T. However, this technique is prone to errors 
      in ultra high field environments, e.g. in 7 T MR scanners as used in research 
      applications. The high magnetic fields cause severe magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) 
      effects which disturb the ECG signal. Image synchronization is thus less reliable 
      and yields artefacts in CMR images. METHODS: A strategy based on Independent 
      Component Analysis (ICA) was pursued in this work to enhance the ECG contribution 
      and attenuate the MHD effect. ICA was applied to 12-lead ECG signals recorded inside 
      a 7 T MR scanner. An automatic source identification procedure was proposed to 
      identify an independent component (IC) dominated by the ECG signal. The identified 
      IC was then used for detecting the R-peaks. The presented ICA-based method was 
      compared to other R-peak detection methods using 1) the raw ECG signal, 2) the raw 
      vectorcardiogram (VCG), 3) the state-of-the-art gating technique based on the VCG, 
      4) an updated version of the VCG-based approach and 5) the ICA of the VCG. RESULTS: 
      ECG signals from eight volunteers were recorded inside the MR scanner. Recordings 
      with an overall length of 87 min accounting for 5457 QRS complexes were available 
      for the analysis. The records were divided into a training and a test dataset. In 
      terms of R-peak detection within the test dataset, the proposed ICA-based algorithm 
      achieved a detection performance with an average sensitivity (Se) of 99.2%, a 
      positive predictive value (+P) of 99.1%, with an average trigger delay and jitter of 
      5.8 ms and 5.0 ms, respectively. Long term stability of the demixing matrix was 
      shown based on two measurements of the same subject, each being separated by one 
      year, whereas an averaged detection performance of Se = 99.4% and +P = 99.7% was 
      achieved.Compared to the state-of-the-art VCG-based gating technique at 7 T, the 
      proposed method increased the sensitivity and positive predictive value within the 
      test dataset by 27.1% and 42.7%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The presented ICA-based 
      method allows the estimation and identification of an IC dominated by the ECG 
      signal. R-peak detection based on this IC outperforms the state-of-the-art VCG-based 
      technique in a 7 T MR scanner environment.

TI  - Automatic classification of long-term ambulatory ECG records according to type of 
      ischemic heart disease.
PG  - 107
LID - 10.1186/1475-925X-10-107 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Elevated transient ischemic ST segment episodes in the ambulatory 
      electrocardiographic (AECG) records appear generally in patients with transmural 
      ischemia (e. g. Prinzmetal's angina) while depressed ischemic episodes appear in 
      patients with subendocardial ischemia (e. g. unstable or stable angina). Huge amount 
      of AECG data necessitates automatic methods for analysis. We present an algorithm 
      which determines type of transient ischemic episodes in the leads of records 
      (elevations/depressions) and classifies AECG records according to type of ischemic 
      heart disease (Prinzmetal's angina; coronary artery diseases excluding patients with 
      Prinzmetal's angina; other heart diseases). METHODS: The algorithm was developed 
      using 24-hour AECG records of the Long Term ST Database (LTST DB). The algorithm 
      robustly generates ST segment level function in each AECG lead of the records, and 
      tracks time varying non-ischemic ST segment changes such as slow drifts and axis 
      shifts to construct the ST segment reference function. The ST segment reference 
      function is then subtracted from the ST segment level function to obtain the ST 
      segment deviation function. Using the third statistical moment of the histogram of 
      the ST segment deviation function, the algorithm determines deflections of leads 
      according to type of ischemic episodes present (elevations, depressions), and then 
      classifies records according to type of ischemic heart disease. RESULTS: Using 74 
      records of the LTST DB (containing elevated or depressed ischemic episodes, mixed 
      ischemic episodes, or no episodes), the algorithm correctly determined deflections 
      of the majority of the leads of the records and correctly classified majority of the 
      records with Prinzmetal's angina into the Prinzmetal's angina category (7 out of 8); 
      majority of the records with other coronary artery diseases into the coronary artery 
      diseases excluding patients with Prinzmetal's angina category (47 out of 55); and 
      correctly classified one out of 11 records with other heart diseases into the other 
      heart diseases category. CONCLUSIONS: The developed algorithm is suitable for 
      processing long AECG data, efficient, and correctly classified the majority of 
      records of the LTST DB according to type of transient ischemic heart disease.

TI  - Intrinsic mode analysis of human heartbeat time series.
PG  - 1337-44
LID - 10.1007/s10439-010-9939-z [doi]
AB  - The human heartbeat interval is determined by complex nerve control and 
      environmental inputs. As a result, the heartbeat interval for a human is a complex 
      time series, as shown by previous studies. Most of the analysis algorithms proposed 
      for characterizing the profile of heartbeat time series, such as detrended 
      fluctuation analysis and multi-scale entropy, are based on various characteristics 
      of dynamics. In this study, we present an empirical mode decomposition-based 
      intrinsic mode analysis, which uses the appearance energy index (AEI) to quantify 
      the property of long-term correlation, and structure index (SI) to characterize the 
      internal modulation of data. This presented algorithm was used to investigate the 
      human heartbeat time series downloaded from PhysioBank. We found the profiles of 
      human heartbeat time series of subjects with congestive heart failure (CHF) or 
      atrial fibrillation (AF) are significantly different from those of healthy subjects 
      in internal modulation as shown by SI. Moreover, AEI is the critical characteristics 
      for verifying subjects with CHF from subjects with AF in a degree of long-term 
      correlation. Both AEI and SI contribute to presenting the characteristic profiles of 
      a human heartbeat time series.

TI  - Inconsistent shock advisories for monomorphic VT and Torsade de Pointes--A 
      prospective experimental study on AEDs and defibrillators.

LID - S0300-9572(15)00083-0 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.resuscitation.2015.02.016 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease and sudden cardiac arrest are the leading causes 
      of death in the United States. Early defibrillation is key to successful 
      resuscitation for patients who experience shockable rhythms during a cardiac arrest. 
      It is therefore vital that the shock advisory of AEDs (automated external 
      defibrillators) or defibrillators in AED mode be reliable and appropriate. The goal 
      of this study was to better understand the performance of multiple lay-rescuer and 
      hospital professional defibrillators in AED mode in their analysis of ventricular 
      arrhythmias. The measurable objectives of this study sought to quantify: 1. No shock 
      advisory for sinus rhythms at any rate. 2. Recognition and shock advisory for 
      ventricular fibrillation (VF). 3. Recognition and shock advisory for monomorphic 
      ventricular tachycardia (VT). 4. Recognition and shock advisory for Torsades de 
      Pointes (TdP). METHODS: This is a prospective evaluation of two AEDs and four 
      semi-automatic, hospital professional defibrillators. This study represents 
      post-marketing evaluation of FDA approved devices. Each defibrillator was connected 
      to multiple rhythm simulators and presented with simulated ECG waveforms 20 
      consecutive times at various rates when possible. RESULTS: All four defibrillators 
      and both AEDs tested consistently recognized normal sinus rhythm (NSR) from all 
      rhythm sources, and did not recommend a shock for NSR at any rate (from 80 to 220 
      bpm). All four defibrillators and both AEDs recognized VF from all rhythm sources 
      tested and recommended a shock 100% of the time. Variations were found in the shock 
      advisory rates among defibrillators when testing simulated VT heart rates at or 
      below 150 bpm. One AED tested did not consistently advise a shock for monomorphic VT 
      or TdP at any tested rate. CONCLUSION: Lay-rescuer AEDs and professional hospital 
      defibrillators tested in AED mode did not reliably recommend a shock for sustained 
      monomorphic VT or TdP at certain rates, despite the fact that it is a critical 
      component of the currently recommended treatment. These findings require further 
      examination of the risk benefit analysis of shocking or not shocking rhythms such as 
      TdP or pulseless VT.

TI  - Complexity quantification of cardiac variability time series using improved sample 
      entropy (I-SampEn).
PG  - 755-63
LID - 10.1007/s13246-016-0457-7 [doi]
AB  - The sample entropy (SampEn) has been widely used to quantify the complexity of 
      RR-interval time series. It is a fact that higher complexity, and hence, entropy is 
      associated with the RR-interval time series of healthy subjects. But, SampEn suffers 
      from the disadvantage that it assigns higher entropy to the randomized surrogate 
      time series as well as to certain pathological time series, which is a misleading 
      observation. This wrong estimation of the complexity of a time series may be due to 
      the fact that the existing SampEn technique updates the threshold value as a 
      function of long-term standard deviation (SD) of a time series. However, time series 
      of certain pathologies exhibits substantial variability in beat-to-beat 
      fluctuations. So the SD of the first order difference (short term SD) of the time 
      series should be considered while updating threshold value, to account for 
      period-to-period variations inherited in a time series. In the present work, 
      improved sample entropy (I-SampEn), a new methodology has been proposed in which 
      threshold value is updated by considering the period-to-period variations of a time 
      series. The I-SampEn technique results in assigning higher entropy value to 
      age-matched healthy subjects than patients suffering atrial fibrillation (AF) and 
      diabetes mellitus (DM). Our results are in agreement with the theory of reduction in 
      complexity of RR-interval time series in patients suffering from chronic 
      cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular diseases.

TI  - Adaptive Sampling of the Electrocardiogram Based on Generalized Perceptual Features.
LID - 10.3390/s20020373 [doi]
LID - 373
AB  - A non-uniform distribution of diagnostic information in the electrocardiogram (ECG) 
      has been commonly accepted and is the background to several compression, denoising 
      and watermarking methods. Gaze tracking is a widely recognized method for 
      identification of an observer's preferences and interest areas. The statistics of 
      experts' scanpaths were found to be a convenient quantitative estimate of medical 
      information density for each particular component (i.e., wave) of the ECG record. In 
      this paper we propose the application of generalized perceptual features to control 
      the adaptive sampling of a digital ECG. Firstly, based on temporal distribution of 
      the information density, local ECG bandwidth is estimated and projected to the 
      actual positions of components in heartbeat representation. Next, the local sampling 
      frequency is calculated pointwise and the ECG is adaptively low-pass filtered in all 
      simultaneous channels. Finally, sample values are interpolated at new time positions 
      forming a non-uniform time series. In evaluation of perceptual sampling, an inverse 
      transform was used for the reconstruction of regularly sampled ECG with a percent 
      root-mean-square difference (PRD) error of 3-5% (for compression ratios 3.0-4.7, 
      respectively). Nevertheless, tests performed with the use of the CSE Database show 
      good reproducibility of ECG diagnostic features, within the IEC 60601-2-25:2015 
      requirements, thanks to the occurrence of distortions in less relevant parts of the 
      cardiac cycle.

TI  - Cardioprotective effect of sevoflurane in patients with coronary artery disease 
      undergoing vascular surgery.
PG  - 125-30
LID - 10.4103/1658-354X.97024 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The present study was conducted to evaluate the cardioprotective effect 
      of sevoflurane compared with propofol in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) 
      undergoing peripheral vascular surgery; and to address the question whether a 
      volatile anesthetic might improve cardiac outcome in these patients. METHODS: One 
      hundred twenty-six patients scheduled for elective peripheral vascular surgery were 
      prospectively randomized to receive either sevoflurane inhalation anesthesia or 
      total intravenous anesthesia. ST-segment monitoring was performed continuously 
      during intra- and post-operative 48 h periods. The number of ischemic events and the 
      cumulative duration of ischemia in each patient were recorded. Blood was sampled in 
      all patients for the determination of cTnI. Samples were obtained before the 
      induction of anesthesia, on admission to the ICU, and at 6, 12, 24, and 48 h after 
      admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). Patients were followed-up during their 
      hospital stay for any adverse cardiac events. RESULTS: The incidence of ischemia 
      were comparable among the groups [16 (25%) patients in sevoflurane group vs 24 (39%) 
      patients in propofol group; P=0.126]. Duration, cumulative duration, and magnitude 
      of ST-segment depression of ischemic events in each patient were significantly less 
      in sevoflurane group (P=0.008, 0.048, 0.038, respectively). cTnI levels of the 
      overall population were significantly less in sevoflurane group vs propofol group (P 
      values <0.0001) from 6 h postoperative and onward. Meanwhile, cTnI levels at 6, 12, 
      24, and 48 h after admission to the ICU in patients who presented with ischemic 
      electrocardiographic (ECG) changes were significantly lower in sevoflurane group 
      than in the propofol group (P<0.0001, <0.0001, <0.0001, 0.0003). None of the 
      patients presented with unstable angina, myocardial infarction, congestive heart 
      failure, or serious arrhythmia either during ICU or hospital stay. CONCLUSION: 
      Patients with CAD receiving sevoflurane for peripheral vascular surgery had 
      significantly lower release of cardiac troponin I at 6 h postoperatively and lasting 
      for 48 h than patients receiving propofol for the same procedure with significant 
      decrease in duration, cumulative duration of ischemic events, and degree of ST 
      depression in each patient.

      and Image Quality in ECG-gated CT].
PG  - 536-545
LID - 10.6009/jjrt.2019_JSRT_75.6.536 [doi]
AB  - In electrocardiographic (ECG)-gated computed tomography (CT) for diagnosis of 
      cardiac diseases, radiation dose and image quality are optimized by limiting field 
      of view (FOV) and centering on the heart. However, it is necessary to set wide FOV 
      with large bowtie filter depending on patient positioning or various diagnoses such 
      as aortic diseases. The purpose of this study is to clarify influence of bowtie 
      filter and patient positioning on in-plane dose distribution, organ-absorbed dose, 
      image quality in ECG-gated CT. In-plane dose distribution and organ-absorbed dose 
      were evaluated with radio photoluminescence glass dosimeters, and signal-to-noise 
      ratio (SNR) were measured for evaluation of image quality. The bowtie filter was 
      used small (S) and large (L). With automatic exposure control, volume computed 
      tomography dose index was 55.3 mGy at S and 71.8 mGy at L. The phantom was 
      positioned on the heart of phantom (Heart) and the center of phantom (Body). In 
      Heart-L compared with Heart-S, organ-absorbed dose was 1.29 times at breasts. In 
      Heart-S compared with Body-S, in-plane dose distribution was increased 25% at left 
      anterior and decreased 20% at right posterior. In SNR, S and L were decreased from 
      50 mm off-center. To set appropriate bowtie filter and positioning was reduced 
      radiation dose and improved image quality in ECG-gated CT.

TI  - Nonlinear Heart Rate Variability features for real-life stress detection. Case 
      study: students under stress due to university examination.
PG  - 96
LID - 10.1186/1475-925X-10-96 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study investigates the variations of Heart Rate Variability (HRV) 
      due to a real-life stressor and proposes a classifier based on nonlinear features of 
      HRV for automatic stress detection. METHODS: 42 students volunteered to participate 
      to the study about HRV and stress. For each student, two recordings were performed: 
      one during an on-going university examination, assumed as a real-life stressor, and 
      one after holidays. Nonlinear analysis of HRV was performed by using Poincaré Plot, 
      Approximate Entropy, Correlation dimension, Detrended Fluctuation Analysis, 
      Recurrence Plot. For statistical comparison, we adopted the Wilcoxon Signed Rank 
      test and for development of a classifier we adopted the Linear Discriminant Analysis 
      (LDA). RESULTS: Almost all HRV features measuring heart rate complexity were 
      significantly decreased in the stress session. LDA generated a simple classifier 
      based on the two Poincaré Plot parameters and Approximate Entropy, which enables 
      stress detection with a total classification accuracy, a sensitivity and a 
      specificity rate of 90%, 86%, and 95% respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the 
      current study suggest that nonlinear HRV analysis using short term ECG recording 
      could be effective in automatically detecting real-life stress condition, such as a 
      university examination.

TI  - Anomaly detection in ECG based on trend symbolic aggregate approximation.
PG  - 2154-2167
LID - 10.3934/mbe.2019105 [doi]
AB  - ECG anomaly detection is a necessary approach to detect disease Electrocardiography( 
      ECG) signals before the detail diagnosis process in medical field to gauge the 
      health of the human heart. Nowadays, there are many anomaly detection methods for 
      ECG detection including supervised learning and unsupervised learning. For 
      supervised learning, it requires the knowledge of expert and different types of 
      Arrhythmia data for training. However, since the anomalies are less and unknown in 
      many cases which are di cult to distinguish and be labeled, unsupervised methods are 
      more suitable to detect the ECG anomalies. Furthermore, the existing unsupervised 
      learning studies do not take ECG shape into account where different diseases have 
      different shapes. In this paper, a novel simple trend aggregate approximation method 
      is proposed, the relative binary trend representation are used to record the shape 
      feature in original time series and to detect the anomaly heart signals by 
      similarity comparison. We use the ECG dataset in UCR Time Series Classification 
      Archive to obtain ECG time series data and the experiment results are assessed by 
      means of sensitivity, specificity, false alarm rate measures which is robust and 
      promising with high accuracy.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether correct adherence to clinical guidelines might have 
      led to prevention of cases with adverse neonatal outcome. DESIGN: Secondary analysis 
      of cases with adverse outcome in a multicenter randomized clinical trial. SETTING: 
      Nine Dutch hospitals. POPULATION: Pregnant women with a term singleton fetus in 
      cephalic position. METHODS: Data were obtained from a randomized trial that compared 
      monitoring by STAN® (index group) with cardiotocography (control group). In both 
      trial arms, three observers independently assessed the fetal surveillance results in 
      all cases with adverse neonatal outcome, to determine whether an indication for 
      intervention was present, based on current clinical guidelines. MAIN OUTCOME 
      MEASURES: Adverse neonatal outcome cases fulfilled one or more of the following 
      criteria: (i) metabolic acidosis in umbilical cord artery (pH < 7.05 and base 
      deficit in extracellular fluid >12 mmol/L); (ii) umbilical cord artery pH < 7.00; 
      (iii) perinatal death; and/or (iv) signs of moderate or severe hypoxic ischemic 
      encephalopathy. RESULTS: We studied 5681 women, of whom 61 (1.1%) had an adverse 
      outcome (26 index; 35 control). In these women, the number of performed operative 
      deliveries for fetal distress was 18 (69.2%) and 16 (45.7%), respectively. 
      Reassessment of all 61 cases showed that there was a fetal indication to intervene 
      in 23 (88.5%) and 19 (57.6%) cases, respectively. In 13 (50.0%) vs. 11 (33.3%) 
      cases, respectively, this indication occurred more than 20 min before the time of 
      delivery, meaning that these adverse outcomes could possibly have been prevented. 
      CONCLUSIONS: In our trial, more strict adherence to clinical guidelines could have 
      led to additional identification and prevention of adverse outcome.

TI  - Artificial Neural Network-Based Automatic Detection of Food Intake for 
      Neuromodulation in Treating Obesity and Diabetes.
PG  - 2547-2557

AB  - PURPOSE: Neuromodulation, such as vagal nerve stimulation and intestinal electrical 
      stimulation, has been introduced for the treatment of obesity and diabetes. Ideally, 
      neuromodulation should be applied automatically after food intake. The purpose of 
      this study was to develop a method of automatic food intake detection through 
      dynamic analysis of heart rate variability (HRV). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two 
      experiments were conducted: (1) a small sample series with a standard test meal and 
      (2) a large sample series with varying meal size. Electrocardiograms (ECGs) were 
      collected in the fasting and postprandial states. Each ECG was processed to compute 
      the HRV. For each HRV segment, time- and frequency-domain features were derived and 
      used as inputs to train and test an artificial neural network (ANN). The ANN was 
      trained and tested with different cross-validation methods. RESULTS: The highest 
      classification accuracy reached with leave-one-subject-out-leave-one-sample-out 
      cross-validation was 0.93 in experiment 1 and 0.88 in experiment 2. Retraining the 
      ANN on recordings of a subject drastically increased the achieved accuracy for that 
      subject to values of 0.995 and 0.95 in experiments 1 and 2, respectively. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Automatic food intake detection by ANNs, using features from the HRV, 
      is feasible and may have a great potential for neuromodulation-based treatments of 
      meal-related disorders.

TI  - Spectral analysis of intercycle heart fluctuations in the 
      diethyl-ether-anaesthetized or pithed rat treated with l-hyoscyamine.
PG  - 27-34
AB  - 1. Within the context of neural regulation of the activity of sinus node pacemaker 
      cells, the study of heart rate variability, as explored in the frequency domain by 
      spectral analysis, was proposed about 15 years ago as a quantitative tool for the 
      evaluation of short-term autonomic cardiovascular control. It has since been 
      postulated that the two main oscillations observed, one at low and the other at high 
      frequency, may respectively be markers of sympathetic vs. vagal efferent cardiac 
      activity, and that the low- and high-frequency signals may reflect a reciprocal or 
      'push-pull' relationship between sympathetic and parasympathetic control. 2. In our 
      power spectra assessment, ECG R-R intervals were submitted to fast Fourier 
      transformation analysis in order to study the mechanisms underlying the control of 
      heart beats in rats. Data were acquired in conditions of steady arterial blood 
      pressure and cardiac and respiratory activity (spontaneous or artificially 
      stimulated) in diethyl-ether-anaesthetized and pithed rats, as well as in a group of 
      control rats, all in the presence and absence of l-hyoscyamine. 3. With increasing 
      doses of the parasympathetic antagonist, the fractal dimension of the time-series 
      structure remained stable in most cases. The low-frequency spectral component 
      narrowed with increasing drug doses and the high-frequency band underwent either no, 
      or only very slight, changes. 4. In these rodent assays, the low- and high-frequency 
      signals cannot be interpreted as a push-pull relationship between sympathetic and 
      parasympathetic control.

TI  - Multivariate analysis of TU wave complex on electrocardiogram in Andersen-Tawil 
      syndrome with KCNJ2 mutations.
PG  - e12721
LID - 10.1111/anec.12721 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The exact differences between the TU wave complex of ATS1 and that of 
      healthy individuals remain to be investigated. We sought to characterize the TU wave 
      complex of Andersen-Tawil syndrome type 1 (ATS1) using high frequency 
      electrocardiogram (ECG) data. METHODS: Electrocardiograms were recorded as time 
      series data with a 2 kHz frequency ECG amplifier in 13 patients with ATS1 (positive 
      for KCNJ2 mutation, ATS1 group) and age-matched healthy individuals (control group). 
      Conventional ECG parameters were measured, and principal component analysis (PCA) 
      and independent component analysis (ICA) were applied to the TU wave complex. 
      RESULTS: Time from T peak (Tp) to U peak (Up), time from bottom (B) to Up, and time 
      from B to U end (BUe, U duration) (0.232 ± 0.018 vs. 0.165 ± 0.017, p < .0001), 
      where B is the lowest point between T and U waves, were all longer in the ATS1 group 
      than the control group. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that BUe 
      could completely differentiate the two groups. PCA ratios in the ATS1 group were 
      significantly larger than the control group (26.5 ± 12.3 vs. 10.4 ± 6.2, p = .0005). 
      ICA revealed 1 or 2 U-wave-specific independent components (ICs) that exclusively 
      comprise the U wave in ATS1, whereas U waves in the control group were composed of 
      some ICs that also comprised T waves. CONCLUSIONS: U-wave-related temporal 
      parameters, particularly BUe, and the existence of U-wave-specific ICs, extracted in 
      the ICA, are useful for differentiation of U waves in ATS1 from those in healthy 
      individuals.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Measuring local RV function in adult congenital heart disease (ACHD) 
      with echocardiography or MRI is challenging because of the complex geometry and 
      existing pacing devices. Visual assessment of ventricular function via low-dose 
      cardiac CT has been recently performed. This pilot study assessed whether low-dose 
      4D cine CT combined with automatic measurement of regional shortening could quantify 
      right-ventricular function in ACHD patients. METHODS: Seven patients with Tetralogy 
      of Fallot either contraindicated for MRI or assessed for coronary artery disease and 
      seven non-congenital patients were imaged with ECG-gated cardiac CT utilizing a 
      320-detector row scanner. Right ventricular global function and regional shortening 
      were quantified. RESULTS: Non-congenital patients were imaged with 2.9±2.1mSv and 
      395±359 HU blood-myocardium contrast. The ACHD patients were imaged with 2.1±1.3mSv 
      and 726±296 HU contrast. Right ventricles of the ACHD patients had higher 
      end-diastolic volume (297±107mL vs 123±34mL, p=0.001), lower ejection fraction 
      (32.0±4.9% vs 45.0±6.0%, p=0.001), and higher dyskinetic fraction (10.9±3.7% vs 
      2.6±2.8%, p<0.001) relative to the non-congenital controls. CONCLUSIONS: In this 
      initial pilot study, right ventricular global and regional systolic function were 
      measured using low-dose cine CT with SQUEEZ quantification in non-congenital 
      patients as well as ACHD patients with Tetralogy of Fallot. Unique regional features 
      of RV dyskinesia were identified in the ACHD patients which could yield a more 
      precise quantification of RV function.

TI  - Heart Rate Fragmentation: A Symbolic Dynamical Approach.
PG  - 827
LID - 10.3389/fphys.2017.00827 [doi]
LID - 827
AB  - Background: We recently introduced the concept of heart rate fragmentation along 
      with a set of metrics for its quantification. The term was coined to refer to an 
      increase in the percentage of changes in heart rate acceleration sign, a dynamical 
      marker of a type of anomalous variability. The effort was motivated by the 
      observation that fragmentation, which is consistent with the breakdown of the 
      neuroautonomic-electrophysiologic control system of the sino-atrial node, could 
      confound traditional short-term analysis of heart rate variability. Objective: The 
      objectives of this study were to: (1) introduce a symbolic dynamical approach to the 
      problem of quantifying heart rate fragmentation; (2) evaluate how the distribution 
      of the different dynamical patterns ("words") varied with the participants' age in a 
      group of healthy subjects and patients with coronary artery disease (CAD); and (3) 
      quantify the differences in the fragmentation patterns between the two sample 
      populations. Methods: The symbolic dynamical method employed here was based on a 
      ternary map of the increment NN interval time series and on the analysis of the 
      relative frequency of symbolic sequences (words) with a pre-defined set of features. 
      We analyzed annotated, open-access Holter databases of healthy subjects and patients 
      with CAD, provided by the University of Rochester Telemetric and Holter ECG 
      Warehouse (THEW). Results: The degree of fragmentation was significantly higher in 
      older individuals than in their younger counterparts. However, the fragmentation 
      patterns were different in the two sample populations. In healthy subjects, older 
      age was significantly associated with a higher percentage of transitions from 
      acceleration/deceleration to zero acceleration and vice versa (termed "soft" 
      inflection points). In patients with CAD, older age was also significantly 
      associated with higher percentages of frank reversals in heart rate acceleration 
      (transitions from acceleration to deceleration and vice versa, termed "hard" 
      inflection points). Compared to healthy subjects, patients with CAD had 
      significantly higher percentages of soft and hard inflection points, an increased 
      percentage of words with a high degree of fragmentation and a decreased percentage 
      of words with a lower degree of fragmentation. Conclusion: The symbolic dynamical 
      method employed here was useful to probe the newly recognized property of heart rate 
      fragmentation. The findings from these cross-sectional studies confirm that CAD and 
      older age are associated with higher levels of heart rate fragmentation. 
      Furthermore, fragmentation with healthy aging appears to be phenotypically different 
      from fragmentation in the context of CAD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Automated detection of return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) is still 
      an unsolved problem during cardiac arrest. Current guidelines recommend the use of 
      capnography, but most automatic methods are based on the analysis of the ECG and 
      thoracic impedance (TI) signals. This study analysed the added value of EtCO(2) for 
      discriminating pulsed (PR) and pulseless (PEA) rhythms and its potential to detect 
      ROSC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 426 out-of-hospital cardiac arrest cases, 
      117 with ROSC and 309 without ROSC, were analysed. First, EtCO(2) values were 
      compared for ROSC and no ROSC cases. Second, 5098 artefact free 3-s long segments 
      were automatically extracted and labelled as PR (3639) or PEA (1459) using the 
      instant of ROSC annotated by the clinician on scene as gold standard. Machine 
      learning classifiers were designed using features obtained from the ECG, TI and the 
      EtCO(2) value. Third, the cases were retrospectively analysed using the classifier 
      to discriminate cases with and without ROSC. RESULTS: EtCO(2) values increased 
      significantly from 41 mmHg 3-min before ROSC to 57 mmHg 1-min after ROSC, and 
      EtCO(2) was significantly larger for PR than for PEA, 46 mmHg/20 mmHg (p < 0.05). 
      Adding EtCO(2) to the machine learning models increased their area under the curve 
      (AUC) by over 2 percentage points. The combination of ECG, TI and EtCO(2) had an AUC 
      for the detection of pulse of 0.92. Finally, the retrospective analysis showed a 
      sensitivity and specificity of 96.6% and 94.5% for the detection of ROSC and no-ROSC 
      cases, respectively. CONCLUSION: Adding EtCO(2) improves the performance of 
      automatic algorithms for pulse detection based on ECG and TI. These algorithms can 
      be used to identify pulse on site, and to retrospectively identify cases with ROSC.

TI  - Differences in the Slope of the QT-RR Relation Based on 24-Hour Holter ECG 
      Recordings between Cardioembolic and Atherosclerotic Stroke.
PG  - 2927-2932
AB  - Objective Detecting paroxysmal atrial fibrillation in patients with ischemic stroke 
      presenting in sinus rhythm is difficult because such episodes are often short, and 
      they are also frequently asymptomatic. It is possible that the ventricular 
      repolarization dynamics may reflect atrial vulnerability and cardioembolic stroke. 
      Hence, we compared the QT-RR relation between cardioembolic stroke and 
      atherosclerotic stroke during sinus rhythm. Methods The subjects comprised 62 
      consecutive ischemic stroke patients including 31 with cardioembolic strokes 
      (71.8±12.7 years, 17 men) and 31 with atherosclerotic strokes (74.8±10.8 years, 23 
      men). The QT and RR intervals were measured from ECG waves based on a 15-sec 
      averaged ECG during 24-hour Holter recording using an automatic QT analyzing system. 
      The QT interval dependence on the RR interval was analyzed using a linear regression 
      line for each subject ([QT]=A[RR]+B; where A is the slope and B is the y-intercept). 
      Results The mean slope of the QT-RR relation was significantly greater in 
      cardioembolic stroke than in atherosclerotic stroke (0.187±0.044 vs. 0.142±0.045, 
      p<0.001). The mean QT, RR, or QTc during 24-hour Holter recordings did not differ 
      between them. An increased slope (≥0.14) of the QT-RR regression line could predict 
      cardioembolic stroke with 97% sensitivity, 55% specificity and a positive predictive 
      value of 64%. Conclusion The increased slope of the QT-RR linear regression line 
      based on 24-hour Holter ECG in patients with ischemic stroke presenting in sinus 
      rhythm may therefore be a simple and useful marker for cardioembolic stroke.

TI  - Computer support for experiments on isolated hearts.
PG  - R273-4
AB  - The left ventricular pressure (LVP) and ECG signals that appear during and after 
      ischaemia tend to be very irregular (fibrillation, arrhythmia). Computer based data 
      acquisition system, that we developed to support experiments on isolated 
      Langendorff's rat heart, enabled the usage of methods derived from non-linear 
      dynamics. To classify the irregularity of heart action, ECG and LVP time series have 
      been used to calculate correlation dimension (D2) and largest Lyapunov exponent. We 
      compared the results of signals derived from isolated heart at standard conditions 
      and hearts rendered ischaemic for 60 minutes. Our results show that the level of 
      irregularity can be classified efficiently using the quoted approach.

TI  - Sleep and wake classification with actigraphy and respiratory effort using dynamic 
      warping.
PG  - 1272-84
LID - 10.1109/JBHI.2013.2284610 [doi]
AB  - This paper proposes the use of dynamic warping (DW) methods for improving automatic 
      sleep and wake classification using actigraphy and respiratory effort. DW is an 
      algorithm that finds an optimal nonlinear alignment between two series allowing 
      scaling and shifting. It is widely used to quantify (dis)similarity between two 
      series. To compare the respiratory effort between sleep and wake states by means of 
      (dis)similarity, we constructed two novel features based on DW. For a given epoch of 
      a respiratory effort recording, the features search for the optimally aligned epoch 
      within the same recording in time and frequency domain. This is expected to yield a 
      high (or low) similarity score when this epoch is sleep (or wake). Since the 
      comparison occurs throughout the entire-night recording of a subject, it may reduce 
      the effects of within- and between-subject variations of the respiratory effort, and 
      thus help discriminate between sleep and wake states. The DW-based features were 
      evaluated using a linear discriminant classifier on a dataset of 15 healthy 
      subjects. Results show that the DW-based features can provide a Cohen's Kappa 
      coefficient of agreement κ = 0.59 which is significantly higher than the existing 
      respiratory-based features and is comparable to actigraphy. After combining the 
      actigraphy and the DW-based features, the classifier achieved a κ of 0.66 and an 
      overall accuracy of 95.7%, outperforming an earlier actigraphy- and 
      respiratory-based feature set ( κ = 0.62). The results are also comparable with 
      those obtained using an actigraphy- and cardiorespiratory-based feature set but have 
      the important advantage that they do not require an ECG signal to be recorded.

TI  - Pit-a-Pat: A Smart Electrocardiogram System for Detecting Arrhythmia.
PG  - 814-21
LID - 10.1089/tmj.2014.0187 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Electrocardiogram (ECG) telemonitoring is one of the most promising 
      applications of medical telemetry. However, previous approaches to ECG 
      telemonitoring have largely relied on public databases of ECG results. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: In this article we propose a smart ECG system called Pit-a-Pat, which 
      extracts features from ECG signals and detects arrhythmia. It is designed to run on 
      an Android™ (Google, Mountain View, CA) device, without requiring modifications to 
      other software. RESULTS: We implemented the Pit-a-Pat system using a commercial ECG 
      device, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of 
      Pit-a-Pat for monitoring the ECG signal and analyzing the cardiac activity of a 
      mobile patient. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed system allows monitoring of cardiac 
      activity with automatic analysis, thereby providing a convenient, inexpensive, and 
      ubiquitous adjunct to personal healthcare.

TI  - Automatic Detection and Parameterization of Manual Bag-Mask Ventilation on Newborns.
PG  - 527-538
LID - 10.1109/JBHI.2016.2518238 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Birth asphyxia is a condition where a fetus suffers from lack of oxygen 
      during birth. Intervention by manual ventilation should start within one minute 
      after birth. Bag-mask resuscitators are commonly used in situations where 
      ventilation is provided by a single health care worker. Due to a high complexity of 
      interactions between physiological conditions of the newborns and the clinical 
      treatment, the recommendations for bag-mask ventilation of infants remains 
      controversial. The purpose of this paper is to illustrate the processing and 
      parameterization of ventilation signals recorded from the Laerdal newborn 
      resuscitation monitor into meaningful data. METHODS: Basic signal processing 
      approaches are applied on various signal channels (airway pressure, flow, CO (2), 
      and ECG) to detect events related to ventilation activities. RESULTS: Different 
      types of events are detected and parameterized to describe the characteristics of 
      ventilation procedure. CONCLUSIONS: Efficient detection algorithms as well as 
      parameterization of ventilation events could be useful for retrospective analysis of 
      resuscitation data, for example, by finding the association between different 
      ventilation parameters and positive responses of newborns. SIGNIFICANCE: Information 
      about ventilation events and ventilation parameters could potentially be useful 
      during a resuscitation situation by giving immediate feedback to the health care 
      provider.

TI  - The inverse problem in electrocardiography: solutions in terms of equivalent 
      sources.
PG  - 171-214
AB  - This paper reviews those inverse electrocardiographic solutions that compute the 
      electrical activity of the heart in terms of equivalent sources such as multipoles 
      or multiple dipoles, as opposed to more realistic source formulations such as 
      epicardial potentials. It treats, in succession, inverse solutions in terms of a 
      single fixed-location dipole, a multipole series, moving dipoles, and, finally, 
      multiple fixed-location dipoles. For each category of solution, simulation studies, 
      animal experiments, and work involving human subjects are reviewed. Finally, more 
      recent work that seeks to compute the cardiac activation isochrones, from the time 
      integrals of the torso potentials during the QRS complex of the electrocardiogram, 
      is described. The paper concludes with a discussion on the future of inverse 
      electrocardiographic solutions in terms of equivalent sources.

TI  - Noninvasive fetal electrocardiography: an overview of the signal 
      electrophysiological meaning, recording procedures, and processing techniques.
PG  - 303-13
LID - 10.1111/anec.12259 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Noninvasive fetal electrocardiography (fECG), obtained positioning 
      electrodes on the maternal abdomen, is important in safeguarding the life and the 
      health of the unborn child. This study aims to provide a review of the state of the 
      art of fECG, and includes a description of the parameters useful for fetus clinical 
      evaluation; of the fECG recording procedures; and of the techniques to extract the 
      fECG signal from the abdominal recordings. METHODS: The fetus clinical status is 
      inferred by analyzing growth parameters, supraventricular arrhythmias, ST-segment 
      variability, and fetal-movement parameters from the fECG signal. This can be 
      extracted from an abdominal recording obtained using one of the following two 
      electrode-types configurations: pure-abdominal and mixed. Differently from the 
      former, the latter also provides pure maternal ECG tracings. From a mathematical 
      point of view, the abdominal recording is a summation of three signal components: 
      the fECG signal (i.e., the signal of interest to be extracted), the abdominal 
      maternal ECG (amECG), and the noise. Automatic extraction of fECG includes noise 
      removal by abdominal signal prefiltration (0.5-45 Hz bandpass filter) and amECG 
      cancellation. CONCLUSIONS: Differences among methods rely on different techniques 
      used to extract fECG. If pure abdominal electrode configurations are used, fECG is 
      extracted directly from the abdominal recording using independent component analysis 
      or template subtraction. Eventually, if mixed electrode configurations are used, the 
      fECG can be extracted using the adaptive filtering fed with the maternal ECG 
      recorded by the electrodes located in the woman thorax or shoulder.

TI  - Validity of the Polar V800 monitor for measuring heart rate variability in mountain 
      running route conditions.
PG  - 669-677
LID - 10.1007/s00421-018-3808-0 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: This study was conducted to test, in mountain running route conditions, the 
      accuracy of the Polar V800™ monitor as a suitable device for monitoring the heart 
      rate variability (HRV) of runners. METHOD: Eighteen healthy subjects ran a route 
      that included a range of running slopes such as those encountered in trail and 
      ultra-trail races. The comparative study of a V800 and a Holter SEER 12 ECG 
      Recorder™ included the analysis of RR time series and short-term HRV analysis. A 
      correction algorithm was designed to obtain the corrected Polar RR intervals. Six 
      5-min segments related to different running slopes were considered for each subject. 
      RESULTS: The correlation between corrected V800 RR intervals and Holter RR intervals 
      was very high (r = 0.99, p < 0.001), and the bias was less than 1 ms. The limits of 
      agreement (LoA) obtained for SDNN and RMSSD were (- 0.25 to 0.32 ms) and (- 0.90 to 
      1.08 ms), respectively. The effect size (ES) obtained in the time domain HRV 
      parameters was considered small (ES < 0.2). Frequency domain HRV parameters did not 
      differ (p > 0.05) and were well correlated (r ≥ 0.96, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Narrow 
      limits of agreement, high correlations and small effect size suggest that the Polar 
      V800 is a valid tool for the analysis of heart rate variability in athletes while 
      running high endurance events such as marathon, trail, and ultra-trail races.

TI  - [Methodologic studies in dynamic EMG mapping based on the Hilbert transformation].
PG  - 77-82
AB  - On the basis of Discrete Hilbert Transformation spectral parameters for dynamic EMG 
      analysis can be introduced. Within analysis intervals which are used in the same 
      manner as in spectral analysis, the momentary power of EMG frequency bands can be 
      computed as time series of the same interval duration. A close connection exists 
      between momentary power and the current phenomenology of power spectral analysis 
      because the momentary power of a defined frequency band can be seen as the exact 
      dynamic equivalent of the corresponding mean power value deduced from the power 
      spectrum. A multichannel EMG recording (greater than or equal to 16 channels) makes 
      the representation of the topographical distribution of the spectral parameter by a 
      coloured map possible. Additionally, the momentary power can be used to calculate 
      map sequences. In this way, changes of EMG activity can be quantified by map 
      sequences of an arbitrary time resolution. By calculation of momentary frequency via 
      DHT an artefact detection scheme for ECG interference can be suggested. A completion 
      of this methodology can be carried out by applications of adaptive filtration 
      procedures. Using this concept of EMG processing, a new and common methodical basis 
      of EMG power spectral analysis can be introduced.

PG  - 218.e9-20
LID - 10.1016/j.jcrc.2011.09.009 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of the study was to evaluate the feasibility of continuous heart 
      and respiratory rate variability (HRV and RRV, respectively) monitoring in 
      critically ill patients derived from electrocardiogram (ECG) and end-tidal 
      capnography (etCO(2)) waveforms. METHODS: Thirty-four patients (age, 56.5 ± 15.9 
      years; Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score, 22.8 ± 6.7) 
      underwent continuous recording of ECG and etCO(2) waveforms from intensive care unit 
      admission and intubation to discharge or maximum of 14 days. Overlapping 5-minute 
      windows were analyzed with a wide range of variability measures (time, frequency, 
      entropy, and scale-invariant and nonlinear domains). Waveform data quality, presence 
      of disconnections and arrhythmias, quality of beat and breath detection, and 
      subsequent variability computations were evaluated. RESULTS: Patients were enrolled 
      for 11.0 ± 3.6 days. The proportion of missing waveform data among all patients was 
      (median [interquartile range, maximum]) 2.9% (1.3%-9.7%, 36.4%) for ECG and 3.1% 
      (1.1%-11.4%, 84.5%) for etCO(2). Heart rate variability data loss (ie, proportion of 
      windows removed) was 1.3% (1.0%-2.1%, 5.9%) due to disconnection, 0.6% (0.1%-3.9%, 
      39.5%) due to atrial fibrillation, and 6.6% (1.4%-17.9%, 89.0%) due to data 
      cleaning. Respiratory rate variability data loss was 7.3% (2.9%-11.6%, 47.7%) due to 
      disconnection (or apnea) and 5.5% (2.9%-8.4%, 56.4%) due to cleaning. Continuous 
      individualized multiorgan variability analysis processing resulted in HRV and RRV 
      computations for 81.2% ± 25.0% and 87.5% ± 11.9% of available ECG and etCO(2) 
      waveform data, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The quality of continuously recorded ECG 
      and etCO(2) waveforms in critically ill patients is adequate for subsequent 
      continuous variability monitoring in this pilot study. The clinical utility of 
      continuous variability analysis merits further investigation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Pre-procedural TAVI planning requires highly sophisticated and 
      time-consuming manual measurements performed by experienced readers. Semi-automatic 
      software may assist with partial automation of assessment of multiple parameters. 
      The aim of this study was to evaluate differences between manual and semi-automatic 
      measurements in terms of agreement and time. METHODS: One hundred and twenty TAVI 
      candidates referred for the retrospectively ECG-gated CTA (2nd and 3rd generation 
      dual source CT) were evaluated. Fully manual and semi-automatic measurements of 
      fourteen aortic root parameters were assessed in the 20% phase of the R-R interval. 
      Reading time was compared using paired samples t-test. Inter-software agreement was 
      calculated using the Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) in a 2-way mixed 
      effects model. Differences between manual and semi-automatic measurements were 
      evaluated using Bland-Altman analysis. RESULTS: The time needed for evaluation using 
      semi-automatic assessment (3 min 24 s ± 1 min 7 s) was significantly lower (p<0.001) 
      compared to a fully manual approach (6 min 31 sec ± 1 min 1 sec). Excellent 
      inter-software agreement was found (ICC = 0.93 ± 0.0; range:0.90-0.95). The same 
      prosthesis size from manual and semi-automatic measurements was selected in 92% of 
      cases, when sizing was based on annular area. Prosthesis sizing based on annular 
      short diameter and perimeter agreed in 99% and 96% cases, respectively. CONCLUSION: 
      Use of semi-automatic software in pre-TAVI evaluation results in comparable results 
      in respect of measurements and selected valve prosthesis size, while necessary 
      reading time is significantly lower.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Road Traffic Accidents (RTA) are most probably the leading cause of post 
      traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in developed countries. The autonomic nervous 
      system (ANS) disturbances, due to psychological trauma, are part of the 
      pathophysiology of PTSD. The aim of the present study was to determine whether early 
      heart rate variability (HRV) measurement, a biomarker of the ANS function, could act 
      as a predictor of PTSD development after a RTA. METHODS: We prospectively 
      investigated 35 survivors of RTA with both physical injury and psychological trauma. 
      HRV data were obtained from 24-h Holter ECG monitoring, which was performed on the 
      second day after the accident. Time domain analysis was applied to the inter-beat 
      (RR) interval time series to calculate the various parameters of HRV. PTSD status 
      was assessed 2 and 6 months after RTA. RESULTS: There was a global diminution of HRV 
      measurements in the PTSD group at both 2 and 6 months. The variability index was the 
      best predictor of PTSD with the area under the receiveroperating curve for 
      discriminating PTSD at 6 months at 0.92 (95% CI: 0.785; 1.046). A cut-off at 2.19% 
      yielded a sensitivity of 85.7% and a specificity of 81.8% for PTSD. Positive and 
      negative predictive values were respectively 75% and 90%. However, initial heart 
      rate (HR) data were relevant at 2 months but not at 6 months. CONCLUSION: RTA 
      survivors exhibiting lower parasympathetic modulation of HR, indexed by temporal 
      analysis of HRV, are more susceptible to developing PTSD as a short and long-term 
      outcome.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Automatic electrocardiogram (ECG) heartbeat 
      classification is substantial for diagnosing heart failure. The aim of this paper is 
      to evaluate the effect of machine learning methods in creating the model which 
      classifies normal and congestive heart failure (CHF) on the long-term ECG time 
      series. METHODS: The study was performed in two phases: feature extraction and 
      classification phase. In feature extraction phase, autoregressive (AR) Burg method 
      is applied for extracting features. In classification phase, five different 
      classifiers are examined namely, C4.5 decision tree, k-nearest neighbor, support 
      vector machine, artificial neural networks and random forest classifier. The ECG 
      signals were acquired from BIDMC Congestive Heart Failure and PTB Diagnostic ECG 
      databases and classified by applying various experiments. RESULTS: The experimental 
      results are evaluated in several statistical measures (sensitivity, specificity, 
      accuracy, F-measure and ROC curve) and showed that the random forest method gives 
      100% classification accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: Impressive performance of random forest 
      method proves that it plays significant role in detecting congestive heart failure 
      (CHF) and can be valuable in expressing knowledge useful in medicine.

TI  - An integrated diabetic index using heart rate variability signal features for 
      diagnosis of diabetes.
PG  - 222-34
LID - 10.1080/10255842.2011.616945 [doi]
AB  - Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals are difficult to interpret, and clinicians must 
      undertake a long training process to learn to diagnose diabetes from subtle 
      abnormalities in these signals. To facilitate these diagnoses, we have developed a 
      technique based on the heart rate variability signal obtained from ECG signals. This 
      technique uses digital signal processing methods and, therefore, automates the 
      detection of diabetes from ECG signals. In this paper, we describe the signal 
      processing techniques that extract features from heart rate (HR) signals and present 
      an analysis procedure that uses these features to diagnose diabetes. Through 
      statistical analysis, we have identified the correlation dimension, Poincaré 
      geometry properties (SD2), and recurrence plot properties (REC, DET, L(mean)) as 
      useful features. These features differentiate the HR data of diabetic patients from 
      those of patients who do not have the illness, and have been validated by using the 
      AdaBoost classifier with the perceptron weak learner (yielding a classification 
      accuracy of 86%). We then developed a novel diabetic integrated index (DII) that is 
      a combination of these nonlinear features. The DII indicates whether a particular HR 
      signal was taken from a person with diabetes. This index aids the automatic 
      detection of diabetes, thereby allowing a more objective assessment and freeing 
      medical professionals for other tasks.

PG  - 1380348

LID - 1380348
AB  - Automatic detection and classification of life-threatening arrhythmia plays an 
      important part in dealing with various cardiac conditions. In this paper, a novel 
      method for classification of various types of arrhythmia using morphological and 
      dynamic features is presented. Discrete wavelet transform (DWT) is applied on each 
      heart beat to obtain the morphological features. It provides better time and 
      frequency resolution of the electrocardiogram (ECG) signal, which helps in decoding 
      important information of a quasiperiodic ECG using variable window sizes. RR 
      interval information is used as a dynamic feature. The nonlinear dynamics of RR 
      interval are captured using Teager energy operator, which improves the arrhythmia 
      classification. Moreover, to remove redundancy, DWT subbands are subjected to 
      dimensionality reduction using independent component analysis, and a total of twelve 
      coefficients are selected as morphological features. These hybrid features are 
      combined and fed to a neural network to classify arrhythmia. The proposed algorithm 
      has been tested over MIT-BIH arrhythmia database using 13724 beats and MIT-BIH 
      supraventricular arrhythmia database using 22151 beats. The proposed methodology 
      resulted in an improved average accuracy of 99.75% and 99.84% for class- and 
      subject-oriented scheme, respectively, using three-fold cross validation.

AB  - Malignant arrhythmia can lead to sudden cardiac death (SCD). Shockable arrhythmia 
      can be terminated with device electrical shock therapies. Ventricular-tachycardia 
      (VT) and ventricular fibrillation (VF) are responsive to electrical anti-tachycardia 
      pacing therapy and defibrillation which help to restore normal electrical and 
      mechanical function of the heart. In contrast, non-shockable arrhythmia like 
      asystole and bradycardia are not responsive to electric shock therapy. 
      Distinguishing between shockable and non-shockable arrhythmia is an important 
      diagnostic challenge that has practical clinical relevance. It is difficult to 
      accurately differentiate between these two types of arrhythmia by manual inspection 
      of electrocardiogram (ECG) segments within the short time duration before triggering 
      the device for electrical therapy. Automated defibrillators are equipped with 
      automatic shockable arrhythmia detection algorithms based on ECG morphological 
      features, which may possess variable diagnostic performance depending on machine 
      models. In our work, we have designed a robust system using wavelet decomposition 
      filter banks for extraction of features from the ECG signal and then classifying the 
      features. We believe this method will improve the accuracy of discriminating between 
      shockable and non-shockable arrhythmia compared with existing conventional 
      algorithms. We used a novel three channel orthogonal wavelet filter bank, which 
      extracted features from ECG epochs of duration 2 s to distinguish between shockable 
      and non-shockable arrhythmia. The fuzzy, Renyi and sample entropies are extracted 
      from the various wavelet coefficients and fed to support vector machine (SVM) 
      classifier for automated classification. We have obtained an accuracy of 98.9%, 
      sensitivity and specificity of 99.08% and 97.11.9%, respectively, using 10-fold 
      cross validation. The area under the receiver operating characteristic has been 
      found to be 0.99 with F1-score of 0.994. The system developed is more accurate than 
      the existing algorithms. Hence, the proposed system can be employed in automated 
      defibrillators inside and outside hospitals for emergency revival of patients 
      suffering from SCD. These automated defibrillators can also be implanted inside the 
      human body for automatic detection of potentially fatal shockable arrhythmia and to 
      deliver an appropriate electric shock to the heart.

AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the dose reduction potential of low kV triple-rule-out 
      dual-source CT angiography (TRO-CTA) in non-obese (BMI ≤ 25 kg/m(2)) patients with 
      acute chest pain. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty consecutive patients were randomly 
      assigned to two different retrospectively ECG-gated TRO-CTA protocols in this 
      prospective trial: Thirty patients were examined with a 120-kV standard protocol 
      (320 reference mAs with automatic tube current modulation, automatically adapted 
      pitch and ECG-pulsing) and served as the control group (group 1), an otherwise 
      identical 100 kV protocol was used in the other thirty patients (group 2) for a 
      radiation dose reduction. Subjective image quality was assessed on a 5 point scale 
      (1: excellent, 5: non-diagnostic) by two blinded observers. Quantitative image 
      analysis assessed vascular attenuation, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and 
      contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) in different vascular segments. The effective dose was 
      calculated from the dose length product (DLP) using a conversion coefficient of 
      0.017 mSvmGy(-1)cm(-1). RESULTS: There was no significant difference of age, BMI, 
      heart rate, pitch or scan length between both patient groups. Subjective image 
      quality was rated similar in both groups (group 1: 1.2 ± 0.4, group 2: average 
      score=1.3 ± 0.5). Vessel attenuation was significantly higher in group 2 than in 
      group 1 (ascending aorta: 456 ± 83 HU vs. 370 ± 78 HU, p<0.001; pulmonary artery: 
      468 ± 118 HU vs. 411 ± 91 HU, p=0.03; left coronary artery: 437 ± 110 HU vs. 348 ± 
      89 HU, p<0.001), however, there was no significant difference in SNR (13.2 ± 7.6 vs. 
      14.5 ± 7.5, p=0.49) or CNR (13.8 ± 6.6 vs. 15.9 ± 7.7, p=0.25). The effective 
      radiation dose of the 100 kV protocol was significantly lower (9.6 ± 3.2 mSv vs. 
      18.1 ± 9.4 mSv, p<0.0001). CONCLUSION: TRO-CTA with 100 kV is feasible in non-obese 
      patients and results in diagnostic image quality and significantly reduced radiation 
      dose.

TI  - High prevalence of corrected QT interval prolongation in acutely ill patients is 
      associated with mortality: results of the QT in Practice (QTIP) Study.
PG  - 394-9
LID - 10.1097/CCM.0b013e318232db4a [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To test the potential value of more frequent QT interval measurement in 
      hospitalized patients. DESIGN: We performed a prospective, observational study. 
      SETTING: All adult intensive care unit and progressive care unit beds of a 
      university medical center. PATIENTS: All patients admitted to one of six critical 
      care units over a 2-month period were included in analyses. INTERVENTIONS: All 
      critical care beds (n = 154) were upgraded to a continuous QT monitoring system 
      (Philips Healthcare). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: QT data were extracted from the 
      bedside monitors for offline analysis. A corrected QT interval >500 msecs was 
      considered prolonged. Episodes of QT prolongation were manually over-read. 
      Electrocardiogram data (67,648 hrs, mean 65 hrs/patient) were obtained. QT 
      prolongation was present in 24%. There were 16 cardiac arrests, with one resulting 
      from Torsade de Pointes (6%). Predictors of QT prolongation were female sex, 
      QT-prolonging drugs, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, hyperglycemia, high creatinine, 
      history of stroke, and hypothyroidism. Patients with QT prolongation had longer 
      hospitalization (276 hrs vs. 132 hrs, p < .0005) and had three times the odds for 
      all-cause in-hospital mortality compared to patients without QT prolongation (odds 
      ratio 2.99 95% confidence interval 1.1-8.1). CONCLUSIONS: We find QT prolongation to 
      be common (24%), with Torsade de Pointes representing 6% of in-hospital cardiac 
      arrests. Predictors of QT prolongation in the acutely ill population are similar to 
      those previously identified in ambulatory populations. Acutely ill patients with QT 
      prolongation have longer lengths of hospitalization and nearly three times the odds 
      for mortality then those without QT prolongation.

TI  - A Cycling Movement Based System for Real-Time Muscle Fatigue and Cardiac Stress 
      Monitoring and Analysis.

AB  - In this study, we defined a new parameter, referred to as the cardiac stress index 
      (CSI), using a nonlinear detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) of heart rate (HR). 
      Our study aimed to incorporate the CSI into a cycling based fatigue monitoring 
      system developed in our previous work so the muscle fatigue and cardiac stress can 
      be both continuously and quantitatively assessed for subjects undergoing the cycling 
      exercise. By collecting electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, the DFA scaling exponent α 
      was evaluated on the RR time series extracted from a windowed ECG segment. We then 
      obtained the running estimate of α by shifting a one-minute window by a step of 20 
      seconds so the CSI, defined as the percentage of all the less-than-one α values, can 
      be synchronously updated every 20 seconds. Since the rating of perceived exertion 
      (RPE) scale is considered as a convenient index which is commonly used to monitor 
      subjective perceived exercise intensity, we then related the Borg RPE scale value to 
      the CSI in order to investigate and quantitatively characterize the relationship 
      between exercise-induced fatigue and cardiac stress. Twenty-two young healthy 
      participants were recruited in our study. Each participant was asked to maintain a 
      fixed pedaling speed at a constant load during the cycling exercise. Experimental 
      results showed that a decrease in DFA scaling exponent α or an increase in CSI was 
      observed during the exercise. In addition, the Borg RPE scale and CSI were 
      positively correlated, suggesting that the factors due to cardiac stress might also 
      contribute to fatigue state during physical exercise. Since the CSI can effectively 
      quantify the cardiac stress status during physical exercise, our system may be used 
      in sports medicine, or used by cardiologists who carried out stress tests for 
      monitoring heart condition in patients with heart diseases.

TI  - Actionable Ventricular Tachycardia During In-Hospital ECG Monitoring and Its Impact 
      on Alarm Fatigue.
PG  - 79-86
LID - 10.1097/HPC.0000000000000216 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ventricular tachycardia (V-tach) is the most common lethal arrhythmia, 
      yet 90% of alarms are false and contribute to alarm fatigue. We hypothesize that 
      some true V-tach also causes alarm fatigue because current criteria are too 
      sensitive (i.e., ≥6 beats ≥100 beats/min [bpm]). PURPOSE: This study was designed to 
      determine (1) the proportion of clinically actionable true V-tach events; (2) 
      whether true actionable versus nonactionable V-tach differs in terms of heart rate 
      and/or duration (seconds); and (3) if actionable V-tach is associated with adverse 
      outcomes. METHODS: This was a secondary analysis in 460 intensive care unit (ICU) 
      patients. Electronic health records were examined to determine if a V-tach event was 
      actionable or nonactionable. Actionable V-tach was defined if a clinical action(s) 
      was taken within 15 minutes of its occurrence (i.e., new and/or change of 
      medication, defibrillation, and/or laboratory test). Maximal heart rate and duration 
      for each V-tach event were measured from bedside monitor electrocardiography. 
      Adverse patient outcomes included a code blue event and/or death. RESULTS: In 460 
      ICU patients, 50 (11%) had 151 true V-tach events (range 1-20). Of the 50 patients, 
      40 (80%) had only nonactionable V-tach (97 events); 3 (6%) had both actionable and 
      nonactionable V-tach (32 events); and 7 patients (14%) had only actionable V-tach 
      (23 events). There were differences in duration comparing actionable versus 
      nonactionable V-tach (mean 56.19 ± 116.87 seconds vs. 4.28 ± 4.09 seconds; P = 
      0.001) and maximal heart rate (188.81 ± 116.83 bpm vs. 150.79 ± 28.26 bpm; P = 
      0.001). Of the 50 patients, 3 (6%) had a code blue, 2 died, and all were in the 
      actionable V-tach group. CONCLUSIONS: In our sample, <1% experienced a code blue 
      following true V-tach. Heart rate and duration for actionable V-tach were much 
      faster and longer than that for nonactionable V-tach. Current default settings 
      typically used for electrocardiographic monitoring (i.e., ≥6 beats ≥100 bpm) appear 
      to be too conservative and can lead to crisis/red level nuisance alarms that 
      contribute to alarm fatigue. A prospective study designed to test whether adjusting 
      default settings to these higher levels is safe for patients is needed.

TI  - Analyzing single-lead short ECG recordings using dense convolutional neural networks 
      and feature-based post-processing to detect atrial fibrillation.
PG  - 084003
LID - 10.1088/1361-6579/aad5bd [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The prevalence of atrial fibrillation (AF) in the general population is 
      0.5%-1%. As AF is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia that is associated 
      with an increased morbidity and mortality, its timely diagnosis is clinically 
      desirable. The main aim of this study as our contribution to the PhysioNet/CinC 
      Challenge 2017 was to develop an automatic algorithm for classification of normal 
      sinus rhythm (NSR), AF, other rhythm (O), and noise using a short single-channel 
      ECG. Furthermore, the impact of changing labels/annotations on performance of the 
      proposed algorithm was studied in this article. APPROACH: The challenge training 
      dataset (8528 ECG recordings) and a complementary dataset (6312 ECG recordings) from 
      other sources were used for algorithm development. Version 3 (v3), which is an 
      updated version of the annotations at the official phase of the challenge (v2), was 
      used in this study. In the proposed algorithm, densely connected convolutional 
      networks were combined with feature-based post-processing after initial signal 
      quality analysis for the classification of ECG recordings. MAIN RESULTS: The F1 
      scores for classification of NSR, AF, and O were 0.91, 0.83, and 0.72, respectively, 
      which led to a F1 of 0.82. There was a small or no performance difference between 
      the top entries in the official phase of the challenge and our proposed method. An 
      increase of 2.5% in F1 score was observed when the same annotations for training and 
      test was used (using v3 annotations) compared to using different annotations (v2 
      annotations for training and v3 annotations for the test). SIGNIFICANCE: Our 
      promising results suggest that the availability of more data with improved labeling 
      along with improvement in signal quality analysis make our algorithm suitable for 
      practical clinical applications.

PG  - 445-51
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of circadian 
      behavior of blood pressure, left ventricular hypertrophy, and autonomic function on 
      QTc interval duration in untreated hypertensive patients. DESIGN: Hypertensive 
      patients underwent simultaneous blood pressure and ECG 24-h ambulatory monitoring. 
      Patients were classified into two groups on the basis of a lack of nocturnal fall in 
      blood pressure, as dippers and nondippers. A group of normotensive healthy subjects 
      was studied as controls. METHODS: QT and QTc intervals were automatically computed 
      and spectral analysis was applied to RR interval time series from the same 
      electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings. Left ventricular mass index (LVMI) was computed 
      by echocardiogram. RESULTS: No difference among the three groups was found 
      concerning mean values and circadian pattern of heart rate; by contrast, QTc was 
      significantly longer in nondippers compared to dippers or to normotensive subjects, 
      particularly at night-time, whereas all groups exhibited similar circadian 
      variations in heart rate. Compared to dippers, nondippers showed significantly 
      higher LVMI, which positively correlated with QTc, and parasympathetic withdrawal, 
      which negatively correlated with QTc. CONCLUSIONS: Nondippers show a prolonged 
      ventricular repolarization throughout the 24-h period, absent either in dippers or 
      normotensives. The association of left ventricular hypertrophy and vagal 
      deactivation may lead to prolongation of QTc, potentially facilitating ventricular 
      arrhythmias in nondipper hypertensive patients.

AB  - Automatic diagnosis of cardiac events is a current problem of interest in which deep 
      learning has shown promising success. We have earlier reported the use of Long Short 
      Term Memory (LSTM) networks-trained on normal ECG patterns-to the detection of 
      anomalies from the prediction errors for real-time diagnostic applications. In this 
      work, we extend our anomaly detection algorithm by introducing a second stage 
      predictor that can identify the actual anomaly class from the error outputs of the 
      first stage model. Results from seven types of anomalies have been presented 
      including Atrial Premature Contraction (APC), Paced Beat (PB), Premature Ventricular 
      Contraction (PVC), Right Bundle Branch Block (RBBB), Ventricular Bigeminy (VB), 
      Ventricular Couplets (VCs) and Ventricular Tachycardia (VT). To optimize anomaly 
      class prediction performance, multiple choices of second stage models such as 
      multilayer perceptron (MLP), support vector machine (SVM) and logistic regression 
      have been employed. A featurization scheme for LSTM prediction errors in the form of 
      overall summaries has been proposed and a successful predictor for the same was 
      developed with good performance. Our results indicate that the error vectors 
      represented by their summary features carry useful predictive information about 
      actual ECG anomaly type. We discuss how the accuracy scores without attention to 
      inherent class imbalances and paucity of data instances may produce misleading 
      performance estimates and hence accurate background models are needed to estimate 
      true predictive performance of multi-class predictors such as those presented in 
      this work. The training data sets and related resources for this study are provided

TI  - A new way to analyze resuscitation quality by reviewing automatic external 
      defibrillator data.
PG  - 171-6
LID - 10.1016/j.resuscitation.2011.10.025 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: High quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) plays an important role in 
      survival of out-of-hospital cardiac arrests (OHCAs). We have developed an algorithm 
      to automatically identify the quality of chest compressions from data retrieved from 
      automatic external defibrillators (AEDs). METHODS: Electrocardiographic (ECG) 
      signals retrieved from AEDs were analyzed by a newly developed algorithm to identify 
      fluctuations in CPR. The algorithm contained three steps. First, it decomposed the 
      AED signals into several intrinsic mode fluctuations (IMFs) by empirical mode 
      decomposition (EMD). Second, it identified the dominant IMFs that carried the chest 
      compression signals and weighted the IMFs to both enhance the chest compression 
      oscillations and filter the noise. Third, it calculated the autocorrelation function 
      (ACF) of the reconstructed signals and tested their periodicity. Using this 
      algorithm, several CPR quality indicators were automatically calculated 
      minute-by-minute and compared with those derived by audio and visual review of AED 
      data by experienced physicians. RESULTS: A total of 77 (29 women, 48 men) OHCA 
      patients were enrolled, and 351 one-min segments were analyzed. The results showed 
      that the CPR quality parameters calculated from the algorithm were highly correlated 
      with those from the manual review (all P<0.001). The limits of agreement by 
      Bland-Altman analysis were acceptable for chest compression number, total flow time, 
      and no flow time, but not for CPR rate. We also demonstrated that only 41.8±29.8% of 
      time was spent in chest compressions and only 7.5±16.8% was spent in adequate chest 
      compressions. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated that several indicators of CPR 
      quality can be precisely and automatically determined by analyzing the ECG signals 
      from AEDs using EMD and autocorrelograms.

TI  - The STAT-MI (ST-Segment Analysis Using Wireless Technology in Acute Myocardial 
      Infarction) trial improves outcomes.
PG  - 222-7
LID - 10.1016/j.jcin.2010.11.007 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The goal of this study was to evaluate the impact of the STAT-MI 
      (ST-Segment Analysis Using Wireless Technology in Acute Myocardial Infarction) 
      network on outcomes in the treatment of patients presenting with ST-segment 
      elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). BACKGROUND: Shortening door-to-balloon 
      (D2B) time remains a national priority for the treatment of STEMI. We previously 
      reported a fully automated wireless network (STAT-MI) for transmission of 
      electrocardiograms (ECGs) for suspected STEMI from the field to offsite 
      cardiologists, allowing early triage with shortening of subsequent D2B times. We now 
      report the impact of the STAT-MI wireless network on infarct size, length of 
      hospital stay (LOS), and mortality. METHODS: A fully automated wireless network 
      (STAT-MI) was developed to enable automatic 12-lead ECG transmission and direct 
      communication between emergency medical services personnel and offsite cardiologists 
      that facilitated direct triage of patients to the cardiac catheterization 
      laboratory. Demographic, laboratory, and time interval data of STAT-MI network 
      patients were prospectively collected over a 33-month period and compared with 
      concurrent control patients who presented with STEMI through non-STAT-MI pathways. 
      RESULTS: From June 2006 through February 2009, 92 patients presented via the STAT-MI 
      network, and 50 patients presented through non-STAT-MI pathways (control group). 
      Baseline clinical and demographic variables were similar in both groups. Overall, 
      compared with control subjects, STAT-MI patients had significantly shorter D2B times 
      (63 [42 to 87] min vs. 119 [96 to 178] min, U = 779.5, p < 0.00004), significantly 
      lower peak troponin I (39.5 [11 to 120.5] ng/ml vs. 87.6 [38.4 to 227] ng/ml, U = 
      889.5, p = 0.005) and creatine phosphokinase-MB (126.1 [37.2 to 280.5] ng/ml vs. 
      290.3 [102.4 to 484] ng/ml, U = 883, p = 0.001), higher left ventricular ejection 
      fractions (50% [35 to 55] vs. 35% [25 to 52], U = 1,075, p = 0.004), and shorter LOS 
      (3 [2 to 4] days vs. 5.5 [3.5 to 10.5] days, U = 378, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: A 
      fully automated, field-based, wireless network that transmits ECGs automatically to 
      offsite cardiologists for the early evaluation and triage of patients with STEMI 
      shortens D2B times, reduces infarct size, limits ejection fraction reduction, and 
      shortens LOS.

AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the utility of using continuous 
      heart rate variability (HRV) and respiratory rate variability (RRV) monitoring for 
      (a) tracking daily organ dysfunction in critically ill patients and (b) identifying 
      patterns of variability changes during onset of shock and resolution of respiratory 
      failure. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-three critically ill patients experiencing 
      respiratory and/or cardiac failure underwent continuous recording of their 
      electrocardiogram and capnogram (CO2) waveforms from admission or intubation until 
      discharge (maximum 14 days). HRV and RRV were computed in 5-minute overlapping 
      windows, using Continuous Individualized Multi-organ Variability Analysis software. 
      Multiple organ dysfunction scores were recorded daily. HRV and RRV trajectories were 
      characterized during onset of shock and resolution of respiratory failure. RESULTS: 
      Both HRV and RRV decreased with increasing severity of multiple organ dysfunction 
      scores for a variety of variability metrics. A decline in several measures of HRV 
      and no decline in RRV were observed before onset of shock (n=6). In contrast, during 
      resolution of respiratory failure, an increase in RRV was observed in patients who 
      successfully passed extubation (n=12), with no change in RRV in those who 
      subsequently failed extubation (n=2). CONCLUSIONS: There is an association between 
      reduced HRV and RRV and increasing organ dysfunction in critically ill patients. The 
      significance of observing trends of decreasing HRV (with onset of shock) and 
      increasing RRV (with resolution of respiratory failure) merits further 
      investigation.

TI  - Automatic Detection of Obstructive Sleep Apnea Using Wavelet Transform and 
      Entropy-Based Features From Single-Lead ECG Signal.
PG  - 1011-1021
LID - 10.1109/JBHI.2018.2842919 [doi]
AB  - Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a prevalent sleep disorder and highly affects the 
      quality of human life. Currently, gold standard for OSA detection is polysomnogram. 
      Since this method is time consuming and cost inefficient, practical systems focus on 
      the usage of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals for OSA detection. In this paper, a 
      novel automatic OSA detection method using a single-lead ECG signal has been 
      proposed. A nonlinear feature extraction using wavelet transform (WT) coefficients 
      obtained by an ECG signal decomposition is employed. In addition, different 
      classification methods are investigated. ECG signals are decomposed into eight 
      levels using a Symlet function as a mother Wavelet function with third order. Then, 
      the entropy-based features including fuzzy/approximate/sample/correct conditional 
      entropy as well as other nonlinear features including interquartile range, mean 
      absolute deviation, variance, Poincare plot, and recurrence plot are extracted from 
      WT coefficients. The best features are chosen using the automatic sequential forward 
      feature selection algorithm. In order to assess the introduced method, 95 
      single-lead ECG recordings are used. The support vector machine classifier having a 
      radial basis function kernel leads to an accuracy of 94.63% (sensitivity: 94.43% and 
      specificity: 94.77%) and 95.71% (sensitivity: 95.83% and specificity: 95.66%) for 
      minute-by-minute and subject-by-subject classifications, respectively. The results 
      show that applying entropy-based features for extracting hidden information of the 
      ECG signals outperforms other available automatic OSA detection methods. The results 
      indicate that a highly accurate OSA detection is attained by just exploiting the 
      single-lead ECG signals. Furthermore, due to the low computational load in the 
      proposed method, it can easily be applied to the home monitoring systems.

TI  - Electrocardiographic ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction in critically ill 
      patients: an observational cohort analysis.
PG  - 2304-9
LID - 10.1097/CCM.0b013e3181fa02cd [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the specificity of the electrocardiographic diagnosis of 
      ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction in the critical care unit setting. 
      DESIGN: Retrospective observational cohort analysis. SETTING: An 880-bed tertiary 
      care teaching hospital with 120 intensive care unit beds. PATIENTS: The population 
      included medical, surgical, trauma, and neurosurgical intensive care unit patients. 
      INTERVENTIONS: Electrocardiograms were systematically collected to include all 
      consecutive recordings over a 15-month period in which the interpretation software 
      indicated ***ACUTE MI***. Patient demographics, markers of intensive care unit 
      complexity, and hospital mortality were ascertained. The electrocardiograms were 
      then further evaluated by a blinded, board-certified cardiologist for agreement or 
      disagreement with the interpretation software. Serum troponin measurements obtained 
      within 96 hrs of electrocardiogram acquisition were used to determine the likelihood 
      of myocardial infarction. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Over the 15-month study 
      period, the interpretation software diagnosed ST-segment elevation myocardial 
      infarction in 67 of 2243 intensive care unit patients (2.99%) who had an 
      electrocardiogram performed. In the final study population of 46 cases with 
      electrocardiographic ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, 85% had peak 
      troponin elevation<5 ng/mL, a strong suggestion against clinical ST-segment 
      elevation myocardial infarction. The cardiologist agreed with the computer 
      interpretation in 39% (18 of 46) of cases, but of those 18 patients, only six showed 
      a significant rise in the troponin level. The cardiologist disagreed with the 
      computer interpretation in 60.9% (28 of 46) of cases and of those, one patient had a 
      marked elevation of the cardiac troponin. CONCLUSIONS: ST-segment elevation 
      myocardial infarction in the intensive care unit is a relatively common 
      electrocardiographic reading both by standard interpretation software and by expert 
      evaluation. In contrast to nonintensive care unit patients who present with chest 
      pain, the electrocardiographic ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction diagnosis 
      seems to be a nonspecific finding in the intensive care unit that is frequently the 
      result of a variety of nonischemic processes. The vast majority of such patients do 
      not have frank ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction.

TI  - Technology Assessment: Early Sense for Monitoring Vital Signs in Hospitalized 
      Patients.
BTI - VA Evidence Synthesis Program Evidence Briefs
AB  - The EarlySense Monitoring System has been developed to provide continuous monitoring 
      of heart rate (HR), respiration rate (RR), and bed motion for patients in 
      medical/surgical, oncology, orthopedics, isolation, post-partum, skilled nursing 
      facilities, long term acute care, and rehabilitation settings. The VA Office of the 
      Deputy Under Secretary for Health for Policy and Services (10P) requested an 
      independent evaluation from the VA Evidence-based Synthesis Program (ESP) to help 
      guide the field as to EarlySense's monitoring capabilities, benefits and harms, 
      impact on nurse staffing, and the overall effectiveness of the system. The USH seeks 
      to better understand how this technology is being used in similar hospital settings 
      in the US, what kinds of VA patients would be best served by it, and whether there 
      are particular types of units or distribution of beds within those units for which 
      this technology would be best suited. The ESP review team searched for and 
      critically appraised relevant studies and systematic reviews and interviewed key 
      informants, including VA nurses who have experience with the EarlySense system. In 
      addition, we requested a Product Brief from the ECRI Institute, which is intended to 
      serve as a companion to our report. WHAT IS EARLYSENSE? EarlySense is a low-acuity 
      continuous monitor. As shown in the figure below, EarlySense consists of (1) a 
      sensor that is placed under the patient's mattress, (2) a bedside monitor, (3) a 
      central display station, and (4) proprietary analytic software that runs on a PC 
      (not shown). The system is based on a piezoelectric sensor, sensitive to applied 
      mechanical strains. The system differs from other patient monitoring systems in that 
      it is a contactless device which eliminates the use of telemetry leads. While the 
      patient is lying flat in bed, the system continuously records heart rate (HR), 
      respiration rate (RR), and bed motion. Low-acuity systems do not provide cardiac 
      waveforms (rhythm strips). They can display oxygen saturation if that is monitored 
      using a separate system. EarlySense does not interface with the electronic medical 
      record. Every 0.5 seconds, an updated HR reading is established based on analysis of 
      the heart pulse pattern for the last 8 seconds, and an updated RR reading based on 
      analysis of the last 1 minute of the respiration pattern. The system provides alerts 
      if any of the parameters exceed predefined thresholds, which can be customized. 
      Alerts can also be sent directly to nurses' mobile phones or pagers. EarlySense also 
      provides bed exit alerts for patients at risk of falls, and includes a timer to 
      remind nurses to turn patients (to help prevent the development of pressure ulcers). 
      EarlySense can monitor up to 40 beds at one time. EarlySense received FDA 510(K) 
      clearance as a Class II device based on demonstration that it was equivalent to 
      devices that are used to monitor vital signs in patients undergoing sleep studies 
      and in ambulatory patients. FDA clearance permits marketing in the US but does not 
      mean that the FDA has found the device to have clinical efficacy. Rather, clearance 
      means that EarlySense is equivalent to older devices in its ability to measure 
      respiration rate and heart rate. PREDICTING CLINICAL DETERIORATION: Research 
      conducted in the 1990s suggested that, among patients on general hospital wards, 
      delays in treatment can lead to clinical deterioration and changes in vital signs 
      and mental function that precede deterioration are often missed.. These observations 
      led to the development of “rapid response teams” (RRTs) that are activated when a 
      patient fulfills predefined criteria. The criteria are based on vital signs checks 
      and assessment of mental status. Some systems also include decreased urinary output, 
      oxygen saturation, difficulty breathing, increase in supplemental oxygen dose, and 
      subjective concern detected by the nurse at the bedside. The Early Warning Scoring 
      Systems (EWS), Modified EWS (MEWS), and the National EWS (NEWS) are commonly used 
      sets of criteria. These systems are widely used in VA. In addition to indicating 
      when to call the RRT, the systems also incorporate recommendations for the frequency 
      of bedside assessment. In 2014, a systematic review from the VA Evidence-based 
      Synthesis Program found that EWS/NEWS have strong predictive value for cardiac 
      arrest and patient death and their use increases RRT calls, but the impact of 
      EWS/NEWS on preventing patient mortality, transfers to the ICU, or length of 
      hospital stay is uncertain. The ability to predict which patients are most likely to 
      deteriorate has not been established. DeVita et al (2010) argue that while analyses 
      of cardiac arrests and deaths indicate that most are preceded by vital signs lying 
      outside normal ranges, most studies are retrospective, and because the total number 
      of clinical deteriorations has not been determined, the ability of physiological 
      abnormalities to predict risk of a serious event is unknown. Thus, in many 
      circumstances, clinicians cannot predict which patients are most likely to 
      deteriorate. In addition, lack of data prevents any estimate of how often severe 
      deterioration leads to clinically adverse outcomes. In a study examining the 
      association of delays in transfer to ICU, morbidity, and mortality, 11 physiological 
      and laboratory markers of clinical instability were observed as having high 
      sensitivity (88%) in identifying patients who were transferred to the ICU. These 
      markers, however, lacked specificity (13%) and had very low positive predictive 
      value (8%). This study suggests hospital staff cannot rely on markers alone to 
      identify patients most at risk of deterioration without using considerable resources 
      and incurring a high cost-benefit ratio. Because of the limitations in predicting 
      patients at highest risk of a serious event, the ability of intermittent or 
      continuous monitoring systems to detect severe physiological abnormalities in order 
      to provide a true estimate of risk or to determine optimum response triggering 
      values has not been fully established.,,,, Qualitative research suggests that 
      nurses' worry or concern often precedes deterioration in vital signs, suggesting 
      that better characterization of “concern” might lead to detection of deterioration 
      at an early stage when intervention to prevent adverse events may be more effective. 
      RATIONALE FOR CONTINUOUS VIAL SIGN MONITORING: The rationale for continuous vital 
      sign monitoring is that suboptimal vital sign monitoring prior to an RRT referral 
      may contribute to suboptimal patient outcomes. A more specific rationale for the 
      EarlySense monitoring system is that alerts based on vital sign trends rather than 
      just threshold parameters may add predictive ability to that of MEWS criteria and 
      lead to earlier, more effective RRT calls. On busy wards, the frequency and accuracy 
      of vital sign checks may be insufficient to detect deterioration, especially at 
      night. Factors that may contribute to suboptimal patient monitoring include adverse 
      working conditions, heavy workloads, lack of education and training, lack of 
      experience and failure to recognize clinical urgency, errors in calculating EWS, 
      communication deficits between doctors and nurses, cultural influences and 
      intra-professional hierarchies, and lack of compliance. WHAT ARE THE ALTERNATIVES TO 
      EARLYSENSE? Standard nurse-led monitoring in conjunction with EWS or MEWS is the 
      most commonly used alternative to continuous vital sign monitoring. Other low-acuity 
      systems are also alternatives to EarlySense. They are similar to EarlySense but 
      require leads attached to the patient, and some require cables to connect with the 
      display. All of these systems capture respiratory rate and heart rate, and some 
      capture blood pressure, oxygen saturation, temperature, and ECG. Most contribute 
      vital sign data directly to the electronic medical record. The market for low-acuity 
      monitoring systems is growing rapidly, leading to intense technological development. 
      Bedside monitors have sensors that are attached to the patient and connected via 
      cables or leads to a display panel near the patient's bed and on remote displays. 
      Manufacturers include Covidien, Masimo, Welch Allyn, and Zoe Medical. A major 
      assumption underlying EarlySense is that these systems may be less safe than a 
      contact-free low-acuity monitoring system because of cable management issues. 
      Wearable monitors have sensors that attach to a small, lightweight display unit that 
      enables monitoring even when the patient is out of bed. It is not known to what 
      extent the need for contacts is a disadvantage for nursing staff or for patients. 
      Few if any data are available about the use of these systems on general 
      medical-surgical wards. For example, a search by ECRI found no clinical trials of GE 
      Carescape or Nihon Kohden BSM-6000 bedside monitors. Philips and Sotera also 
      manufacture wearable monitor systems. Medium-acuity telemetry systems are widely 
      employed in the general medical and surgical wards. They are more expensive than 
      EarlySense. An example is Intellivue (Phillips). This system uses ECG leads (wires) 
      attached to the patient and to a small mobile device that fits into the patient's 
      pocket. It records cardiac waveforms so that heart rate and rhythm are easily 
      visualized. More expensive (and bulkier) models also monitor respiratory rate via 
      the telemetry leads. Like EarlySense, these systems provide alerts if any of the 
      parameters exceed predefined thresholds, which can be customized. Unlike EarlySense, 
      the wearable sensors can monitor the patient in or out of bed, enabling continuous 
      distant ECG monitoring. Continuous output can be viewed at the bedside and from a 
      central monitoring system and text alerts are provided to nurses on mobile devices. 
      The systems can analyze the ECG output to diagnose many cardiac arrhythmias. They 
      are often used in conjunction with pulse oximetry (oxygen saturation monitoring) 
      and, especially in post-operative patients, capnography.

TI  - Remote electrocardiographic monitoring with a wireless implantable loop recorder: 
      minimizing the data review burden.
PG  - 1347-52
LID - 10.1111/j.1540-8159.2010.02857.x [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Currently available implantable loop recorders (ILRs) are hampered by 
      limited memory, sensing artifacts, and need for manual memory download. Remote 
      monitoring techniques that automatically transfer stored recordings for review may 
      enhance ILR utility. However, automatic electrocardiograph (ECG) detection and 
      transmission of an excessive number of tracings directly to physicians may be 
      burdensome. This pilot study assessed the utility of direct ILR transmission to a 
      central ECG monitoring center on the burden of data to be reviewed by the physician. 
      METHODS: Patients with unexplained syncope were implanted with a novel ILR with 
      automatic (i.e., independent of patient intervention) wireless telemetry download. 
      Transmitted recordings underwent a two-step review process: initial algorithmic 
      filtering followed by human overread at a monitoring center using predefined 
      criteria. RESULTS: Forty patients were enrolled and followed for 8.5 ± 5.1 months. A 
      total of 223,226 ECG recordings were transmitted to the monitoring center (on 
      average 660 per patient per month). Algorithmic filtering eliminated 191,305 ECGs as 
      artifact (89%), with monitoring center overread of 31,921 strips. Ultimately, 117 
      relevant ECGs were selected for further evaluation by the physician (0.0053%). One 
      or more relevant ECGs were identified for 20 patients (50%). CONCLUSIONS: Automatic 
      ILR recording and wireless technique is feasible for remote ECG monitoring by ILRs. 
      However, sensitive criteria for recording and transmission may result in an 
      excessive ECG burden. The two-step screening process in this pilot study minimized 
      physician overread time while providing clinically relevant recordings in a 
      substantial proportion of patients.

TI  - Non-invasive ventilation outside of the Intensive Care Unit: an Italian survey.
PG  - 313-22
AB  - BACKGROUND: Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) is increasingly utilized for patients 
      with acute respiratory failure (ARF). The shortage of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) 
      beds, a growing confidence with the technique, and the opportunity to treat ARF in a 
      more responsive phase lead to the application of NIV outside of the ICU. The Study 
      Group on Emergency of the Italian Society of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation 
      and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) promoted a national survey to collect data on NIV use 
      outside of the ICU. METHODS: An anonymous questionnaire was developed, focusing on 
      the location and modalities of NIV treatments, organizational and technical aspects, 
      monitoring, estimated outcomes, the presence of protocols, and complications. The 
      questionnaire was mailed to all members of the Scientific Society. RESULTS: 
      Forty-six respondents were from 46 hospitals. Thirty-seven (80%) respondents applied 
      NIV in the Emergency Department and/or General Wards. In the majority of hospitals 
      (72%), training preceded NIV introduction. NIV could be applied in all ordinary 
      wards in 28% of the hospitals. Patients remained in their ward in 89% of the 
      hospitals, and a protocol was present in 70% of the hospitals. Monitoring was 
      usually limited to continuous pulse-oxymetry and EKG; 18% of respondents did not 
      have a monitoring standard. Reported complications and practical problems were 
      potentially severe. Few hospitals (15%) collected data on NIV treatments. The 
      efficacy of NIV was perceived as low, as 73% of respondents estimated that NIV 
      avoided tracheal intubation in less than half of the treated patients. CONCLUSION: 
      In Italy, NIV is extensively applied in non-intensive wards, and its use is not free 
      from criticalities and contradictions. Further prospective studies and possibly 
      guidelines are needed.

      Early-Stage Intensive Care Unit Nurses.
PG  - 174-180
LID - 10.3928/00220124-20200317-07 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Team-based learning (TBL) can be one way of improving professional and 
      practical skills for nurses. This study explored the effectiveness of an 
      electrocardiography training program using TBL for early-stage nurses in intensive 
      care units. METHOD: This study used a pretest-posttest nonequivalent control group. 
      A total of 65 participants were enrolled in the study (36 in the experimental group 
      and 29 in the control group). Participants in the experimental group were trained 
      with TBL, and participants in the control group had lecture-based learning on 
      electrocardiography education. RESULTS: There was no statistically significant 
      difference between the team-based and lecture-based learning groups after the 
      training in participants' knowledge of electrocardiography and reading ability of 
      bedside (lead II rhythm) electrocardiography monitoring (p > .05). However, there 
      was a statistically significant difference between the two groups in the reading 
      ability of the 12-lead electrocardiography (p < .001). CONCLUSION: TBL was more 
      effective in improving nurses' reading ability of the 12-lead electrocardiography.

TI  - A wavelet-based ECG delineation algorithm for 32-bit integer online processing.
PG  - 23
LID - 10.1186/1475-925X-10-23 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Since the first well-known electrocardiogram (ECG) delineator based on 
      Wavelet Transform (WT) presented by Li et al. in 1995, a significant research effort 
      has been devoted to the exploitation of this promising method. Its ability to 
      reliably delineate the major waveform components (mono- or bi-phasic P wave, QRS, 
      and mono- or bi-phasic T wave) would make it a suitable candidate for efficient 
      online processing of ambulatory ECG signals. Unfortunately, previous implementations 
      of this method adopt non-linear operators such as root mean square (RMS) or floating 
      point algebra, which are computationally demanding. METHODS: This paper presents a 
      32-bit integer, linear algebra advanced approach to online QRS detection and P-QRS-T 
      waves delineation of a single lead ECG signal, based on WT. RESULTS: The QRS 
      detector performance was validated on the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database (sensitivity 
      Se = 99.77%, positive predictive value P+ = 99.86%, on 109010 annotated beats) and 
      on the European ST-T Database (Se = 99.81%, P+ = 99.56%, on 788050 annotated beats). 
      The ECG delineator was validated on the QT Database, showing a mean error between 
      manual and automatic annotation below 1.5 samples for all fiducial points: P-onset, 
      P-peak, P-offset, QRS-onset, QRS-offset, T-peak, T-offset, and a mean standard 
      deviation comparable to other established methods. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed 
      algorithm exhibits reliable QRS detection as well as accurate ECG delineation, in 
      spite of a simple structure built on integer linear algebra.

TI  - Nonlinear analysis of continuous ECG during sleep I. Reconstruction.
PG  - 477-83
AB  - In recent years evidence has accumulated that ECG signals are of a nonlinear nature. 
      It has been recognized that strictly periodic cardiac rhythms are not accompanied by 
      healthy conditions but, on the contrary, by pathological states. Therefore, the 
      application of methods from nonlinear system theory for the analysis of ECG signals 
      has gained increasing interest. Crucial for the application of nonlinear methods is 
      the reconstruction (embedding) of the time series in a phase space with appropriate 
      dimension. In this study continuous ECG signals of 12 healthy subjects recorded 
      during different sleep stages were analysed. Proper embedding dimension was 
      determined by application of two techniques the false nearest neighbours method and 
      the saturation of the correlation dimension. Results for the ECG signals were 
      compared with findings for simulated data (quasiperiodic dynamics, Lorenz data, 
      white noise) and for phase randomized surrogates. Findings obtained with the two 
      approaches suggest that embedding dimensions from 6 to 8 may be regarded as suitable 
      for the topologically proper reconstruction of ECG signals.

TI  - Detection of false arrhythmia alarms with emphasis on ventricular tachycardia.
PG  - 1326-39
LID - 10.1088/0967-3334/37/8/1326 [doi]
AB  - Our approach to detecting false arrhythmia alarms in the intensive care unit breaks 
      down into several tasks. It involves beat detection on different signals: 
      electrocardiogram, photoplethysmogram and arterial blood pressure. The quality of 
      each channel has to be estimated in order to evaluate the reliability of obtained 
      beat detections. The information about the heart rate from the different channels 
      must be integrated in order to find a final conclusion. Some alarm types require 
      particular detectors as is the case of ventricular fibrillation. To identify false 
      ventricular tachycardia alarms we needed to classify heart beats as 
      normal/ventricular. For that purpose we introduce a new feature, QRS polarity type. 
      This feature was important in order to reduce misclassification of ventricular 
      beats: there was an improvement in the ventricular tachycardia alarm true positive 
      rate from 69% to 81%. However, the true negative rate was reduced from 95% to 69% 
      and our global challenge score (real-time event) dropped from 79.02 to 74.28. Our 
      challenge algorithm achieved the third best score in the 2015 PhysioNet/CinC 
      challenge event 1 (real time).

TI  - Ventricular ectopic beat detection using a wavelet transform and a convolutional 
      neural network.
PG  - 055002
LID - 10.1088/1361-6579/ab17f0 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Ventricular contractions in healthy individuals normally follow the 
      contractions of atria to facilitate more efficient pump action and cardiac output. 
      With a ventricular ectopic beat (VEB), volume within the ventricles are pumped to 
      the body's vessels before receiving blood from atria, thus causing inefficient blood 
      circulation. VEBs tend to cause perturbations in the instantaneous heart rate time 
      series, making the analysis of heart rate variability inappropriate around such 
      events, or requiring special treatment (such as signal averaging). Moreover, VEB 
      frequency can be indicative of life-threatening problems. However, VEBs can often 
      mimic artifacts both in morphology and timing. Identification of VEBs is therefore 
      an important unsolved problem. The aim of this study is to introduce a method of 
      wavelet transform in combination with deep learning network for the classification 
      of VEBs. APPROACH: We proposed a method to automatically discriminate VEB beats from 
      other beats and artifacts with the use of wavelet transform of the electrocardiogram 
      (ECG) and a convolutional neural network (CNN). Three types of wavelets (Morlet 
      wavelet, Paul wavelet and Gaussian derivative) were used to transform segments of 
      single-channel (1D) ECG waveforms to two-dimensional (2D) time-frequency 'images'. 
      The 2D time-frequency images were then passed into a CNN to optimize the 
      convolutional filters and classification. Ten-fold cross validation was used to 
      evaluate the approach on the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database (MIT-BIH). The American 
      Heart Association (AHA) database was then used as an independent dataset to evaluate 
      the trained network. MAIN RESULTS: Ten-fold cross validation results on MIT-BIH 
      showed that the proposed algorithm with Paul wavelet achieved an overall F1 score of 
      84.94% and accuracy of 97.96% on out of sample validation. Independent test on AHA 
      resulted in an F1 score of 84.96% and accuracy of 97.36%. SIGNIFICANCE: The trained 
      network possessed exceptional transferability across databases and generalization to 
      unseen data.

      reconstruction.

AB  - Three-dimensional reconstruction of cardiac vasculature from angiographic C-arm CT 
      (rotational angiography) data is a major challenge. Motion artefacts corrupt image 
      quality, reducing usability for diagnosis and guidance. Many state-of-the-art 
      approaches depend on retrospective ECG-gating of projection data for image 
      reconstruction. A trade-off has to be made regarding the size of the ECG-gating 
      window. A large temporal window is desirable to avoid undersampling. However, 
      residual motion will occur in a large window, causing motion artefacts. We present 
      an algorithm to correct for residual motion. Our approach is based on a deformable 
      2D-2D registration between the forward projection of an initial, ECG-gated 
      reconstruction, and the original projection data. The approach is fully automatic 
      and does not require any complex segmentation of vasculature, or landmarks. The 
      estimated motion is compensated for during the backprojection step of a subsequent 
      reconstruction. We evaluated the method using the publicly available CAVAREV 
      platform and on six human clinical datasets. We found a better visibility of 
      structure, reduced motion artefacts, and increased sharpness of the vessels in the 
      compensated reconstructions compared to the initial reconstructions. At the time of 
      writing, our algorithm outperforms the leading result of the CAVAREV ranking list. 
      For the clinical datasets, we found an average reduction of motion artefacts by 
      13 ± 6%. Vessel sharpness was improved by 25 ± 12% on average.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to define criteria suited to automated detection of 
      end QRS notching and slurring and to evaluate their accuracy. One hundred resting 12 
      lead ECGs from young adult men, split randomly into equal training and test sets, 
      were examined independently by two reviewers for the presence of such notching or 
      slurring. Consensus was reached by re-examination. Logic was added to the Glasgow 
      resting ECG program to automate the detection of the phenomenon. After training, the 
      automated detection had a sensitivity (SE) of 92.1% and a specificity (SP) of 96.6%. 
      For the test set, SE was 90.5%, SP 96.5%. Two populations of healthy subjects--one 
      Caucasian, one Nigerian--were analysed using the automated method. The prevalence of 
      notching/slurring with peak/onset amplitude respectively ≥ 0.1 mV in two contiguous 
      inferolateral leads was 23% and 29% respectively. In conclusion, the detection of 
      end QRS notching or slurring can be automated with a high degree of accuracy.

AB  - Cardiovascular disease is the first cause of death around the world. In 
      accomplishing quick and accurate diagnosis, automatic electrocardiogram (ECG) 
      analysis algorithm plays an important role, whose first step is QRS detection. The 
      threshold algorithm of QRS complex detection is known for its high-speed computation 
      and minimized memory storage. In this mobile era, threshold algorithm can be easily 
      transported into portable, wearable, and wireless ECG systems. However, the 
      detection rate of the threshold algorithm still calls for improvement. An improved 
      adaptive threshold algorithm for QRS detection is reported in this paper. The main 
      steps of this algorithm are preprocessing, peak finding, and adaptive threshold QRS 
      detecting. The detection rate is 99.41%, the sensitivity (Se) is 99.72%, and the 
      specificity (Sp) is 99.69% on the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia database. A comparison is also 
      made with two other algorithms, to prove our superiority. The suspicious abnormal 
      area is shown at the end of the algorithm and RR-Lorenz plot drawn for doctors and 
      cardiologists to use as aid for diagnosis.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The interval from J-point to T-wave peak (JTp) in ECG is a new 
      biomarker able to identify drugs that prolong the QT interval but have different ion 
      channel effects. If JTp is not prolonged, the prolonged QT may be associated with 
      multi ion channel block that may have low torsade de pointes risk. From the 
      automatic ECG measurement perspective, accurate and repeatable measurement of JTp 
      involves different challenges than QT. We evaluated algorithm performance and JTp 
      challenges using the Philips DXL diagnostic 12/16/18-lead algorithm. Measurement of 
      JTp represents a different use model. Standard use of corrected QT interval is 
      clinical risk assessment on patients with cardiac disease or suspicion of heart 
      disease. Drug safety trials involve a very different population - young healthy 
      subjects - who commonly have J-waves, notches and slurs. Drug effects include 
      difficult and unusual morphology such as flat T-waves, gentle notches, and multiple 
      T-wave peaks. METHODS: The JTp initiative study provided ECGs collected from 22 
      young subjects (11 males and females) in randomized testing of dofetilide, 
      quinidine, ranolazine, verapamil and placebo. We compare the JTp intervals between 
      DXL algorithm and the FDA published measurements. The lead wise, vector-magnitude 
      (VM), root-mean-square (RMS) and principal-component-analysis (PCA) representative 
      beats were used to measure JTp and QT intervals. We also implemented four different 
      methods for T peak detection for comparison. RESULTS: We found that JTp measurements 
      were closer to the reference for combined leads RMS and PCA than individual leads. 
      Differences in J-point location led to part of the JTp measurement difference 
      because of the high prevalence of J-waves, notches and slurs. Larger differences 
      were noted for drug effect causing multiple distinct T-wave peaks (Tp). The 
      automated algorithm chooses the later peak while the reference was the earlier peak. 
      Choosing among different algorithmic strategies in T peak measurement results in the 
      tradeoff between stability and the accurate detection of calcium or sodium channel 
      block. CONCLUSION: Measurement of JTp has different challenges than QT measurement. 
      JTp measurement accuracy improved with combined leads RMS and PCA over lead II or 
      V5.

      infarction].
PG  - 910-916
LID - 10.4268/cjcmm20160525 [doi]
AB  - Salvianolic acid A (SAA), one of the major active water-soluble salvianolic acids of 
      traditional Chinese medicine Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge, has been reported to be 
      effective on anti-myocardial ischemia, anti-oxidation and anti-thrombus. This study 
      aimed to investigate appropriate administration route on dogs with acute myocardial 
      ischemia(AMI). Twenty-four dogs were randomized into four groups (n=6), model, oral 
      administration of SAA (8 mg•kg⁻¹), intravenous administration of SAA (4 mg•kg⁻¹), 
      intravenous administration of Herbesser(0.5 mg•kg⁻¹) as positive drug group. AMI 
      model was established by ligating left anterior descending coronary arteries(LAD) of 
      dogs. Changes of ST segment were determined by epicardial electrocardiogram(ECG), 
      coronary blood flow (CBF) and myocardial oxygen consumption were measured by 
      ultrasonic Doppler flow meter, serum creatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase 
      (LDH) were observed by fully automatic biochemical analyser. Myocardial infarct size 
      was assessed by nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT) staining. Both oral and intravenous 
      administration of SAA reduced the myocardial infarct area/left ventricle area 
      significantly [(16.73±6.52)% and (13.19±2.38)%, compared with (24.35±4.89)% in model 
      group, P<0.01). Oral administration of SAA improved the ECG performance of Σ-ST from 
      30-190 min after ischemia (P<0.05-0.01), while intravenous SAA had a rapid onset 
      (10-190 min after ischemia, P<0.05-0.01). Compared with model group, oral and 
      intravenous SAA both decreased serum CK and LDH significantly (P<0.05-0.01), while 
      the difference of intravenous administration is more significant. SAA protects 
      myocardium in canine experimental myocardial infarction models. Intravenous 
      administration of SAA alleviates myocardial infarction with greater significance 
      than oral route.

TI  - Photoplethysmographic Waveform Versus Heart Rate Variability to Identify Low-Stress 
      States: Attention Test.
PG  - 1940-1951
LID - 10.1109/JBHI.2018.2882142 [doi]
AB  - Our long-term goal is the development of an automatic identifier of attentional 
      states. In order to accomplish it, we should first be able to identify different 
      states based on physiological signals. So, the first aim of this paper is to 
      identify the most appropriate features to detect a subject's high performance state. 
      For that, a database of electrocardiographic (ECG) and photoplethysmographic (PPG) 
      signals is recorded in two unequivocally defined states (rest and attention task) 
      from up to 50 subjects as a sample of the population. Time and frequency parameters 
      of heart/pulse rate variability have been computed from the ECG/PPG signals, 
      respectively. Additionally, the respiratory rate has been estimated from both 
      signals and also six morphological parameters from PPG. In total, 26 features are 
      obtained for each subject. They provide information about the autonomic nervous 
      system and the physiological response of the subject to an attention demand task. 
      Results show an increase of sympathetic activation when the subjects perform the 
      attention test. The amplitude and width of the PPG pulse were more sensitive than 
      the classical sympathetic markers ([Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text]) for 
      identifying this attentional state. State classification accuracy reaches a mean of 
      [Formula: see text], a maximum of [Formula: see text], and a minimum of 85%, in the 
      100 classifications made by only selecting four parameters extracted from the PPG 
      signal (pulse amplitude, pulsewidth, pulse downward slope, and mean pulse rate). 
      These results suggest that attentional states could be identified by PPG.

TI  - [Effect of electroacupuncture pre-treatment on myocardial enzyme levels in recurrent 
      myocardial ischemia rabbits].
PG  - 224-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of electroacupuncture (EA) preconditioning of 
      "Neiguan" (PC 6) on myocardial enzyme levels in acute recurrent myocardial ischemia 
      rabbits so as to study its mechanisms underlying protection of ischemic myocardium. 
      METHODS: A total of 40 healthy rabbits were randomized into normal control, 
      myocardial ischemia (MI) model, EA preconditioning (EA-P), recurrent MI (RMI), EA-P+ 
      RMI groups. MI model was duplicated by auricular intravenous administration of 
      Posterior Pituitary Injection (PPI, 0.3 mL/kg). EA (2 Hz/70 Hz, 2-4 mA) was applied 
      to bilateral PC 6 for 30 min, once daily for 7 d before MI. The contents of serum 
      aspartate aminotransferase (AST), isoenzymes of creatine kinase (CK-MB), lactate 
      dehydrogenase (LDH), creatine kinase (CK), alpha-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase 
      (alpha-HBD) were detected by automatic biochemistry analyzer. RESULTS: Following 
      administration of PPI, ECG-ST(II), serum AST, CK-MB, LDH, CK and alpha-HBD levels 
      were increased significantly in the MI and RMI groups (P<0.01). Compared with the MI 
      model group, ECG-ST(II), serum AST, CK-MB, LDH, CK and alpha-HBD levels were 
      down-regulated considerably in the EA-P group (P<0.01), and ECG-ST(II), serum AST, 
      CK-MB, LDH, CK and alpha-HBD levels were obviously lower in the EA-P+ RMI group than 
      in the RMI group (P<0.01). No significant differences were found between the MI and 
      RMI groups, and between EA-P and EA-P + RMI groups in the above-mentioned 6 indexes 
      (P>0.05). CONCLUSION: Electroacupuncture preconditioning has a remarkable effect in 
      the prevention of ischemic myocardial injury of both acute and recurrent myocardial 
      ischemia in the rabbit, which is closely associated with its functions in lowering 
      serum AST, CK-MB, LDH, CK and alpha-HBD contents.

TI  - Application of higher order cumulants to ECG signals for the cardiac health 
      diagnosis.
PG  - 1697-700
LID - 10.1109/IEMBS.2011.6090487 [doi]
AB  - Electrocardiogram (ECG) is the P-QRS-T wave which indicates the electrical activity 
      of the heart. The subtle changes in the amplitude and duration of the ECG signal 
      depict the cardiac abnormality. It is very difficult to decipher these minute 
      changes by the naked eye. Hence, a computer-aided diagnosis system will help the 
      physicians to monitor the cardiac health. The ECG is a nonlinear and non-stationary 
      signal. Hence, the hidden information in the ECG signal can be extracted using 
      nonlinear method. In this paper, we have automatically classified normal and 
      abnormal beats using higher order spectra (HOS) cumulants of wavelet packet 
      decomposition (WPD). The abnormal beats are ventricular premature contractions (VPC) 
      and Atrial premature contractions (APC). These HOS cumulant features of the WPD are 
      subjected to principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce the number of features to 
      five. Finally these features were fed to the support vector machine (SVM) with 
      kernel functions for automatic classification. In our work, we have obtained the 
      highest accuracy of 98.4% sensitivity and specificity of 98.9% and 98.0% 
      respectively with radial basis function (RBF) kernel function and Meyer's wavelet 
      (dmey) function. Our system is ready clinically to run on large amount of data sets.

TI  - Haemodynamic monitoring of morbidly obese intensive care unit patients.
PG  - 234-42
AB  - Because of technical and practical difficulties in relation to increased body size, 
      haemodynamic monitoring of morbidly obese critically ill patients (i.e. body mass 
      index &#8805;40 kg÷m2) may be challenging. Obese and non-obese patients are not so 
      different with respect to haemodynamic monitoring and goals. The critical care 
      physician, however, should be aware of the basic principles of the monitoring tools 
      used. The theoretical assumptions and calculations of these tools could be invalid 
      because of the high body weight and fat distribution. Although the method of 
      assessing haemodynamic data may be more complex in morbidly obese patients, its 
      interpretation should not be different from that in non-obese patients. Indeed, when 
      indexed for body surface area or (predicted) lean body mass, reliable haemodynamic 
      data are comparable etween obese and non-obese individuals.

TI  - Phase statistics approach to human ventricular fibrillation.
PG  - 051917
AB  - Ventricular fibrillation (VF) is known to be the most dangerous cardiac arrhythmia, 
      frequently leading to sudden cardiac death (SCD). During VF, cardiac output drops to 
      nil and, unless the fibrillation is promptly halted, death usually ensues within 
      minutes. While delivering life saving electrical shocks is a method of preventing 
      SCD, it has been recognized that some, though not many, VF episodes are 
      self-terminating, and understanding the mechanism of spontaneous defibrillation 
      might provide newer therapeutic options for treatment of this otherwise fatal 
      arrhythmia. Using the phase statistics approach, recently developed to study 
      financial and physiological time series, here, we reveal the timing characteristics 
      of transient features of ventricular tachyarrhythmia (mostly VF) electrocardiogram 
      (ECG) and find that there are three distinct types of probability density function 
      (PDF) of phase distributions: uniform (UF), concave (CC), and convex (CV). Our data 
      show that VF patients with UF or CC types of PDF have approximately the same 
      probability of survival and nonsurvival, while VF patients with CV type PDF have 
      zero probability of survival, implying that their VF episodes are never 
      self-terminating. Our results suggest that detailed phase statistics of human ECG 
      data may be a key to understanding the mechanism of spontaneous defibrillation of 
      fatal VF.

TI  - Image quality and radiation dose of different scanning protocols in DSCT 
      cardiothoracic angiography for children with tetralogy of fallot.
LID - 10.1007/s10554-020-01882-w [doi]
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the image quality and radiation dose of 
      different scanning protocols in dual-source CT cardiothoracic angiography for 
      children with tetralogy of Fallot (TOF). Seventy-five consecutive children with 
      known or suspected TOF were enrolled to undergo prospective ECG-triggering 
      sequential dual-source CT (DSCT) cardiothoracic angiography. According to the 
      scanning protocols, these patients were randomly divided into 3 groups: fixed delay 
      time (FDT, n = 25, group A), automatic bolus-tracking (ABT, n = 25, group B) and 
      manual bolus-tracking (MBT, n = 25, group C). Subjective and objective image quality 
      were evaluated. The radiation doses were recorded. The image quality scores of group 
      C were significantly higher than those of group A and B. The absolute value of 
      difference (D-value) on CT attenuation between left (CT(LV)) and right ventricle 
      (CT(RV)) in group C was significantly lower than that in group A and B. The total 
      effective dose of groups A, B and C were 0.39 ± 0.06 mSv, 0.40 ± 0.07 mSv and 
      0.40 ± 0.08 mSv, respectively. There was no significant difference among 3 groups 
      (P = 0.722). Scanning protocol has significantly impacts on the image quality of 
      cardiovascular structures for TOF patients. Compared with the conventional scanning 
      protocols FDT and ABT, the MBT technique provides high image quality and achieves 
      more homogenous attenuation among different patients with TOF.

TI  - Cardiovascular disease diagnosis using cross-domain transfer learning.
PG  - 4262-4265
LID - 10.1109/EMBC.2019.8857737 [doi]
AB  - While cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are commonly diagnosed by cardiologists via 
      inspecting electrocardiogram (ECG) waveforms, these decisions can be supported by a 
      data-driven approach, which may automate this process. An automatic diagnostic 
      approach often employs hand-crafted features extracted from ECG waveforms. These 
      features, however, do not generalise well, challenged by variation in acquisition 
      settings such as sampling rate and mounting points. Existing deep learning (DL) 
      approaches, on the other hand, extract features from ECG automatically but require 
      construction of dedicated networks that require huge data and computational resource 
      if trained from scratch. Here we propose an end-to-end trainable cross-domain 
      transfer learning for CVD classification from ECG waveforms, by utilising existing 
      vision-based CNN frameworks as feature extractors, followed by ECG feature learning 
      layers. Because these frameworks are designed for image inputs, we employ a stacked 
      spectrogram representation of multi-lead ECG waveforms as a preprocessing step. We 
      also proposed a fusion of multiple ECG leads, using plausible stacking arrangements 
      of the spectrograms, to encode their spatial relations. The proposed approach is 
      validated on multiple ECG datasets and competitive performance is achieved.

TI  - Automatic detection of chest compressions for the assessment of CPR-quality 
      parameters.

LID - 10.1016/j.resuscitation.2014.04.007 [doi]
AB  - AIM: Accurate chest compression detection is key to evaluate cardiopulmonary 
      resuscitation (CPR) quality. Two automatic compression detectors were developed, for 
      the compression depth (CD), and for the thoracic impedance (TI). The objective was 
      to evaluate their accuracy for compression detection and for CPR quality assessment. 
      METHODS: Compressions were manually annotated using the force and ECG in 38 
      out-of-hospital resuscitation episodes, comprising 869 min and 67,402 compressions. 
      Compressions were detected using a negative peak detector for the CD. For the TI, an 
      adaptive peak detector based on the amplitude and duration of TI fluctuations was 
      used. Chest compression rate (CC-rate) and chest compression fraction (CCF) were 
      calculated for the episodes and for every minute within each episode. CC-rate for 
      rescuer feedback was calculated every 8 consecutive compressions. RESULTS: The 
      sensitivity and positive predictive value were 98.4% and 99.8% using CD, and 94.2% 
      and 97.4% using TI. The mean CCF and CC-rate obtained from both detectors showed no 
      significant differences with those obtained from the annotations (P>0.6). The 
      Bland-Altman analysis showed acceptable 95% limits of agreement between the 
      annotations and the detectors for the per-minute CCF, per-minute CC-rate, and 
      CC-rate for feedback. For the detector based on TI, only 3.7% of CC-rate feedbacks 
      had an error larger than 5%. CONCLUSION: Automatic compression detectors based on 
      the CD and TI signals are very accurate. In most cases, episode review could safely 
      rely on these detectors without resorting to manual review. Automatic feedback on 
      rate can be accurately done using the impedance channel.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine and compare HRV parameters in poorly and well 
      controlled type 2 diabetes. 54 normotensive type 2 diabetes patients without 
      clinical signs of CAN were enrolled; 29 poorly controlled (HbA1c ≥ 7%) and 25 
      controls matched for age, sex and BMI. HRV analysis was performed using 24-h 
      ambulatory ECG, with automatic estimation of the time and frequency domain ranges. 
      Comparisons were performed using Mann-Whitney test. RESULTS: We included 54 
      participants (26 males) aged 56 years [43-62], with known duration of diabetes 
      3 years [1-7]. HbA1c was 10.1% [9.1-11.9] vs 5.3% [5.1-6.3] (p < 0.001). Blood 
      pressure was 126 mmHg [121-130] vs 124 mmHg [113-133] in the poorly controlled group 
      and the well-controlled group respectively (p = 0.5). 24-h mean heart rate was 
      significantly higher in poorly controlled vs well controlled patients (79 bpm 
      [77-83] vs 75 bpm [69-79], p = 0.006). In the time domain analysis, markers of the 
      overall variability were lower and thus altered in the poorly controlled group 
      (SDNN: 102 ms [90.5-111.1] vs 112.3 ms [104.4-131.2], p = 0.01 and SDANN 88 ms 
      [72.9-99.7] vs 97.8 ms [91.8-114.5], p = 0.01). The frequency domain analysis showed 
      trends towards lower values of sympathovagal balance markers in the poorly 
      controlled group. Reduced HRV is associated with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes 
      mellitus and may be an early marker in clinical practice.

AB  - Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common heart arrhythmia, and 12-lead 
      electrocardiogram (ECG) is regarded as the gold standard for AF diagnosis. Highly 
      accurate diagnosis of AF based on 12-lead ECG is valuable and remains challenging. 
      In this paper, we proposed a novel method with high accuracy for AF detection based 
      on deep learning. The proposed method constructed a novel one-dimensional deep 
      densely connected neural network (DDNN) to detect AF in ECG waveforms with a length 
      of 10s. A large set of 16,557 12-lead ECG recordings collected from multiple 
      hospitals and wearable ECG devices were used to evaluate the performance of the 
      DDNN. In the test dataset (3312 12-lead ECG recordings), the DDNN obtained high 
      performance with an accuracy of 99.35 ± 0.26%, a sensitivity of 99.19 ± 0.31%, and a 
      specificity of 99.44 ± 0.17%. Its high performance and automatic nature both 
      demonstrate that the proposed network has a great potential to be applied to 
      clinical computer-aided diagnosis of AF or future screening of AF in wearable 
      devices.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to develop an automated detection method, for prescreening 
      purposes, of early repolarization (ER) pattern with slur/notch configuration in 
      electrocardiogram (ECG) signals using a waveform prototype-based feature vector for 
      supervised classification. APPROACH: The feature vectors consist of fragments of the 
      ECG signal where the ER pattern is located, instead of abstract descriptive 
      variables of ECG waveforms. The tested classifiers included linear discriminant 
      analysis, k-nearest neighbor algorithm, and support vector machine (SVM). MAIN 
      RESULTS: SVM showed the best performance in Friedman tests in our test data 
      including 5676 subjects representing 45 408 leads. Accuracies of the different 
      classifiers showed results well over 90%, indicating that the waveform 
      prototype-based feature vector is an effective representation of the differences 
      between ECG signals with and without the ER pattern. The accuracy of inferior ER was 
      92.74% and 92.21% for lateral ER. The sensitivity achieved was 91.80% and 
      specificity was 92.73%. SIGNIFICANCE: The algorithm presented here showed good 
      performance results, indicating that it could be used as a prescreening tool of ER, 
      and it provides an additional identification of critical cases based on the 
      distances to the classifier decision boundary, which are close to the 0.1 mV 
      threshold and are difficult to label.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Seizure-related modulation of heart rate (HR) was examined extensively in 
      previous studies. However, the overall effect on HR attributable to epileptic 
      seizures is difficult to determine, given the considerable fluctuations of HR before 
      and during seizures. Here, we developed a semi-automatic procedure allowing 
      quantification of the total impact of seizures on HR and determination of temporal 
      relationships between seizure onset assessed by intracranial EEG (iEEG) and ECG. 
      METHODS: ECG and iEEG data of epilepsy patients undergoing video-EEG telemetry for 
      epilepsy surgery with bilateral hippocampal depth electrodes were analysed 
      retrospectively. Consecutive RR intervals and HR profiles were determined using R 
      detection algorithms. Novel features including the normalized ictal area under the 
      curve (niAUC), as well as the time point of ECG onset (HR breakpoint) were 
      calculated. Selected HR features were compared to widely-used manually acquired 
      measures. Data are given as median ± SD. RESULTS: Fifteen patients had a total of 34 
      seizures with left-hippocampal and 37 seizures with right-hippocampal onset. HR 
      increased by 9 ± 19% during seizures. Latency between iEEG seizure-onset to the HR 
      breakpoint was 23 ± 22 s. No significant difference between left- and 
      right-hippocampal seizures was observed with respect to HR increases, latencies and 
      niAUC. A comparison between results of the semi-automatic and manual approach 
      revealed that ictal HR changes showed a higher correlation (r = 0.6) than niAUC 
      (r = 0.4). CONCLUSIONS: The proposed semi-automatic approach to analyze continuous 
      HR data provides useful tools for estimating the overall effect of seizures on HR in 
      greater detail. Our results suggest that the side of hippocampal seizure onset has 
      no significant effect on the latency and extent of ictal HR changes. The algorithms 
      may be of further use in clinical research and the development of seizure detection 
      devices.

TI  - Tensor-based detection of T wave alternans using ECG.
PG  - 6991-4
LID - 10.1109/EMBC.2015.7320001 [doi]
AB  - T wave alternans is defined as changes in the T wave amplitude in an ABABAB-pattern. 
      It can be found in ECG signals of patients with heart diseases and is a possible 
      indicator to predict the risk on sudden cardiac death. Due to its low amplitude, 
      robust automatic T wave alternans detection is a difficult task. We present a new 
      method to detect T wave alternans in multichannel ECG signals. The use of tensors 
      (multidimensional matrices) permits the combination of the information present in 
      different channels, making detection more reliable. The possibility of decomposition 
      of incomplete tensors is exploited to deal with noisy ECG segments. Using a sliding 
      window of 128 heartbeats, a tensor is constructed of the T waves of all channels. 
      Canonical Polyadic Decomposition is applied to this tensor and the resulting loading 
      vectors are examined for information about the T wave behavior in three dimensions. 
      T wave alternans is detected using a sign change counting method that is able to 
      extract both the T wave alternans length and magnitude. When applying this novel 
      method to a database of patients with multiple positive T wave alternans tests using 
      the clinically available spectral method tests, both the length and the magnitude of 
      the detected T wave alternans is larger for these subjects than for subjects in a 
      control group.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Prehospital electrocardiography (PH ECG) is becoming the standard of 
      care for patients activating Emergency Medical Services for symptoms of acute 
      coronary syndrome (ACS). Little is known about the prognostic value of ischemia 
      found on PH ECG. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine whether 
      manifestations of acute myocardial ischemia on PH ECG are predictive of adverse 
      hospital outcomes. METHODS: This study was a retrospective analysis of all PH ECGs 
      recorded in 630 patients who called 911 for symptoms of ACS and were enrolled in a 
      prospective clinical trial. ST-segment monitoring software was added to the PH ECG 
      device with automatic storage and transmission of ECGs to the destination Emergency 
      Department. Patient medical records were reviewed for adverse hospital outcomes. 
      RESULTS: In 630 patients who called 911 for ACS symptoms, 270 (42.9%) had PH ECG 
      evidence of ischemia. Overall, 37% of patients with PH ECG ischemia had adverse 
      hospital outcomes compared with 27% of patients without PH ECG ischemia (p < 0.05). 
      Those with PH ECG ischemia were 1.55 times more likely to have adverse hospital 
      outcomes than those without PH ECG ischemia (95% CI 1.09-2.21; p < 0.05), after 
      controlling for other predictors of adverse hospital outcomes (i.e., age, sex, and 
      medical history). CONCLUSIONS: Evidence of ischemia on PH ECG is an independent 
      predictor of adverse hospital outcomes. ST-segment monitoring in the prehospital 
      setting can identify high-risk patients with symptoms of ACS and provide important 
      prognostic information at presentation to the Emergency Department.

LID - 10.2463/mrms.2013-0127 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: We evaluated the usefulness of an automatic slice-alignment method to 
      simplify planning of cardiac magnetic resonance (MR) scans with a 3-tesla scanner. 
      METHODS: We obtained 2-dimensional (2D) axial multislice images using steady-state 
      free precession (SSFP) sequences covering the whole heart at the end-diastole phase 
      with electrocardiography (ECG) gating in 38 patients. We detected several anatomical 
      feature points of the heart and calculated all planes required for cardiac imaging 
      based on those points. We visually evaluated the acceptability of an acquired 
      imaging plane and measured the angular differences of each view between the results 
      obtained by this method and by a conventional manual pointing approach. RESULTS: The 
      average visual scores were 3.4 ± 1.0 for short-axis images, 3.2 ± 0.9 for 4-chamber 
      images, 3.2 ± 0.8 for 2-chamber images, and 3.3 ± 0.8 for 3-chamber images; average 
      angular differences were 5.8 ± 5.1 (short axis), 7.7 ± 5.7 (4-chamber), 11.5 ± 6.7 
      (2-chamber), and 9.1 ± 4.6 degrees (3-chamber). Processing time was within 1.8 s in 
      all subjects. CONCLUSION: The proposed method can provide planes within the 
      clinically acceptable range and within a short time in cardiac imaging of patients 
      with various cardiac shapes and diseases without the need for high level operator 
      proficiency in performing the examination and interpreting results.

TI  - Role of Ultrasound in Evaluation of Undifferentiated Shock in ICU Settings.
PG  - 17-13
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To classify shock, using ultrasonography as the modality of choice for 
      imaging and to assess the diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound as a tool to classify 
      shock. DESIGN: Prospective study. SETTING: KEM Hospital, Pune in the ICU (Intensive 
      care unit). STUDY POPULATION: 100 patients admitted to the ICU with undifferentiated 
      shock. METHODS: Bedside ultrasound examination was performed within 1 hour of 
      admission to the ICU. These patients were also evaluated clinically and 
      biochemically to confirm the type of shock. All patients immediately received 
      standard diagnostic emergent interventions including physical examination, 
      intravenous access for whole blood assays, arterial gas analysis, 
      electrocardiography, continuous cardiac monitoring, supplemental oxygen and chest 
      radiograph. Clinical parameters, urine output, ECG and biochemical tests were 
      performed within 12 hours of USG. Additional investigations were performed wherever 
      required. The ultrasonographic diagnoses were compared with the respective final 
      clinical diagnoses by employing the Cohen kappa inter-rater coefficient of 
      agreement. In addition, various ultrasound parameters were also analyzed to assess 
      the best predictors for each type of shock. RESULTS: The ultrasound diagnosis showed 
      an overall good agreement (Cohen's kappa coefficient > or = 0.6) with the final 
      clinical diagnosis, in identifying the type of shock, in the emergency setting, when 
      ultrasound was done within 1 hour after admission to the ICU. In our study, 
      ultrasound showed maximum sensitivity, specificity, negative and positive predictive 
      values in the setting of obstructive shock. In addition, perfect agreement was seen 
      between the ultrasound and clinical diagnosis, with a Cohen kappa coefficient of 1 
      in obstructive shock. The least sensitivity, specificity, negative and positive 
      predictive values of ultrasound were seen in the setting of distributive shock. 
      Least agreement between the ultrasound and clinical diagnosis was also seen in 
      distributive shock, as most ultrasound findings were found to overlap with those in 
      the other types of shock. (Cohen kappa coefficient of 0.6). CONCLUSION: 
      Ultrasonography carried out within 1 hour of admission to the ICU plays a major role 
      in correct diagnosis of the type of shock and subsequent patient management. The 
      best ultrasonographic predictors for diagnosis of each type of shock, can help the 
      clinician to start timely specific interventions in critical care settings for each 
      type of shock.

TI  - SmartHypnos: Developing a Toolbox for Polysomnographic Data Visualization and 
      Analysis().
PG  - 1395-1398
LID - 10.1109/EMBC.2019.8857416 [doi]
AB  - In this paper we present the first steps in developing SmartHypnos, an easy to use 
      and user friendly graphical user interface, which aims to provide polysomngographic 
      data visualization and the detection and classification of sleep related events. 
      Currently SmartHypnos supports the visualization of EEG, ECG, EOG and EMG signals, 
      and respiratory signals such as nasal pressure, thermistor, oxygen saturation, 
      thoracic and abdominal belt recordings. All these are incorporated into an interface 
      that provides quick and effortless access to the signals mentioned above. The 
      interface displays automatic sleep staging capabilities as well as the detection of 
      apnea events with accuracy rates surpassing 80%. It is expected that SmartHypnos 
      will reduce the time required to analyze sleep data and also reduce possible human 
      errors.

PG  - 4108720
LID - 10.1155/2017/4108720 [doi]
LID - 4108720
AB  - Heartbeat classification is a crucial step for arrhythmia diagnosis during 
      electrocardiographic (ECG) analysis. The new scenario of wireless body sensor 
      network- (WBSN-) enabled ECG monitoring puts forward a higher-level demand for this 
      traditional ECG analysis task. Previously reported methods mainly addressed this 
      requirement with the applications of a shallow structured classifier and 
      expert-designed features. In this study, modified frequency slice wavelet transform 
      (MFSWT) was firstly employed to produce the time-frequency image for heartbeat 
      signal. Then the deep learning (DL) method was performed for the heartbeat 
      classification. Here, we proposed a novel model incorporating automatic feature 
      abstraction and a deep neural network (DNN) classifier. Features were automatically 
      abstracted by the stacked denoising auto-encoder (SDA) from the transferred 
      time-frequency image. DNN classifier was constructed by an encoder layer of SDA and 
      a softmax layer. In addition, a deterministic patient-specific heartbeat classifier 
      was achieved by fine-tuning on heartbeat samples, which included a small subset of 
      individual samples. The performance of the proposed model was evaluated on the 
      MIT-BIH arrhythmia database. Results showed that an overall accuracy of 97.5% was 
      achieved using the proposed model, confirming that the proposed DNN model is a 
      powerful tool for heartbeat pattern recognition.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study investigated sensitivity and false detection rate of a 
      multimodal automatic seizure detection algorithm and the applicability to reduced 
      electrode montages for long-term seizure documentation in epilepsy patients. 
      METHODS: An automatic seizure detection algorithm based on EEG, EMG, and ECG signals 
      was developed. EEG/ECG recordings of 92 patients from two epilepsy monitoring units 
      including 494 seizures were used to assess detection performance. EMG data were 
      extracted by bandpass filtering of EEG signals. Sensitivity and false detection rate 
      were evaluated for each signal modality and for reduced electrode montages. RESULTS: 
      All focal seizures evolving to bilateral tonic-clonic (BTCS, n=50) and 89% of focal 
      seizures (FS, n=139) were detected. Average sensitivity in temporal lobe epilepsy 
      (TLE) patients was 94% and 74% in extratemporal lobe epilepsy (XTLE) patients. 
      Overall detection sensitivity was 86%. Average false detection rate was 12.8 false 
      detections in 24h (FD/24h) for TLE and 22 FD/24h in XTLE patients. Utilization of 8 
      frontal and temporal electrodes reduced average sensitivity from 86% to 81%. 
      CONCLUSION: Our automatic multimodal seizure detection algorithm shows high 
      sensitivity with full and reduced electrode montages. SIGNIFICANCE: Evaluation of 
      different signal modalities and electrode montages paces the way for semi-automatic 
      seizure documentation systems.

TI  - Multi-arrhythmias detection with an XML rule-based system from 12-Lead 
      Electrocardiogram.
PG  - 4357-4363
LID - 10.19082/4357 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The computer-aided detection of cardiac arrhythmias stills a crucial 
      application in medical technologies. The rule based systems RBS ensure a high level 
      of transparency and interpretability of the obtained results. AIM: To facilitate the 
      diagnosis of the cardiologists and to reduce the uncertainty made in this diagnosis. 
      METHODS: In this research article, we have realized a classification and automatic 
      recognition of cardiac arrhythmias, by using XML rules that represent the 
      cardiologist knowledge. Thirteen experiments with different knowledge bases were 
      realized for improving the performance of the used method in the detection of 13 
      cardiac arrhythmias. In the first 12 experiments, we have designed a specialized 
      knowledge base for each cardiac arrhythmia, which contains just one arrhythmia 
      detection rule. In the last experiment, we applied the knowledge base which contains 
      rules of 12 arrhythmias. We used, for the experiments, an international data set 
      with 279 features and 452 records characterizing 12 leads of ECG signal and social 
      information of patients. The data sets were constructed and published at Bilkent 
      University of Ankara, Turkey. In addition, the second version of the self-developed 
      software "XMLRULE" was used; the software can infer more than one class and 
      facilitate the interpretability of the obtained results. RESULTS: The 12 first 
      experiments give 82.80% of correct detection as the mean of all experiments, the 
      results were between 19% and 100% with a low rate in just one experiment. The last 
      experiment in which all arrhythmias are considered, the results of correct detection 
      was 38.33% with 90.55% of sensibility and 46.24% of specificity. It was clearly show 
      that in these results the good choice of the classification model is very beneficial 
      in terms of performance. The obtained results were better than the published results 
      with other computational methods for the mono class detection, but it was less in 
      multi-class detection. CONCLUSION: The RBS is the most transparent method for 
      cardiac arrhythmias detection and multi arrhythmias detection. It improves an 
      exceptional recognition of arrhythmias, but due to conflicts between rules, 
      multi-arrhythmias and uncertainty of measures, the rate of correct classification 
      was less than the other methods.

      fibrillation (AF) ablation and its relation to reported symptoms. BACKGROUND: The 
      implantable loop recorder (ILR) continuously records the electrocardiogram (ECG), 
      has an automatic AF detection algorithm, and has a possibility for patients to 
      activate an ECG recording during symptoms. METHODS: Fifty-seven patients (mean age 
      57 ± 9 years, 60% male, 88% paroxysmal AF) underwent AF ablation following ILR 
      implantation. Device data were downloaded at the ablation and three, six, 12, 18, 
      and 24 months after ablation. RESULTS: Fifty-four patients completed the two-year 
      follow-up. Thirteen (24%) patients had no AF episodes detected by ILR during 
      follow-up. Ten of 41 patients (24%) with AF recurrence were only detected by ILR and 
      AF recurrences were detected earlier by ILR (P < 0.001). The median AF burden in 
      patients with AF recurrence was 5.7% (interquartile range 0.4-14.4) and was even 
      lower in patients with AF only detected by ILR (P = 0.001). Forty-eight % of the 
      patients indicated symptoms via the patient activator but 33% of those recordings 
      were not due to AF. Early AF recurrence (within 3 months) was highly associated with 
      later AF recurrence (P < 0.001). AF burden >0.5% and longest AF episode >6 hours 
      before the ablation were independent predictors of AF recurrence during intermittent 
      but not continuous monitoring. CONCLUSIONS: After AF ablation, the AF burden was low 
      throughout the 24 months follow-up. Nevertheless, symptoms were commonly indicated 
      but one-third of patient-activated recordings did not show AF. Continuous monitoring 
      was superior to intermittent follow-up in detecting AF episodes and assessing the AF 
      burden.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The first-order high-pass filter (AC coupling) has 
      previously been shown to affect the ECG for higher cut-off frequencies. We seek to 
      find a systematic deviation in computer measurements of the electrocardiogram when 
      the AC coupling with a 0.05 Hz first-order high-pass filter is used. METHODS: The 
      standard 12-lead electrocardiogram from 1248 patients and the automated measurements 
      of their DC and AC coupled version were used. We expect a large unipolar QRS-complex 
      to produce a deviation in the opposite direction in the ST-segment. RESULTS: We 
      found a strong correlation between the QRS integral and the offset throughout the 
      ST-segment. The coefficient for J amplitude deviation was found to be 
      -0.277 µV/(µV⋅s). CONCLUSIONS: Potential dangerous alterations to the diagnostically 
      important ST-segment were found. Medical professionals and software developers for 
      electrocardiogram interpretation programs should be aware of such high-pass filter 
      effects since they could be misinterpreted as pathophysiology or some 
      pathophysiology could be masked by these effects.

AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this research was to investigate the effects of exercise 
      capacity, heart rate recovery and heart rate variability after high-intensity 
      exercise on caffeine concentration of energy drink. METHODS: The volunteers for this 
      study were 15 male university student. 15 subjects were taken basic physical 
      examinations such as height, weight and BMI before the experiment. Primary tests 
      were examined of VO2max per weight of each subjects by graded exercise test using 
      Bruce protocol. Each of five subject was divided 3 groups (CON, ECGⅠ, ECGⅡ) by 
      matched method based on weight and VO2max per weight what gained of primary test for 
      minimize the differences of exercise capacity and ingestion of each groups. For the 
      secondary tests, the groups of subjects were taken their materials before and after 
      exercise as a blind test. After the ingestion, subjects were experimented on 
      exercise test of VO2max 80% by treadmill until the all-out. Heart rate was measured 
      by 1minute interval, and respiratory variables were analyzed VO2, VE, VT, RR and so 
      on by automatic respiratory analyzer. And exercise exhaustion time was determined by 
      stopwatch. Moreover, HRV was measured after exercise and recovery 3 min. RESULTS: 
      Among the intake groups, ECGⅡ was showed the longest of exercise exhaustion time 
      more than CON group (p = .05). Result of heart rate during exercise according to 
      intake groups, there was significant differences of each time (p < .001), however, 
      not significant differences of each groups and group verse time (p > .05). Result of 
      RPE during exercise according to intake groups, there was significant differences of 
      each time (p < .001), however, not significant differences of each groups and group 
      verse time (p > .05). CONCLUSION: In conclusion, EDGⅡ showed the significant 
      increase of exercise exhaustion time more than CON group (p=.05) and not significant 
      differences in HR, RPE, RER, HRV, HRR, blood pressure (p > .05). Therefore, 2.5 
      mg/kg(-1) ingestion of energy drink might be positive effect to increase exercise 
      performance capacity without side-effect in cardiovascular disease.

TI  - An incremental learning system for atrial fibrillation detection based on transfer 
      learning and active learning.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a type of arrhythmia with high 
      incidence. Automatic AF detection methods have been studied in previous works. 
      However, a model cannot be used all the time without any improvement. And updating 
      model requires adequate data and cost. Therefore, this study aims at finding a 
      low-cost way to choose learning samples and developing an incremental learning 
      system for AF detection. METHODS: Based on transfer learning and active learning, 
      this paper proposed a loop-locked framework integrating AF diagnose, label query, 
      and model fine-tuning. In the pre-training stage, a novel multiple-input deep neural 
      network (MIDNN) is pre-trained using labeled samples from an original training set. 
      In practical application, the model can be used for AF detection. Meanwhile, 
      continuous data is collected to form the candidate set. In the incremental learning 
      stage, the model was fine-tuned continuously by the most informative samples in the 
      candidate set. These samples are selected from the candidate set based on the 
      pre-trained model and a new active learning strategy. The strategy combines the 
      features and the uncertainty of the predicted results. RESULTS: In order to evaluate 
      the method, the MIT-BIH atrial fibrillation database was used for pre-training and 
      samples of the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database were taken as candidate set. The initial 
      values of Acc, Sen, and PPV were 87.40%, 97.46%, and 81.11%. These indexes reached 
      to the top values of 97.53%, 100.00%, and 95.29% after 14 iterations. Hence, the 
      number of queries was saved by 90.67%. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed system is able to 
      update the model continuously and reduce the labeling cost over 90%. The comparisons 
      demonstrated the effectiveness of MIDNN model and the suitability of novel learning 
      strategy for AF. Moreover, this framework can be extended to other biomedical 
      applications.

TI  - Use of self-gated radial cardiovascular magnetic resonance to detect and classify 
      arrhythmias (atrial fibrillation and premature ventricular contraction).
PG  - 83
LID - 83
AB  - BACKGROUND: Arrhythmia can significantly alter the image quality of cardiovascular 
      magnetic resonance (CMR); automatic detection and sorting of the most frequent types 
      of arrhythmias during the CMR acquisition could potentially improve image quality. 
      New CMR techniques, such as non-Cartesian CMR, can allow self-gating: from cardiac 
      motion-related signal changes, we can detect cardiac cycles without an 
      electrocardiogram. We can further use this data to obtain a surrogate for RR 
      intervals (valley intervals: VV). Our purpose was to evaluate the feasibility of an 
      automated method for classification of non-arrhythmic (NA) (regular cycles) and 
      arrhythmic patients (A) (irregular cycles), and for sorting of common arrhythmia 
      patterns between atrial fibrillation (AF) and premature ventricular contraction 
      (PVC), using the cardiac motion-related signal obtained during self-gated 
      free-breathing radial cardiac cine CMR with compressed sensing reconstruction 
      (XD-GRASP). METHODS: One hundred eleven patients underwent cardiac XD-GRASP CMR 
      between October 2015 and February 2016; 33 were included for retrospective analysis 
      with the proposed method (6 AF, 8 PVC, 19 NA; by recent ECG). We analyzed the VV, 
      using pooled statistics (histograms) and sequential analysis (Poincaré plots), 
      including the median (medVV), the weighted mean (meanVV), the total number of VV 
      values (VVval), and the total range (VVTR) and half range (VVHR) of the cumulative 
      frequency distribution of VV, including the median to half range (medVV/VVHR) and 
      the half range to total range (VVHR/VVTR) ratios. We designed a simple algorithm for 
      using the VV results to differentiate A from NA, and AF from PVC. RESULTS: Between 
      NA and A, meanVV, VVval, VVTR, VVHR, medVV/VVHR and VVHR/VVTR ratios were 
      significantly different (p values = 0.00014, 0.0027, 0.000028, 5×10(-9), 0.002, 
      respectively). Between AF and PVC, meanVV, VVval and medVV/VVHR ratio were 
      significantly different (p values = 0.018, 0.007, 0.044, respectively). Using our 
      algorithm, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 93 %, 95 % and 94 % to 
      discriminate between NA and A, and 83 %, 71 %, and 77 % to discriminate between AF 
      and PVC, respectively; areas under the ROC curve were 0.93 and 0.89. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Our study shows we can reliably detect arrhythmias and differentiate AF from PVC, 
      using self-gated cardiac cine XD-GRASP CMR.

TI  - Electrocardiographic predictors of pacemaker battery depletion: Diagnostic 
      sensitivity, specificity, and clinical risk.
PG  - 2-9
LID - 10.1111/pace.13831 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pacemaker battery depletion triggers alert for replacement notification 
      and results in automatic reprogramming, which has been shown to be associated with 
      relevant cardiorespiratory symptoms and adverse clinical events. OBJECTIVE: 
      Determine if electrocardiogram (ECG) pacing features may be predictive of pacemaker 
      battery depletion and clinical risk. METHODS: This is an ECG substudy of a cohort 
      analysis of 298 subjects referred for pacemaker generator replacement from 2006 to 
      2017. Electronic medical record review was performed; clinical, ECG, and pacemaker 
      characteristics were abstracted. We applied two ECG prediction rules for pacemaker 
      battery depletion that are relevant to all major pacemaker manufacturers except 
      Boston Scientific and MicroPort: (1) atrial pacing not at a multiple of 10 and (2) 
      nonsynchronous ventricular pacing not at a multiple of 10, to determine diagnostic 
      sensitivity, specificity, and risk in applicable ECG subjects. RESULTS: We excluded 
      32 subjects not at replacement notification or duplicate surgeries. Overall, 176 of 
      266 subjects (66.2%) demonstrated atrial pacing or nonsynchronous ventricular pacing 
      on preoperative ECG. When utilizing both rules, 139 of 176 preoperative ECGs and 12 
      of 163 postoperative ECGs met criteria for battery depletion yielding reasonable 
      sensitivity (79.0%), high specificity (92.6%), and a positive likelihood ratio of 
      11.6:1. These rules were associated with significant increase in cardiorespiratory 
      symptoms (P < .001) and adverse clinical events (P < .025). CONCLUSIONS: The "Rules 
      of Ten" provided reasonable sensitivity and specificity for detecting replacement 
      notification in pacemaker subjects with an applicable ECG. This ECG tool may help 
      clinicians identify most patients with pacemaker battery depletion at significant 
      clinical risk.

AB  - Sleep disorders, which negatively affect an individual's daily quality of life, are 
      a common problem for most of society. The most dangerous sleep disorder is 
      obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS), which manifests itself during sleep and can 
      cause the sudden death of patients. Many important parameters related to the 
      diagnosis and treatments of such sleep disorders are simultaneously examined. This 
      process is exhausting and time-consuming for experts and also requires experience; 
      thus, it can cause difference of opinion among experts. Because of this, automatic 
      sleep staging systems have been designed. In this study, a decision support system 
      was developed to determine OSAS patients. In the developed decision support system, 
      unlike in the available published literature, patient and healthy individual 
      classification was performed using only the Pulse Transition Time (PTT) parameter 
      rather than other parameters obtained from polysomnographic data like ECG 
      (Electrocardiogram), EEG (Electroencephalography), carbon dioxide measurement and 
      EMG (Electromyography). The suggested method can perform feature extraction from PTT 
      signals by means of a deep-learning method. AlexNet and VGG-16, which are two 
      Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models, have been used for feature extraction. 
      With the features obtained, patients and healthy individuals were classified by the 
      Support Vector Machine (SVM) and the k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) algorithms. When the 
      performance of the study was compared with other studies in published literature, it 
      was seen that satisfactory results were obtained.

AB  - Complexity-based analyses may quantify abnormalities in heart rate variability 
      (HRV). The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical and prognostic 
      significances of dynamic HRV changes in patients with stress-induced cardiomyopathy 
      Takotsubo syndrome (TS) by means of linear and nonlinear analysis. Patients with TS 
      were included in study after complete noninvasive and invasive cardiovascular 
      diagnostic evaluation and compared to an age and gender matched control group of 
      healthy subjects. Series of R-R interval and of ST-T interval values were obtained 
      from 24-h ECG recordings after digital sampling. HRV analysis was performed by 
      'range rescaled analysis' to determine the Hurst exponent, by detrended fluctuation 
      analysis to quantify fractal long-range correlation properties, and by approximate 
      entropy to assess time-series predictability. Short- and long-term fractal-scaling 
      exponents were significantly higher in patients with TS in acute phases, opposite to 
      lower approximate entropy and Hurst exponent, but all variables normalized in a few 
      weeks. Dynamic HRV analysis allows assessing changes in complexity features of HRV 
      in TS patients during the acute stage, and to monitor recovery after treatment, thus 
      complementing traditional ECG and clinically analysis.

AB  - Despite significant advances in adult clinical electrocardiography (ECG) signal 
      processing techniques and the power of digital processors, the analysis of 
      non-invasive foetal ECG (NI-FECG) is still in its infancy. The Physionet/Computing 
      in Cardiology Challenge 2013 addresses some of these limitations by making a set of 
      FECG data publicly available to the scientific community for evaluation of signal 
      processing techniques.The abdominal ECG signals were first preprocessed with a 
      band-pass filter in order to remove higher frequencies and baseline wander. A notch 
      filter to remove power interferences at 50 Hz or 60 Hz was applied if required. The 
      signals were then normalized before applying various source separation techniques to 
      cancel the maternal ECG. These techniques included: template subtraction, 
      principal/independent component analysis, extended Kalman filter and a combination 
      of a subset of these methods (FUSE method). Foetal QRS detection was performed on 
      all residuals using a Pan and Tompkins QRS detector and the residual channel with 
      the smoothest foetal heart rate time series was selected.The FUSE algorithm 
      performed better than all the individual methods on the training data set. On the 
      validation and test sets, the best Challenge scores obtained were E1 = 179.44, 
      E2 = 20.79, E3 = 153.07, E4 = 29.62 and E5 = 4.67 for events 1-5 respectively using 
      the FUSE method. These were the best Challenge scores for E1 and E2 and third and 
      second best Challenge scores for E3, E4 and E5 out of the 53 international teams 
      that entered the Challenge. The results demonstrated that existing standard 
      approaches for foetal heart rate estimation can be improved by fusing estimators 
      together. We provide open source code to enable benchmarking for each of the 
      standard approaches described.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Terminal QRS distortion on the electrocardiogram (ECG) is a sign of 
      severe ischemia in patients with STEMI and can be quantified by the 
      Sclarovsky-Birnbaum Severity of Ischemia. Due to score complexity, it has not been 
      applied in clinical practice. Automatic scoring of digitally recorded ECGs could 
      facilitate clinical application. We aimed to develop an automatic algorithm for the 
      severity of ischemia. METHODS: Development set: 50 STEMI ECGs were manually 
      (Manual-score) and automatically (Auto-score) scored by our designed algorithm. The 
      agreement between Manual- and Auto-score was assessed by kappa statistics. Test set: 
      ECGs from 199 STEMI patients were assigned a severity grade (severe or non-severe 
      ischemia) by the Auto-score. Infarct size estimated by median peak Troponin T (TnT) 
      and Creatinine Kinase Myocardial Band (CKMB) was tested between the groups. RESULTS: 
      The agreement between Manual- and Auto-score was 0.83 ((95% CI 0.55-1.00), 
      p < 0.0001), sensitivity 75% and specificity 100%, PPV 100% and NPV 94.6%. In the 
      test set 152 (76%) patients were male, mean age 61 ± 12 years. The Auto-score 
      designated severe ischemia in 42 (21%) and non-severe ischemia in 157 (79%) 
      patients. Patients with ECG signs of severe vs. non-severe ischemia had 
      significantly higher levels of biomarkers of infarct size. In multiple linear 
      regression, ECG sign of severe ischemia was an independent predictor for higher TnT 
      and CKMB levels. CONCLUSION: The automatic ECG algorithm for severity of ischemia in 
      STEMI performs adequately for clinical use. Severe ischemia obtained by the 
      Auto-score was associated with biomarker estimated larger infarct size.

AB  - Seismocardiography (SCG) is the measurement of vibrations in the sternum caused by 
      the beating of the heart. Precise cardiac mechanical timings that are easily 
      obtained from SCG are critically dependent on accurate identification of fiducial 
      points. So far, SCG annotation has relied on concurrent ECG measurements. An 
      algorithm capable of annotating SCG without the use any other concurrent measurement 
      was designed. We subjected 18 participants to graded lower body negative pressure. 
      We collected ECG and SCG, obtained R peaks from the former, and annotated the latter 
      by hand, using these identified peaks. We also annotated the SCG automatically. We 
      compared the isovolumic moment timings obtained by hand to those obtained using our 
      algorithm. Mean  ±  confidence interval of the percentage of accurately annotated 
      cardiac cycles were [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], 
      [Formula: see text], and [Formula: see text] for levels of negative pressure 0, -20, 
      -30, -40, and  -50 mmHg. LF/HF ratios, the relative power of low-frequency 
      variations to high-frequency variations in heart beat intervals, obtained from 
      isovolumic moments were also compared to those obtained from R peaks. The mean 
      differences  ±  confidence interval were [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], 
      [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], and [Formula: see text] for increasing 
      levels of negative pressure. The accuracy and consistency of the algorithm enables 
      the use of SCG as a stand-alone heart monitoring tool in healthy individuals at 
      rest, and could serve as a basis for an eventual application in pathological cases.

AB  - This study aimed to test how different QT interval variability (QTV) indices change 
      in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and congestive heart failure (CHF). 
      Twenty-nine healthy volunteers, 29 age-matched CAD patients, and 20 age-matched CHF 
      patients were studied. QT time series were derived from 5-min resting lead-II 
      electrocardiogram (ECG). Time domain indices [mean, SD, and QT variability index 
      (QTVI)], frequency-domain indices (LF and HF), and nonlinear indices [sample entropy 
      (SampEn), permutation entropy (PE), and dynamical patterns] were calculated. In 
      order to account for possible influence of heart rate (HR) on QTV, all the 
      calculations except QTVI were repeated on HR-corrected QT time series (QTc) using 
      three correction methods (i.e., Bazett, Fridericia, and Framingham method). Results 
      showed that CHF patients exhibited increased mean, increased SD, increased LF and 
      HF, decreased T-wave amplitude, increased QTVI, and decreased PE, while showed no 
      significant changes in SampEn. Interestingly, CHF patients also showed significantly 
      changed distribution of the dynamical patterns with less monotonously changing 
      patterns while more fluctuated patterns. In CAD group, only QTVI was found 
      significantly increased as compared with healthy controls. Results after HR 
      correction were in common with those before HR correction except for QTc based on 
      Bazett correction. Graphical abstract Fig. The framework of this paper. The arrows

TI  - Semia: semi-automatic interactive graphic editing tool to annotate ambulatory ECG 
      records.
PG  - 235-49
AB  - We designed and developed a special purpose interactive graphic editing tool 
      semi-automatic (Semia) to annotate transient ischaemic ST segment episodes and other 
      non-ischaemic ST segment events in 24h ambulatory electrocardiogram (ECG) records. 
      The tool allows representation and viewing of the data, interaction with the data 
      globally and locally at different resolutions, examining data at any point, manual 
      adjustment of heart-beat fiducial points, and manual and automatic editing of 
      annotations. Efficient and fast display of ambulatory ECG signal waveforms, display 
      of diagnostic and morphology feature-vector time-series, dynamic interface controls, 
      and automated procedures to help annotate, made the tool efficient, user friendly 
      and usable. Human expert annotators used the Semia tool to successfully annotate the 
      Long-Term ST database (LTST DB), a result of a multinational effort. The tool 
      supported paperless editing of annotations at dislocated geographical sites. We 
      present design, characteristic "look and feel", functionality, and development of 
      Semia annotating tool.

TI  - Unplanned transfer from the telemetry unit to the intensive care unit in 
      hospitalized patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Most patients presenting with suspected acute coronary syndrome (ACS) 
      are admitted to telemetry units. While telemetry is an appropriate level of care, 
      acute complications requiring a higher level of care in the intensive care unit 
      (ICU) occur. PURPOSE: Among patients admitted to telemetry for suspected ACS, we 
      determine the frequency of unplanned ICU transfer, and examine whether ECG changes 
      indicative of myocardial ischemia, and/or symptoms preceded unplanned transfer. 
      METHOD: This was a secondary analysis from a study assessing occurrence rates for 
      transient myocardial ischemia (TMI) using a 12-lead Holter. Clinicians were blinded 
      to Holter data as it was used in the context research; off-line analysis was 
      performed post discharge. Hospital telemetry monitoring was maintained as per 
      hospital protocol. TMI was defined as >1mm ST-segment ↑ or ↓, in >1 ECG lead, 
      >1minute. Symptoms were assessed by chart review. RESULTS: In 409 patients 
      (64±13years), most were men (60%), Caucasian (93%), and had a history of coronary 
      artery disease (47%). Unplanned transfer to the ICU occurred in 9 (2.2%), was 
      equivalent by gender, and age (no transfer 64±13years vs transfer 67±11years). Four 
      patients were transferred following unsuccessful percutaneous coronary intervention 
      (PCI) attempt, four due to recurrent angina, and one due to renal and hepatic 
      failure. Mean time from admission to transfer was 13±6hours, mean time to ECG 
      detected ischemia was 6±5hours, and 8.8±5hours for symptoms prompting transfer. In 
      two patients ECG detected ischemia and acute symptoms prompting transfer were 
      simultaneous. In five patients, ECG detected ischemia was clinically silent. All 
      patients eventually had symptoms that prompted transfer to the ICU. In all nine 
      patients, there was no documentation or nursing notes regarding bedside ECG monitor 
      changes prior to unplanned transfer. Hospital length of stay was longer in the 
      unplanned transfer group (2days ± 2 versus 6days ± 4; p=0.018). CONCLUSIONS: In 
      patients with suspected ACS, while unplanned transfer from telemetry to ICU is 
      uncommon, it is associated with prolonged hospitalization. Two primary scenarios 
      were identified; (1) following unsuccessful PCI, and (2) recurrent angina. Symptoms 
      prompting unplanned transfer occurred, but happened on average 8.8 hours after 
      hospital admission; whereas ECG detected ischemia preceding unplanned transfer 
      occurred on average 6 hours after hospital admission.

      assessment.
PG  - 20130755

LID - 20130755
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Assessment of myocardial function can be performed at higher noise levels 
      than necessary for coronary arterial evaluation. We evaluated image quality and 
      radiation exposure of a dose-conserving function-only acquisition vs retrospectively 
      electrocardiogram(ECG)-gated coronary CTA with automatic tube current modulation. 
      METHODS: Of 26 patients who underwent clinically indicated coronary CTA for coronary 
      and function evaluation, 13 (Group I) underwent prospectively ECG-triggered coronary 
      CTA, followed by low-dose retrospectively ECG-gated scan for function (128-slice 
      dual-source, 80 kVp; reference tube current, 100 mA; 8-mm-thick multiplanar 
      reformatted reconstructions) performed either immediately (n = 6) or after 5- to 
      10-min delay for infarct assessment (n = 7). 13 corresponding controls (Group II) 
      underwent retrospectively ECG-gated protocols (automatic tube potential selection 
      with CARE kV/CARE Dose 4D; Siemens Healthcare, Forchheim, Germany) with aggressive 
      dose modulation. Image quality assessment was performed on the six Group I subjects 
      who underwent early post-contrast dedicated function scan and corresponding 
      controls. Radiation exposure was based on dose-length product. RESULTS: 
      Contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) was preserved throughout the cardiac cycle in Group I 
      and varied according to dose modulation in Group II. Visual image quality indices 
      were similar during end systole but were better in Group II at end diastole. 
      Although the total radiation exposure was equivalent in Group I and Group II (284 vs 
      280 mGy cm), the median radiation exposure associated with only the dedicated 
      function scan was 138 mGy cm (interquartile range, 116-203 mGy cm). CONCLUSION: A 
      low-dose retrospective ECG-gated protocol permits assessment of myocardial function 
      at a median radiation exposure of 138 mGy cm and offers more consistent multiphase 
      CNR vs traditional ECG-modulation protocols. This is useful for pure functional 
      evaluation or as an adjunct to single-phase scan modes. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: 
      Radiation exposure can be limited with a tailored myocardial function CT protocol 
      while maintaining preserved images.

TI  - Freedom from atrial fibrillation after cox maze III ablation during follow-up.
PG  - 59-63
LID - 10.4103/0300-1652.149173 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nearly 60% of patients undergoing mitral valve (MV) operations are 
      affected by atrial fibrillation (AF). Cox Maze III ablation is one of the effective 
      ways for restoring sinus rhythm for patients undergoing open heart surgery. The aim 
      of present study was to evaluate efficacy of Maze III ablation procedure for 
      restoring sinus rhythm among patients who had underwent open heart surgery. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: During present descriptive-analytic prospective study 114 
      patients with chronic AF had undergone open heart surgery for their valvular or 
      coronary artery diseases in Educational-Medical centres of Tabriz University of 
      Medical Sciences (Tabriz, Iran) 2006-2012, were included in the study. For all 
      patients Maze III ablation was done. Patients were evaluated by 12 lead 
      electrocardiography (ECG) and 24 hours ambulatory ECG monitoring after 3-6 years 
      (mean 4.8) of follow-up. RESULT: Patients' rhythm before Cox Maze III surgery was 
      chronic AF in all patients. All patients were discharged from operating room with 
      sinus rhythm. During intensive care unit (ICU) hospitalization, rhythm of 34 
      patients changed to AF and 80 patients had sinus rhythm. Sixteen patients had 
      undergone electrical cardioversion for restoring sinus rhythm which was successful 
      in 12 patients. Ninety-two patients had sinus rhythm when discharged from the 
      hospital. After termination of follow-up, freedom from atrial fibrillation was 51%. 
      Patients with AF during follow-up on surface ECG didn't have episodes of sinus 
      rhythm in their ambulatory monitoring. One patient implanted cardiac pacemaker due 
      to persistent sinus bradycardia. CONCLUSION: Based on the results of this study, Cox 
      Maze III ablation procedure is an effective and safe way for restoring sinus rhythm 
      among patients who are candidate for open heart surgery, while no significant 
      complication was seen among patients.

TI  - Automatic Detection of Atrial Fibrillation Based on CNN-LSTM and Shortcut 
      Connection.
LID - E139 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/healthcare8020139 [doi]
AB  - Atrial fibrillation (AF) is one of the most common persistent arrhythmias, which has 
      a close connection to a large number of cardiovascular diseases. However, if spotted 
      early, the diagnosis of AF can improve the effectiveness of clinical treatment and 
      effectively prevent serious complications. In this paper, a combination of an 
      8-layer convolutional neural network (CNN) with a shortcut connection and 1-layer 
      long short-term memory (LSTM), named 8CSL, was proposed for the Electrocardiogram 
      (ECG) classification task. Compared with recurrent neural networks (RNN) and 
      multi-scale convolution neural networks (MCNN), not only can 8CSL extract features 
      skillfully, but also deal with long-term dependency between data. In particular, 
      8CSL includes eight shortcut connections that can improve the speed of the data 
      transmission and processing as a result of the shortcut connections. The model was 
      evaluated on the base of the test set of the Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2017 
      dataset with the F1 score. The ECG recordings were cropped or padded to the same 
      length. After 10-fold cross-validation, the average test F1 score was 84.89%, 
      89.55%, and 85.64% when the segment length was 5, 10, 20 seconds, respectively. The 
      experiment results demonstrate excellent performance with potential practical 
      applications.

TI  - Automatic detection and quantification of sleep apnea using heart rate variability.
PG  - 535-41
LID - 10.1016/j.jelectrocard.2010.07.003 [doi]
AB  - Detection of sleep apnea using electrocardiographic (ECG) parameters is noninvasive 
      and inexpensive. Our approach is based on the hypothesis that the patient's 
      sleep-wake cycle during episodes of sleep apnea modulates heart rate (HR) 
      oscillations. These HR oscillations appear as low-frequency fluctuations of 
      instantaneous HR (IHR) and can be detected using HR variability analysis in the 
      frequency domain. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of our 
      ECG-based algorithm for sleep apnea detection and quantification. The algorithm 
      first detects normal QRS complexes and R-R intervals used to derive IHR and to 
      estimate its spectral power in several frequency ranges. A quadratic classifier, 
      trained on the learning set, uses 2 parameters to classify the 1-minute epoch in the 
      middle of each 6-minute window as either apneic or normal. The windows are advanced 
      by 1-minute steps, and the classification process is repeated. As a measure of 
      quantification, the algorithm correctly classified 84.7% of all the 1-minute epochs 
      in the evaluation database; and as a measure of the accuracy of apnea 
      classification, the algorithm correctly classified all 30 test recordings in the 
      evaluation database either as apneic or normal. Our sleep apnea detection algorithm 
      based on analysis of a single-lead ECG provides accurate apnea detection and 
      quantification. Because of its noninvasive and low-cost nature, this algorithm has 
      the potential for numerous applications in sleep medicine.

AB  - This study proposes a robust similarity score-based time series feature extraction 
      method that is termed as Window-based Time series Feature ExtraCtion (WTC). 
      Specifically, WTC generates domain-interpretable results and involves significantly 
      low computational complexity thereby rendering itself useful for densely sampled and 
      populated time series datasets. In this study, WTC is applied to a proprietary 
      action potential (AP) time series dataset on human cardiomyocytes and three 
      precordial leads from a publicly available electrocardiogram (ECG) dataset. This is 
      followed by comparing WTC in terms of predictive accuracy and computational 
      complexity with shapelet transform and fast shapelet transform (which constitutes an 
      accelerated variant of the shapelet transform). The results indicate that WTC 
      achieves a slightly higher classification performance with significantly lower 
      execution time when compared to its shapelet-based alternatives. With respect to its 
      interpretable features, WTC has a potential to enable medical experts to explore 
      definitive common trends in novel datasets.

AB  - It is well known that there are gender differences in 12 lead ECG measurements, some 
      of which can be statistically significant. It is also an accepted practice that we 
      should consider those differences when we interpret ECGs, by either a human 
      overreader or a computerized algorithm. There are some major gender differences in 
      12 lead ECG measurements based on automatic algorithms, including global 
      measurements such as heart rate, QRS duration, QT interval, and lead-by-lead 
      measurements like QRS amplitude, ST level, etc. The interpretation criteria used in 
      the automatic algorithms can be adapted to the gender differences in the 
      measurements. The analysis of a group of 1339 patients with acute inferior MI showed 
      that for patients under age 60, women had lower ST elevations at the J point in lead 
      II than men (57±91μV vs. 86±117μV, p<0.02). This trend was reversed for patients 
      over age 60 (lead aVF: 102±126μV vs. 84±117μV, p<0.04; lead III: 130±146μV vs. 
      103±131μV, p<0.007). Therefore, the ST elevation thresholds were set based on 
      available gender and age information, which resulted in 25% relative sensitivity 
      improvement for women under age 60, while maintaining a high specificity of 98%. 
      Similar analyses were done for prolonged QT interval and LVH cases. The paper uses 
      several design examples to demonstrate (1) how to design a gender-specific 
      algorithm, and (2) how to design a robust ECG interpretation algorithm which relies 
      less on absolute threshold-based criteria and is instead more reliant on overall 
      morphology features, which are especially important when gender information is 
      unavailable for automatic analysis.

TI  - Echocardiography without electrocardiogram using nonlinear dimensionality reduction 
      methods.
PG  - 137-49
LID - 10.1007/s10396-014-0588-y [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficiency of a new automatic 
      image processing technique, based on nonlinear dimensionality reduction (NLDR) to 
      separate a cardiac cycle and also detect end-diastole (ED) (cardiac cycle start) and 
      end-systole (ES) frames on an echocardiography system without using ECG. METHODS: 
      Isometric feature mapping (Isomap) and locally linear embeddings (LLE) are the most 
      popular NLDR algorithms. First, Isomap algorithm is applied on recorded 
      echocardiography images. By this approach, the nonlinear embedded information in 
      sequential images is represented in a two-dimensional manifold and each image is 
      characterized by a symbol on the constructed manifold. Cyclicity analysis of the 
      resultant manifold, which is derived from the cyclic nature of the heart motion, is 
      used to perform cardiac cycle length estimation. Then, LLE algorithm is applied on 
      extracted left ventricle (LV) echocardiography images of one cardiac cycle. Finally, 
      the relationship between consecutive symbols of the resultant manifold by the LLE 
      algorithm, which is based on LV volume changes, is used to estimate ED (cycle start) 
      and ES frames. The proposed algorithms are quantitatively compared to those obtained 
      by a highly experienced echocardiographer from ECG as a reference in 20 healthy 
      volunteers and 12 subjects with pathology. RESULTS: Mean difference in cardiac cycle 
      length, ED, and ES frame estimation between our method and ECG detection by the 
      experienced echocardiographer is approximately 7, 17, and 17 ms (0.4, 1, and 1 
      frame), respectively. CONCLUSION: The proposed image-based method, based on NLDR, 
      can be used as a useful tool for estimation of cardiac cycle length, ED and ES 
      frames in echocardiography systems, with good agreement to ECG assessment by an 
      experienced echocardiographer in routine clinical evaluation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Automatic measurement becomes a preference, and indeed a necessity, when 
      analyzing 1000 s of ECGs in the setting of either drug-inducing QT prolongation 
      screening or genome-wide association studies of QT interval. The problem is that 
      individual manufacturers apply different computerized algorithms to measure QT 
      interval. We conducted a comparative study to assess the outcomes with different 
      automated measurements of QT interval between ECG machine manufacturers and 
      validated the related heart rate correction methods. METHODS AND RESULTS: Herein, we 
      directly compared these different commercial systems using 10,529 Fukuda Denshi ECGs 
      and 72,754 Nihon Kohden ECGs taken in healthy Japanese volunteers. Log-transformed 
      data revealed an equal optimal heart rate correction formula of QT interval for 
      Fukuda Denshi and Nihon Kohden, in the form of QTc = QT/RR(-0.347). However, with 
      the raw data, the optimal heart rate correction formula of QT interval was in the 
      form of QTc = QT+0.156×(1-RR) for Fukuda Denshi and QTc = QT+0.152×(1-RR) for Nihon 
      Kohden. After optimization of heart rate correction of QT interval by the linear 
      regression model using either log-transformed data or raw data, QTc interval was ∼10 
      ms longer in Nihon Kohden ECGs than in those recorded on Fukuda Denshi machines. 
      Indeed, regression analysis revealed that differences in the ECG machine used had up 
      to a two-fold larger impact on QT variation than gender difference. Such an impact 
      is likely to be of considerable importance when ECGs for a given individual are 
      recorded on different machines in the setting of multi-institutional joint research. 
      CONCLUSIONS: We recommend that ECG machines of the same manufacturer should be used 
      to measure QT and RR intervals in the setting of multi-institutional joint research. 
      It is desirable to unify the computer algorithm for automatic QT and RR measurements 
      from an ECG.

AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this quality improvement project was to facilitate a 
      sustainable improvement in the accuracy of cardiac electrode placement for 
      continuous bedside monitoring in intensive care unit patients. BACKGROUND: 
      Continuous cardiac electrocardiograph monitoring is a standard of practice in 
      critical care areas and is essential to accurate interpretation of cardiac 
      dysrhythmias and early detection of myocardial ischemia. Accurate assessment of 
      electrocardiographs depends on precise placement of electrodes; however, electrodes 
      are often placed inaccurately. RATIONALE: Evaluation of baseline practice revealed 
      that cardiac electrodes were placed correctly in only 12.5% of patients. The most 
      frequently misplaced electrode was the V lead, followed by lower limb leads. 
      DESCRIPTION: This project was conducted between July 1, 2013, and October 31, 2013, 
      and involved a multifaceted education program for registered nurse and patient care 
      technician staff on the physiologic basis and technical procedures for cardiac 
      electrode placement. The clinical nurse specialist served as an informal leader, 
      role model, and mentor by developing and empowering unit champions to perform 
      real-time auditing and provide real-time feedback to colleagues. OUTCOME: At 3 
      months after intervention, the accuracy of cardiac electrode placement was sustained 
      at greater than 85%, representing a 6-fold improvement above the preintervention 
      baseline. CONCLUSION: Sustainable improvement in quality requires creation of a 
      culture that supports quality improvement initiatives. As experts in clinical 
      practice, evidence-based practice, and leadership, clinical nurse specialists are 
      optimally positioned to function as change agents whose initiatives measurably 
      improve outcomes. IMPLICATIONS: This quality improvement project serves as a model 
      for improving accuracy of cardiac electrode placement at the nursing staff level. 
      Future research is necessary to improve outcomes related to accuracy of cardiac 
      electrode placement on the patient and systems levels.

AB  - Occult hemorrhage in surgical/trauma intensive care unit (STICU) patients is common 
      and may lead to circulatory collapse. Continuous electrocardiography (ECG) 
      monitoring may allow for early identification and treatment, and could improve 
      outcomes. We studied 4,259 consecutive admissions to the STICU at the University of 
      Virginia Health System. We collected ECG waveform data captured by bedside monitors 
      and calculated linear and non-linear measures of the RR interbeat intervals. We 
      tested the hypothesis that a transfusion requirement of 3 or more PRBC transfusions 
      in a 24 hour period is preceded by dynamical changes in these heart rate measures 
      and performed logistic regression modeling. We identified 308 hemorrhage events. A 
      multivariate model including heart rate, standard deviation of the RR intervals, 
      detrended fluctuation analysis, and local dynamics density had a C-statistic of 
      0.62. Earlier detection of hemorrhage might improve outcomes by allowing earlier 
      resuscitation in STICU patients.

LID - 10.4103/0971-9784.91482 [doi]
AB  - Interference of monitored electrocardiogram (ECG) is a common event in intensive 
      care units and operation theaters. Artifacts in the ECG tracing can resemble serious 
      arrhythmia, thus leading to unnecessary usage of antiarrhythmics or electrical 
      defibrillation. In addition, ECG artifacts may lead to serious hemodynamic 
      consequences secondary to intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) trigger failure. We 
      report a rare event of IABP failure due to ECG artifact, which appeared on placement 
      of the transthoracic echocardiography probe over the chest. Subsequent evaluation 
      revealed potential current leakage from echocardiography machine secondary to 
      earthing defect in the machine.

      clinical consequences.
PG  - 348-53
LID - 10.1002/clc.22000 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to determine the frequency and nature of 
      errors made by computer electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis of atrial fibrillation 
      (AF), and the clinical consequences. HYPOTHESIS: Computer software for interpreting 
      ECGs has advanced. METHODS: A total of 10279 ECGs were collected, automatically 
      interpreted by the built-in ECG software, and then reread by 2 cardiologists. 
      AF-related ECGs were classified into 3 groups: overinterpreted AF (rhythms other 
      than AF interpreted as AF), misinterpreted AF (AF interpreted as rhythms other than 
      AF), and true AF (AF interpreted as AF by both computer ECG interpretation and 
      cardiologists). RESULTS: There were 1057 AF-related ECGs from 409 patients. Among 
      these, 840 ECGs (79.5%) were true AF. Overinterpretation occurred in 98 (9.3%) 
      cases. Sinus rhythm and sinus tachycardia with premature atrial contraction and/or 
      baseline artifact and sinus arrhythmia were commonly overinterpreted as AF. Heart 
      rate ≤60 bpm and baseline artifact significantly increased the likelihood of 
      overinterpreted AF. Misdiagnosis occurred in 119 (11.3%) cases, in which AF was 
      usually misdiagnosed as sinus or supraventricular tachycardia. The presence of 
      tachycardia and low-amplitude atrial activity significantly increased the likelihood 
      of misdiagnosis of AF. Among the erroneous computer ECG interpretations, 17 cases 
      (7.8%) were not corrected by the ordering physicians and/or repeat computer-ECG 
      interpretation; inappropriate follow-up studies or treatments of the patients were 
      undertaken with no serious sequelae. CONCLUSIONS: Erroneous computer ECG 
      interpretation of AF was not rare. Attention should be concentrated on educating 
      physicians about ECG appearance and confounding factors of AF, along with ongoing 
      quality control of built-in software for automatic ECG interpretation.

AB  - CONTEXT: Medications commonly used for symptom control along with other known risk 
      factors have the potential to prolong ventricular repolarization as measured by the 
      QT interval (the time from the start of the Q wave to the end of the T wave) on a 
      standard electrocardiogram (ECG). OBJECTIVES: To document the prevalence of a 
      prolonged QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTc) interval in the 
      palliative/oncology setting, compare automatic ECG QTc measurements with manual 
      readings and identify any correlation between QTc prolongation and the use of drugs 
      or other risk factors. METHODS: A convenience sample of consecutive patients with 
      cancer, admitted under or known to the palliative/supportive care teams in two 
      metropolitan hospitals, and willing to provide an ECG recording and basic 
      demographic information including QTc risk factors were included. Both automated and 
      manually calculated QTc intervals were recorded. Multivariable analysis was used to 
      determine risk factors independently associated with prolonged QTc intervals. 
      RESULTS: Of the 389 participants, there was a significant difference in mean QTc 
      between sites using automated but not manual calculations. Manual readings were 
      therefore used with predetermined cutoffs of 0.44 seconds (males) and 0.46 seconds 
      (females). Seventy-two (18.5%) of the participants had a prolonged QTc with six 
      (1.5%) having a prolongation of >0.50 seconds. At-risk drugs were being taken by 218 
      participants (56.0% of total cohort). Factors shown to be associated with QTc 
      prolongation included age, gender, performance status, and hypocalcemia. No specific 
      medication was associated with increased risk. CONCLUSION: Although almost 20% of 
      patients receiving palliative care had prolongation of QTc, the possibility of 
      serious consequences appeared to be low despite the frequent occurrence of risk 
      factors.

PG  - 181-90
AB  - Beat-to-beat variability of arterial pressure and heart period (R-R) was studied in 
      eight conscious freely-moving adult male rats in which telemetric recordings of 
      arterial pressure, ECG and respiratory movements were obtained under unrestrained 
      and unstressed conditions. The beat-to-beat time series of these signals (systolic 
      arterial pressure, diastolic arterial pressure and R-R) were analyzed, in the 
      frequency domain, using autoregressive spectral analysis in order to detect and 
      quantify the rhythmic components. In basal conditions, the systolic arterial 
      pressure variability spectrum was characterized by three major spectral components 
      which had central frequencies respectively of 0.08 +/- 0.03 Hz (very low frequency), 
      0.43 +/- 0.02 Hz (low frequency) and 1.36 +/- 0.19 Hz (high frequency). Similar 
      rhythmic components were found in R-R signal variability. The very low frequency 
      component included a higher percentage of total power in R-R variability spectrum 
      (75.3%) than in systolic arterial pressure variability spectrum (58.4%). The low 
      frequency component was more pronounced in both systolic and diastolic arterial 
      pressure variability spectra. The high frequency component of R-R, systolic and 
      diastolic arterial pressure was synchronous with respiration. Cross-spectral 
      analysis revealed a high statistical coherence between R-R and arterial pressure 
      variabilities in all the three frequency bands. An alpha-adrenergic blocker 
      (phentolamine) specifically abolished the low frequency components of systolic and 
      diastolic arterial pressure variability spectra, thus suggesting that low frequency 
      is a marker of sympathetic modulation of vasomotor activity. The low frequency 
      component of R-R variability spectrum was also markedly blunted. We suggest that 
      cardiovascular variability signals, (R-R, systolic and diastolic arterial pressure) 
      are composed almost of two main rhythms linked to respiration and vasomotor 
      activity. These rhythms can be quantified in conscious unrestrained rats by using 
      telemetry and spectral analysis. This approach seems to offer a new powerful tool 
      for pharmacological studies in conscious small animals.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Patients admitted into a medical Intensive Care Unit (ICU) have 
      varying illnesses and risk factors. An electrocardiogram (ECG) is a useful tool to 
      assess the cardiac status. The aim of the study was to determine the prevalence of 
      QT prolongation of the ECG in patients admitted to a medical ICU in a tertiary 
      hospital, to assess outcomes in terms of mortality, cardiovascular events, and 
      duration of ICU stay. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Prospective observational study, 6 
      months duration, assessing the prevalence of prolonged corrected QT interval (QTc) 
      at admission into a medical ICU. A QTc calculated by Bazett's formula, of >440 ms 
      for males and >460 ms for females was considered prolonged. Details of illness, 
      clinical and lab parameters were monitored. RESULTS: The total number of patients 
      screened was 182. There was a high prevalence of prolonged QTc (30%) on admission to 
      the ICU. This reduced to 19% on day 3 (P = 0.011). In patients with a prolonged QTc 
      the odds ratio of adverse outcome from ICU was 3.17 (confidence interval [CI]: 
      1.52-6.63) (P = 0.001) and of adverse outcome for hospital stay was 2.27 (CI: 
      1.11-4.66) (P = 0.014). In the study, 35% of all patients received drugs with QT 
      prolonging action. Of patients with a prolonged QTc at admission 18 (35%) received a 
      QT prolonging drug. CONCLUSIONS: We found that prolonged QTc is common (30%) in our 
      medical ICU at admission and a large proportion (35%) received drugs capable of 
      prolonging QT interval. These patients with QTc prolongation have a higher odds 
      ratio for adverse outcomes.

TI  - Antidepressant or Antipsychotic Overdose in the Intensive Care Unit - Identification 
      of Patients at Risk.
PG  - 110-4
LID - 10.1111/bcpt.12541 [doi]
AB  - It is often advised that patients who have ingested an overdose of antidepressants 
      (AD) or antipsychotics (AP) are monitored with continuous ECG for minimum of 12-24 
      hr. These patients are often observed in an ICU. Our aim was to identify the number 
      of patients with AD and/or AP overdose without adverse signs at hospital admission 
      that turned out to need intensive care treatment. The effect of the antidepressants 
      overdose risk assessment (ADORA) system was evaluated in patients with 
      antidepressant as well as antipsychotic overdose. Our hypothesis was that patients 
      with low ADORA do not need intensive care treatment. This retrospective study was 
      conducted in adult patients admitted to the ICU at Odense University Hospital after 
      an overdose with AP and/or AD between 1 January 2009 and 1 September 2014. Patients 
      with predefined adverse signs in the emergency department were excluded due to 
      obvious need of intensive care. Of the 157 patients included, 12 patients (8%) 
      developed events during the ICU stay. Only 3 patients received intubation, 
      vasoactive drugs and/or dialysis. None developed ventricular dysrhythmias. There 
      were no fatalities. All the patients with low-risk assessment by ADORA within the 
      first 6 hr did not develop events within the first 24 hr after hospital admission. 
      The vast majority of patients with AD and/or AP overdose and no adverse signs at 
      admission did not require intensive care treatment. Low-risk ADORA identified 
      patients with antidepressant as well as antipsychotic overdose who would not require 
      initial intensive care treatment. This is the first time the ADORA system has been 
      evaluated in patients with antidepressant as well as antipsychotic overdose.

AB  - Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmias causing morbidity 
      and mortality. AF may appear as episodes of very short (i.e., proximal AF) or 
      sustained duration (i.e., persistent AF), either form of which causes irregular 
      ventricular excitations that affect the global function of the heart. It is an unmet 
      challenge for early and automatic detection of AF, limiting efficient treatment 
      strategies for AF. In this study, we developed a new method based on continuous 
      wavelet transform and 2D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to detect AF episodes. 
      The proposed method analyzed the time-frequency features of the electrocardiogram 
      (ECG), thus being different to conventional AF detecting methods that implement 
      isolating atrial or ventricular activities. Then a 2D CNN was trained to improve AF 
      detection performance. The MIT-BIH Atrial Fibrillation Database was used for 
      evaluating the algorithm. The efficacy of the proposed method was compared with 
      those of some existing methods, most of which implemented the same dataset. The 
      newly developed algorithm using CNNs achieved 99.41, 98.91, 99.39, and 99.23% for 
      the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and overall accuracy (ACC) 
      respectively. As the proposed algorithm targets the time-frequency feature of ECG 
      signals rather than isolated atrial or ventricular activity, it has the ability to 
      detect AF episodes for using just five beats, suggesting practical applications in 
      the future.

TI  - Assessment of Joint Interactions between Respiration and Baroreflex Activity using 
      Joint Symbolic Dynamics in Heart Failure Patients.
PG  - 809-812
AB  - In this paper we employed a novel approach based on joint symbolic dynamics (JSD) to 
      study interaction between respiratory phase and baroreflex activity. 
      Electrocardiogram (ECG) and blood pressure recordings from six participants with 
      history of heart failure were included in this study. First, the ECG R-peaks and 
      systolic blood pressure indices were detected using parabolic fitting. Second, the 
      respiratory signal was derived from Frank orthogonal ECG leads using QRS slopes and 
      R-wave angles. Third, time series of R-R intervals and systolic blood pressure (SBP) 
      were extracted, and respiratory phases were obtained using the Hilbert transform. 
      Subsequently, each series was transformed into binary symbol vectors based on their 
      successive changes and words of length '2' were formed. Baroreflex patterns were 
      studied using word combinations representing baroreflex activity for specific 
      changes in respiratory phases. Baroreflex activity was significantly higher for 
      alternating low-high/high-low heart rate and SBP during inspiration as compared to 
      continuous increase or decrease in heart rate and SBP ([Formula: see text], 
      w(RP)=11: 39.1±9.3% vs. [Formula: see text], w(RP)=11: 6.4±3.9%, p<0.0001).

TI  - ECG-Based Classification of Resuscitation Cardiac Rhythms for Retrospective Data 
      Analysis.
PG  - 2411-2418
LID - 10.1109/TBME.2017.2688380 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: There is a need to monitor the heart rhythm in resuscitation to improve 
      treatment quality. Resuscitation rhythms are categorized into: ventricular 
      tachycardia (VT), ventricular fibrillation (VF), pulseless electrical activity 
      (PEA), asystole (AS), and pulse-generating rhythm (PR). Manual annotation of rhythms 
      is time-consuming and infeasible for large datasets. Our objective was to develop 
      ECG-based algorithms for the retrospective and automatic classification of 
      resuscitation cardiac rhythms. METHODS: The dataset consisted of 1631 3-s ECG 
      segments with clinical rhythm annotations, obtained from 298 out-of-hospital cardiac 
      arrest patients. In total, 47 wavelet- and time-domain-based features were computed 
      from the ECG. Features were selected using a wrapper-based feature selection 
      architecture. Classifiers based on Bayesian decision theory, k-nearest neighbor, 
      k-local hyperplane distance nearest neighbor, artificial neural network (ANN), and 
      ensemble of decision trees were studied. RESULTS: The best results were obtained for 
      ANN classifier with Bayesian regularization backpropagation training algorithm with 
      14 features, which forms the proposed algorithm. The overall accuracy for the 
      proposed algorithm was 78.5%. The sensitivities (and positive-predictive-values) for 
      AS, PEA, PR, VF, and VT were 88.7% (91.0%), 68.9% (70.4%), 65.9% (69.0%), 86.2% 
      (83.8%), and 78.8% (72.9%), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate that 
      it is possible to classify resuscitation cardiac rhythms automatically, but the 
      accuracy for the organized rhythms (PEA and PR) is low. SIGNIFICANCE: We have made 
      an important step toward making classification of resuscitation rhythms more 
      efficient in the sense of minimal feedback from human experts.

      congenital long-QT syndrome.
PG  - 456-64
LID - 10.1161/CIRCEP.110.958827 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The main ECG criteria for the diagnosis of long-QT syndrome (LQTS) 
      include abnormal T-wave morphology as well as prolonged QT interval. The T wave in 
      LQTS probably includes additional components of the myocardial repolarization 
      process, which are derived from aberrant ion currents. We investigated whether 
      independent component analysis (ICA) can extract such abnormal repolarization 
      components. METHODS AND RESULTS: Digital ECG data were obtained as a time series 
      from 10 channels using 20 surface electrodes in 22 patients with genetically 
      confirmed LQTS type 1 (LQT1) and 30 normal subjects. In each case, T-wave area was 
      analyzed by radical ICA after noise reduction by the wavelet thresholding method. 
      Furthermore, inverse ICA was applied to determine the origin of each independent 
      component (IC). Radical ICA revealed that a T-wave consisted of 4 basic ICs in all 
      control subjects, whereas ≥ 5 (mostly 6) ICs were identified in all 22 patients with 
      LQT1. The extra ICs, which were not evident in normal subjects, were assumed to 
      contribute to the formation of abnormal T-wave morphology. The extra ICs were 
      identified even in patients with normal QTc values and in those taking β-blockers. 
      Inverse ICA indicated that the additional ICs originate predominantly from the late 
      phase of the T wave of the left ventricle. CONCLUSIONS: Extra ICs appear during 
      repolarization in all patients with LQT1 but not in normal subjects. ICA is a 
      potentially useful multivariate statistical method to differentiate patients with 
      LQT1 from normal subjects.

TI  - Spectral analysis of heart rate variability as a quantitative measure of 
      parasympatholytic effect--integrated pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of three 
      anticholinergic drugs.
PG  - 141-51
AB  - The time course and concentration-effect relationship of parasympatholytic effects 
      of three anticholinergic drugs were investigated using spectral analysis of heart 
      rate (HR) variability. Single intravenous (i.v.) doses of atropine (10 microg/kg), 
      glycopyrrolate (5 microg/kg), scopolamine (5 microg/kg), and placebo were given to 
      eight healthy volunteers in a double-blind, randomized cross-over study. 
      Electrocardiogram (ECG) was recorded at baseline and 2.5, 5, 10, 20, and 30 minutes, 
      and 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 hours after drug administration, while the subjects 
      breathed at a fixed 0.25 Hz frequency. The powers of two frequency bands (low 
      frequency [LF] = 0.07-0.15 Hz and high frequency [HF] = 0.15-0.40 Hz) were 
      calculated using stationary time series of R-R intervals (RRI) free from ectopic 
      beats. To perform pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) modeling, venous plasma 
      drug concentrations were measured. Atropine and glycopyrrolate, and, to a lesser 
      extent, scopolamine induced decreases in HF power and increases in LF/HF ratio of HR 
      variability, indicating parasympatholytic activity and corresponding changes in 
      sympathovagal balance. Maximal average decreases in HF power were 99%, 94%, and 82%, 
      respectively, but in two scopolamine subjects, a parasympathomimetic effect was 
      dominant. Interindividual variability was least for the Hayano index of HF power 
      (square root (RRI HF-power)/RRI*100), and profound and consistent decreases were 
      seen after atropine and glycopyrrolate. Pharmacokinetics were best fitted to a 
      two-compartment open model, and effect compartment link modeling using the Hayano 
      index was performed with the atropine and glycopyrrolate data. The best description 
      of the PK-PD relationship for both drugs was achieved using the sigmoidal Emax 
      model. Mean (+/-SD) EC50, sigmoidicity factor (gamma), and equilibration rate 
      constant (k(e0)) estimates were 1.35 (+/-0.27) ng/mL, 6.07 (+/-1.98) and 11.0 
      (+/-5.28) l/h for atropine and 1.35 (+/-0.49) ng/mL, 4.34 (+/-1.55) and 2.26 
      (+/-0.81) l/h for glycopyrrolate. Spectral analysis of HR variability appears to be 
      a powerful tool in monitoring parasympatholytic drug activity. A sigmoidal Emax 
      model with an extremely steep concentration-response relationship was revealed for 
      atropine and glycopyrrolate. The effects of scopolamine were more incongruous.

LID - 8088 [pii]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the clinical effectiveness of continuous blood purification 
      (CBP) in combination with ulinastatin for the treatment of thermoplegia. PATIENTS 
      AND METHODS: Forty patients (28 men and 12 women) with severe heat stroke were 
      admitted to our hospital's ICU department from June 2010 to August 2013. The 
      patients were randomized into a treatment group (n=21; 15 men and six women, with an 
      average age of 32.9 years) and control group (n=19; 13 men and six women, with an 
      average age of 33.1 years). Patients in the control group underwent treatments of 
      oxygen inhalation, dynamic ECG monitoring, physical cooling methods (ice caps or ice 
      application), whereas patients in the treatment group, in addition to this 
      treatment, were further treated with continuous blood purification in combination 
      with ulinastatin. During administration, the content of one vial was dissolved in 
      100 mL of physiological saline for intravenous dripping for 1.5 hours. RESULTS: 
      There were 18 cured cases, one case of sequelae of mild neurological disorders, and 
      two deaths in the treatment group, with the cure rate of 90.48%. In comparison, 
      there were 12 cured cases, three cases of sequelae of mild neurological disorders, 
      and four deaths in the control group, with the cure rate of 78.95%. The overall 
      response rates of rectal temperature drop were determined to be 95.24% and 73.68% 
      for the treatment group and the control group, respectively. Based on the treatment 
      outcomes data, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) recovery, deaths and 
      survival outcomes of patients in the treatment group was more favorable than that of 
      the control group. This difference was statistically significant (p < 0.05). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Continuous blood purification in combination with ulinastatin is 
      effective in treating thermoplegia and warrants further investigation.

AB  - The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a biophysical electric signal generated by the heart 
      muscle, and is one of the major measurements of how well a heart functions. 
      Automatic ECG analysis algorithms usually extract the geometric or frequency-domain 
      features of the ECG signals and have already significantly facilitated automatic 
      ECG-based cardiac disease diagnosis. We propose a novel ECG feature by fitting a 
      given ECG signal with a 20th order polynomial function, defined as PolyECG-S. The 
      PolyECG-S feature is almost identical to the fitted ECG curve, measured by the 
      Akaike information criterion (AIC), and achieved a 94.4% accuracy in detecting the 
      Myocardial Infarction (MI) on the test dataset. Currently ST segment elongation is 
      one of the major ways to detect MI (ST-elevation myocardial infarction, STEMI). 
      However, many ECG signals have weak or even undetectable ST segments. Since 
      PolyECG-S does not rely on the information of ST waves, it can be used as a 
      complementary MI detection algorithm with the STEMI strategy. Overall, our results 
      suggest that the PolyECG-S feature may satisfactorily reconstruct the fitted ECG 
      curve, and is complementary to the existing ECG features for automatic cardiac 
      function analysis.

TI  - [Clinical usefulness of low tube current scanning with full reconstruction and

      coronary CT angiography using 320-row area detector CT].
PG  - 237-45

AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to validate the clinical usefulness of 
      Advanced Patient Motion Correction (APMC) reconstruction when motion artifacts were 
      observed in a prospective ECG-gated coronary CT angiography (CCTA), which was 
      acquired by low tube current scanning with full reconstruction using 320-row area 
      detector CT (0.275 s/rot.). METHODS: Of 530 consecutive CCTA, we selected 119 
      patients (M/F: 71/48, Age: 69 ± 11 y, BMI: 23.5 ± 2.5) with (RR-PQ) ≥ 968 ms before 
      scanning, and performed a CCTA with low tube current scanning [30% of usual tube 
      current (30%mA)], adaptive iterative dose reduction 3D, and full reconstruction. 
      Image quality for motion artifacts was subjectively evaluated using a 3-point scale 
      (excellent, acceptable, and unacceptable). RESULTS: Of 119, 102 CCTA had "excellent" 
      images (group A) and 17 had "acceptable" images (group B). The APMC and half 
      reconstruction were retried in the 17 CCTA with "acceptable" images. Finally, all 
      CCTA became "excellent" images. The RR-PQ of group B during scanning (966 ± 80 ms) 
      was significantly (P = 0.0001) shorter than group A (1,088 ± 123 ms). Each image 
      noise (standard deviation of CT value) of aorta, left atrium, and left ventricle was 
      21.7 ± 2.3, 24.7 ± 2.3, 24.5 ± 2.4 in full, 25.7 ± 2.2, 29.0 ± 3.4, 28.2 ± 2.7 in 
      APMC, and 30.4 ± 2.8, 34.3 ± 4.2, 33.3 ± 2.9 HU in half reconstruction. Mean 
      dose-length product of all patients was 66.2 ± 34.4 mGy · cm. CONCLUSION: 
      "Excellent" CCTA images can be obtained in 85.7% of patients with (RR-PQ)≥ 968 ms by 
      full reconstruction. APMC is useful for motion artifacts and image noise reduction 
      when patient' s HR increases during scanning rather than half reconstruction.

AB  - Manual processing of sleep recordings is extremely time-consuming. Efforts to 
      automate this process have shown promising results, but automatic systems are 
      generally evaluated on private databases, not allowing accurate cross-validation 
      with other systems. In lacking a common benchmark, the relative performances of 
      different systems are not compared easily and advances are compromised. To address 
      this fundamental methodological impediment to sleep study, we propose an open-access 
      database of polysomnographic biosignals. To build this database, whole-night 
      recordings from 200 participants [97 males (aged 42.9 ± 19.8 years) and 103 females 
      (aged 38.3 ± 18.9 years); age range: 18-76 years] were pooled from eight different 
      research protocols performed in three different hospital-based sleep laboratories. 
      All recordings feature a sampling frequency of 256 Hz and an electroencephalography 
      (EEG) montage of 4-20 channels plus standard electro-oculography (EOG), 
      electromyography (EMG), electrocardiography (ECG) and respiratory signals. Access to 
      the database can be obtained through the Montreal Archive of Sleep Studies (MASS) 
      website (http://www.ceams-carsm.ca/en/MASS), and requires only affiliation with a 
      research institution and prior approval by the applicant's local ethical review 
      board. Providing the research community with access to this free and open sleep 
      database is expected to facilitate the development and cross-validation of sleep 
      analysis automation systems. It is also expected that such a shared resource will be 
      a catalyst for cross-centre collaborations on difficult topics such as improving 
      inter-rater agreement on sleep stage scoring.

TI  - Upper limits of the photon fluence rate on CT detectors: Case study on a commercial 
      scanner.
PG  - 4398
LID - 10.1118/1.4954008 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The highest photon fluence rate that a computed tomography (CT) detector 
      must be able to measure is an important parameter. The authors calculate the maximum 
      transmitted fluence rate in a commercial CT scanner as a function of patient size 
      for standard head, chest, and abdomen protocols. METHODS: The authors scanned an 
      anthropomorphic phantom (Kyoto Kagaku PBU-60) with the reference CT protocols 
      provided by AAPM on a GE LightSpeed VCT scanner and noted the tube current applied 
      with the tube current modulation (TCM) system. By rescaling this tube current using 
      published measurements on the tube current modulation of a GE scanner [N. Keat, "CT 
      scanner automatic exposure control systems," MHRA Evaluation Report 05016, ImPACT, 
      London, UK, 2005], the authors could estimate the tube current that these protocols 
      would have resulted in for other patient sizes. An ECG gated chest protocol was also 
      simulated. Using measured dose rate profiles along the bowtie filters, the authors 
      simulated imaging of anonymized patient images with a range of sizes on a GE VCT 
      scanner and calculated the maximum transmitted fluence rate. In addition, the 99th 
      and the 95th percentiles of the transmitted fluence rate distribution behind the 
      patient are calculated and the effect of omitting projection lines passing just 
      below the skin line is investigated. RESULTS: The highest transmitted fluence rates 
      on the detector for the AAPM reference protocols with centered patients are found 
      for head images and for intermediate-sized chest images, both with a maximum of 3.4 
      ⋅ 10(8) mm(-2) s(-1), at 949 mm distance from the source. Miscentering the head by 
      50 mm downward increases the maximum transmitted fluence rate to 5.7 ⋅ 10(8) mm(-2) 
      s(-1). The ECG gated chest protocol gives fluence rates up to 2.3 ⋅ 10(8) - 3.6 ⋅ 
      10(8) mm(-2) s(-1) depending on miscentering. CONCLUSIONS: The fluence rate on a CT 
      detector reaches 3 ⋅ 10(8) - 6 ⋅ 10(8) mm(-2) s(-1) in standard imaging protocols, 
      with the highest rates occurring for ECG gated chest and miscentered head scans. 
      These results will be useful to developers of CT detectors, in particular photon 
      counting detectors.

TI  - A computational intelligence tool for the detection of hypertension using empirical 
      mode decomposition.

AB  - Hypertension (HPT), also known as high blood pressure, is a precursor to heart, 
      brain or kidney diseases. Some symptoms of HPT include headaches, dizziness and 
      fainting. The potential diagnosis of masked hypertension is of specific interest in 
      this study. In masked hypertension (MHPT), the instantaneous blood pressure appears 
      normal, but the 24-h ambulatory blood pressure is abnormal. Hence patients with MHPT 
      are difficult to identify and thus remain untreated or are treated insufficiently. 
      Hence, a computational intelligence tool (CIT) using electrocardiograms (ECG) 
      signals for HPT and possible MHPT detection is proposed in this work. Empirical mode 
      decomposition (EMD) is employed to decompose the pre-processed signals up to five 
      levels. Nonlinear features are extracted from the five intrinsic mode functions 
      (IMFs) thereafter. Student's t-test is subsequently applied to select a set of 
      highly discriminatory features. This feature set is then input to various 
      classifiers, in which, the best accuracy of 97.70% is yielded by the k-nearest 
      neighbor (k-NN) classifier. The developed tool is evaluated by the 10-fold cross 
      validation technique. Our findings suggest that the developed system is useful for 
      diagnostic computational intelligence tool in hospital settings, and that it enables 
      the automatic classification of HPT versus normal ECG signals.

TI  - Baseline elevation and reduction in cardiac electrical instability assessed by 
      quantitative T-wave alternans in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy treated with 
      vagus nerve stimulation in the AspireSR E-36 trial.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Reports of cardiac arrhythmias and cardiac pathology at postmortem 
      examination of patients with epilepsy suggest a possible cardiac component of risk 
      for sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). T-wave alternans (TWA) is an 
      established marker of cardiac electrical instability and risk for sudden death in 
      patients with cardiovascular disease. We determined the TWA level before vagus nerve 
      stimulation (VNS) system implantation and subsequently the effect of VNS on TWA in 
      patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. METHODS: Patients (n=28) from the Seizure 
      Detection and Automatic Magnet Mode Performance Study (E-36), a clinical trial of 
      the AspireSR® VNS Therapy System® (NCT01325623), were monitored with ambulatory 
      electrocardiograms (ECGs) ~2weeks before de novo VNS system implantation and 
      following 2- to 4-week VNS titration during a protocol-specified 3- to 5-day 
      epilepsy monitoring unit stay with concurrent EEG/ECG recordings. The TWA level was 
      assessed interictally by the Modified Moving Average (MMA) method. RESULTS: At 
      preimplantation baseline, TWA was elevated above the 47-μV abnormality cutpoint in 
      23 (82%) patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. In 16 (70%) patients, TWA level was 
      reduced during VNS treatment to <47μV, thereby converting positive TWA test results 
      to negative. Peak TWA level in all 28 patients improved (group mean, 43%, from 
      72±4.3 to 41±2.3μV; p<0.0001). Vagus nerve stimulation was not associated with 
      reduced heart rate (77±1.4 to 75±1.4beats/min; p=0.18). Heart rate variability was 
      unchanged. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings suggest significant interictal cardiac 
      electrical instability in this population of patients with drug-resistant epilepsy 
      and suggest that VNS may be a novel approach to reducing risk.

TI  - A multi-stage automatic arrhythmia recognition and classification system.
PG  - 37-45
LID - 10.1016/j.compbiomed.2010.11.003 [doi]
AB  - This paper describes an automatic classification system based on combination of 
      diverse features for the purpose of automatic heartbeat recognition. The method 
      consists of three stages. At the first stage, heartbeats are classified into 5 main 
      groups defined by AAMI using optimal feature sets for each main group. At the second 
      stage, main groups are classified into subgroups using optimal features for each 
      subgroup. Then the third stage is added to the system for classifying beats that are 
      labeled as unclassified beats in the first two classification stages. A diverse set 
      of features including higher order statistics, morphological features, Fourier 
      transform coefficients, and higher order statistics of the wavelet package 
      coefficients are extracted for each different type of ECG beat. At the first stage, 
      optimal features for main groups are determined by using a wrapper type feature 
      selection algorithm. At the second stage, optimal features are similarly selected 
      for discriminating each subgroup of the main groups. Then at the third stage, only 
      raw data is used for classifying beats. In all stages, the classifiers are based on 
      the k-nearest neighbor algorithm. ECG records used in this study are obtained from 
      the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database. The classification accuracy of the proposed system 
      is measured by sensitivity, selectivity, and specificity measures. The system is 
      classified 16 heartbeat types. The measures of proposed system are 85.59%, 95.46%, 
      and 99.56%, for average sensitivity, average selectivity, and average specificity, 
      respectively.

AB  - Biosignals are usually contaminated with artifacts from limb movements, muscular 
      contraction or electrical interference. Many algorithms of the literature, such as 
      threshold methods and adaptive filters, focus on detecting these noisy patterns. 
      This study introduces a novel method for noise and artifact detection in 
      electrocardiogram based on time series clustering. The algorithm starts with the 
      extraction of features that best characterize the shape and behaviour of the signal 
      over time and groups its samples in separated clusters by means of an agglomerative 
      clustering approach. The method has been tested in numerous datasets to reveal that 
      it is independent on specific records and globally, the algorithm was able to 
      successfully detect noisy patterns and artifacts with a sensitivity of 88%, a 
      specificity of 92% and an accuracy of 91%, demonstrating a good performance in 
      pattern detection based on morphological clustering. This algorithm can be applied 
      to the detection and sectioning of multiple types of noise for more accurate 
      denoising and adapted for signal classification.

AB  - The automatic computation of the hypnogram and sleep Parameters, from the data 
      acquired with portable sensors, is a challenging problem with important clinical 
      applications. In this paper, the hypnogram, the sleep efficiency (SE), rapid eye 
      movement (REM), and nonREM (NREM) sleep percentages are automatically estimated from 
      physiological (ECG and respiration) and behavioral (Actigraphy) nocturnal data. Two 
      methods are described; the first deals with the problem of the hypnogram estimation 
      and the second is specifically designed to compute the sleep parameters, 
      outperforming the traditional estimation approach based on the hypnogram. Using an 
      extended set of features the first method achieves an accuracy of 72.8%, 77.4%, and 
      80.3% in the detection of wakefulness, REM, and NREM states, respectively, and the 
      second an estimation error of 4.3%, 9.8%, and 5.4% for the SE, REM, and NREM 
      percentages, respectively.

AB  - The main purpose of this paper is to study the influence of the mechanical effect of 
      respiration over the T-wave end delineation. We compared the performance of an 
      automatic delineation system based on the wavelet transform (WT), considering single 
      lead (SL), global delineation locations obtained from SL annotations (SLR), and 
      multilead (ML) approaches. The linear relation between the variations on T-wave end 
      locations obtained with each of the methods and the mechanical effect of respiration 
      was quantified using spectral coherence and ARARX modeling both in simulated signals 
      and in real data. We also explored the evolution of the vectorcardiographic spatial 
      loop using the projection on the main direction of the WT in the region close to the 
      T-wave end ( T(e)) and its relation with respiration. The dispersion of the 
      additional T-wave end location error due to respiration was reduced by 15% using SLR 
      with respect to SL, while ML allows for a reduction of around 40%. The percentage of 
      that error correlated with respiration was in average 99% using SL while 82% and 72% 
      using SLR and ML, respectively. Thus, results suggest that ML is the most adequate 
      strategy for T-wave delineation, allowing the reduction of the instability of T-wave 
      end location caused by respiration.

AB  - Objective: Seizure-related autonomic dysregulation occurs in epilepsy patients and 
      may contribute to Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP). We tested how 
      different types of seizures affect baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) and heart rate 
      variability (HRV). We hypothesized that BRS and HRV would be reduced after bilateral 
      convulsive seizures (BCS). Methods: We recorded blood pressure (BP), 
      electrocardiogram (ECG) and oxygen saturation continuously in patients (n = 18) with 
      intractable epilepsy undergoing video-EEG monitoring. A total of 23 seizures, either 
      focal seizures (FS, n = 14) or BCS (n = 9), were analyzed from these patients. We 
      used 5 different HRV measurements in both the time and frequency domains to study 
      HRV in pre- and post-ictal states. We used the average frequency domain gain, 
      computed as the average of the magnitude ratio between the systolic BP (BPsys) and 
      the RR-interval time series, in the low-frequency (LF) band as frequency domain 
      index of BRS in addition to the instantaneous slope between systolic BP and 
      RR-interval satisfying spontaneous BRS criteria as a time domain index of BRS. 
      Results: Overall, the post-ictal modulation of HRV varied across the subjects but 
      not specifically by the type of seizures. Comparing pre- to post-ictal epochs, the 
      LF power of BRS decreased in 8 of 9 seizures for patients with BCS; whereas 
      following 12 of 14 FS, BRS increased. Similarly, spontaneous BRS decreased following 
      7 of 9 BCS. The presence or absence of oxygen desaturation was not consistent with 
      the changes in BRS following seizures, and the HRV does not appear to be correlated 
      with the BRS changes. These data suggest that a transient decrease in BRS and 
      temporary loss of cardiovascular homeostatic control can follow BCS but is unlikely 
      following FS. Significance: These findings indicate significant post-ictal autonomic 
      dysregulation in patients with epilepsy following BCS. Further, reduced BRS 
      following BCS, if confirmed in future studies on SUDEP cases, may indicate one 
      quantifiable risk marker of SUDEP.

TI  - Assessing the severity of sleep apnea syndrome based on ballistocardiogram.
PG  - e0175351
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0175351 [doi]
LID - e0175351
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sleep Apnea Syndrome (SAS) is a common sleep-related breathing disorder, 
      which affects about 4-7% males and 2-4% females all around the world. Different 
      approaches have been adopted to diagnose SAS and measure its severity, including the 
      gold standard Polysomnography (PSG) in sleep study field as well as several 
      alternative techniques such as single-channel ECG, pulse oximeter and so on. 
      However, many shortcomings still limit their generalization in home environment. In 
      this study, we aim to propose an efficient approach to automatically assess the 
      severity of sleep apnea syndrome based on the ballistocardiogram (BCG) signal, which 
      is non-intrusive and suitable for in home environment. METHODS: We develop an 
      unobtrusive sleep monitoring system to capture the BCG signals, based on which we 
      put forward a three-stage sleep apnea syndrome severity assessment framework, i.e., 
      data preprocessing, sleep-related breathing events (SBEs) detection, and sleep apnea 
      syndrome severity evaluation. First, in the data preprocessing stage, to overcome 
      the limits of BCG signals (e.g., low precision and reliability), we utilize wavelet 
      decomposition to obtain the outline information of heartbeats, and apply a RR 
      correction algorithm to handle missing or spurious RR intervals. Afterwards, in the 
      event detection stage, we propose an automatic sleep-related breathing event 
      detection algorithm named Physio_ICSS based on the iterative cumulative sums of 
      squares (i.e., the ICSS algorithm), which is originally used to detect structural 
      breakpoints in a time series. In particular, to efficiently detect sleep-related 
      breathing events in the obtained time series of RR intervals, the proposed algorithm 
      not only explores the practical factors of sleep-related breathing events (e.g., the 
      limit of lasting duration and possible occurrence sleep stages) but also overcomes 
      the event segmentation issue (e.g., equal-length segmentation method might divide 
      one sleep-related breathing event into different fragments and lead to incorrect 
      results) of existing approaches. Finally, by fusing features extracted from multiple 
      domains, we can identify sleep-related breathing events and assess the severity 
      level of sleep apnea syndrome effectively. CONCLUSIONS: Experimental results on 136 
      individuals of different sleep apnea syndrome severities validate the effectiveness 
      of the proposed framework, with the accuracy of 94.12% (128/136).

TI  - Inclusion of signal analysis in a hybrid medical decision support system.
PG  - 79-82
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Signal analysis has played an important role in cardiac diagnosis, both 
      as a separate entity and in conjunction with clinical parameters. Hybrid systems are 
      an effective method for developing higher-order decision models in which biomedical 
      signal data can be incorporated. METHODS: The hybrid system components include a 
      knowledge-based system that utilizes approximate reasoning techniques, a neural 
      network model based on a potential function approach to supervised learning that 
      uses the general class of Cohen orthogonal functions as potential functions, and a 
      signal analysis component that relies on continuous chaotic modeling to produce a 
      degree of variability in the time series. The hybrid system is illustrated in an 
      application for differentiation among different types of dementia. RESULTS: 
      Application of this method to cardiac diagnosis shows that chaotic parameters alone 
      contribute significantly to correct classification while the addition of clinical 
      parameters increases the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. Applications to 
      electroencephalogram analysis indicate that the second-order difference plots 
      display significant differences for the different types of EEG waves identifiable by 
      frequency, both in shape and degree of dispersion. Hence the identification of these 
      waves, and the duration of their occurrence, may provide suitable variables for 
      chaotic analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Results from studies in cardiology demonstrate that 
      using chaotic measures for ECG analysis provide useful information for 
      classification. Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy are increased if these 
      methods are combined with other clinical parameters in a hybrid system. This 
      approach has been extended to new applications based on EEG analysis combined with 
      other relevant information.

TI  - [Microvolt T-wave alternans in adolescent elite athletes].
PG  - 43-6
AB  - Microvolt T-wave alternans (MTA) is one of markers of electrical myocardial 
      instability. STUDY AIM: To elucidate normal range of MTA parameters during bicycle 
      exercise test (ET) in adolescent elite athletes. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We examined 
      500 athletes aged 9-18 (mean 16.1 ± 2.2) years members of national teams of 27 kinds 
      of sport. There were 333 females with mean age 16.0 ± 1.01 years and 167 males with 
      mean age 16.3 ± 1.4. All athletes underwent ECG registration in clino- and ortho- 
      positions and bicycle ET with automatic analysis of MTAT-wave alternans. RESULTS: 
      Mean MTA value was 26 ± 13 (9-51) mV. MTA above 65 mV was registered in 10 persons 
      (2.1%) 5 of whom had signs of overtraining. Sensitivity (Se) of MTA for detection of 
      overtraining state was 21%, specificity (Sp)--99%, positive and negative predictive 
      value--50 and 96%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Normal MTA range during ET is 9-51 mV. 
      MTA values during ET do not depend on age and sex but are determined by duration of 
      participation in sports and myocardial mass. MTA value is related to length of 
      QT-interval. Increase of maximal MTA values above 65 mV is insensitive (Se 21%) but 
      highly specific (Sp 99%) sign of overtraining in adolescent elite athletes.

      paroxysmal, and may occur only during sleep or in association with mental, 
      emotional, or exercise-induced perturbation in cardiac function, AECG needs to be 
      recorded over a long period of time, originally lasting 24h and now expanding up to 
      several weeks and even to months. New technologies for continuous prolonged AECG 
      monitoring, and new algorithms for automatic arrhythmia detection and wireless data 
      transmission in near real-time, have significantly improved the ECG signals quality 
      for long-term recordings and the diagnostic yield for infrequent cardiac 
      arrhythmias. New wireless electrode systems, such as patches, vests or belts have 
      greatly increased the tolerability, quality and feasibility of prolonged AECG, which 
      is particularly useful for the diagnosis of infrequent symptoms, such as unexplained 
      syncope, palpitations or cryptogenic stroke.

TI  - Application of the phasor transform for automatic delineation of single-lead ECG 
      fiducial points.

LID - 10.1088/0967-3334/31/11/005 [doi]
AB  - This work introduces a new single-lead ECG delineator based on phasor transform. The 
      method is characterized by its robustness, low computational cost and mathematical 
      simplicity. It converts each instantaneous ECG sample into a phasor, and can 
      precisely manage P and T waves, which are of notably lower amplitude than the QRS 
      complex. The method has been validated making use of synthesized and real ECG sets, 
      including the MIT-BIH arrhythmia, QT, European ST-T and TWA Challenge 2008 
      databases. Experiments with the synthesized recordings reported precise detection 
      and delineation performances in a wide variety of ECGs, with signal-to-noise ratios 
      of 10 dB and above. For real ECGs, the QRS detection was characterized by an average 
      sensitivity of 99.81% and positive predictivity of 99.89%, for all the analyzed 
      databases (more than one million beats). Regarding delineation, the maximum 
      localization error between automatic and manual annotations was lower than 6 ms and 
      its standard deviation was in agreement with the accepted tolerances for expert 
      physicians in the onset and offset identification for QRS, P and T waves. 
      Furthermore, after revising and reannotating some ECG recordings by expert 
      cardiologists, the delineation error decreased notably, becoming lower than 3.5 ms, 
      on average, and reducing by a half its standard deviation. This new proposed 
      strategy outperforms the results provided by other well-known delineation algorithms 
      and, moreover, presents a notably lower computational cost.

LID - 41951
AB  - We construct temporal networks from time series via unfolding the temporal 
      information into an additional topological dimension of the networks. Thus, we are 
      able to introduce memory entropy analysis to unravel the memory effect within the 
      considered signal. We find distinct patterns in the entropy growth rate of the 
      aggregate network at different memory scales for time series with different dynamics 
      ranging from white noise, 1/f noise, autoregressive process, periodic to chaotic 
      dynamics. Interestingly, for a chaotic time series, an exponential scaling emerges 
      in the memory entropy analysis. We demonstrate that the memory exponent can 
      successfully characterize bifurcation phenomenon, and differentiate the human 
      cardiac system in healthy and pathological states. Moreover, we show that the 
      betweenness preference analysis of these temporal networks can further characterize 
      dynamical systems and separate distinct electrocardiogram recordings. Our work 
      explores the memory effect and betweenness preference in temporal networks 
      constructed from time series data, providing a new perspective to understand the 
      underlying dynamical systems.

AB  - The paper deals with ECG prediction based on neural networks classification of 
      different types of time courses of ECG signals. The main objective is to recognise 
      normal cycles and arrhythmias and perform further diagnosis. We proposed two 
      detection systems that have been created with usage of neural networks. The 
      experimental part makes it possible to load ECG signals, preprocess them, and 
      classify them into given classes. Outputs from the classifiers carry a predictive 
      character. All experimental results from both of the proposed classifiers are 
      mutually compared in the conclusion. We also experimented with the new method of 
      time series transparent prediction based on fuzzy transform with linguistic IF-THEN 
      rules. Preliminary results show interesting results based on the unique capability 
      of this approach bringing natural language interpretation of particular prediction, 
      that is, the properties of time series.

AB  - Accurate and fast approaches for automatic ECG data classification are vital for 
      clinical diagnosis of heart disease. To this end, we propose a novel multistage 
      algorithm that combines various procedures for dimensionality reduction, consensus 
      clustering of randomized samples and fast supervised classification algorithms for 
      processing of the highly dimensional large ECG datasets. We carried out extensive 
      experiments to study the effectiveness of the proposed multistage clustering and 
      classification scheme using precision, recall and F-measure metrics. We evaluated 
      the performance of numerous combinations of various methods for dimensionality 
      reduction, consensus functions and classification algorithms incorporated in our 
      multistage scheme. The results of the experiments demonstrate that the highest 
      precision, recall and F-measure are achieved by the combination of the rank 
      correlation coefficient for dimensionality reduction, HBGF consensus function and 
      the SMO classifier with the polynomial kernel.

TI  - Gaussian process robust regression for noisy heart rate data.
PG  - 2143-51
LID - 10.1109/TBME.2008.923118 [doi]
AB  - Heart rate data collected during nonlaboratory conditions present several 
      data-modeling challenges. First, the noise in such data is often poorly described by 
      a simple Gaussian; it has outliers and errors come in bursts. Second, in large-scale 
      studies the ECG waveform is usually not recorded in full, so one has to deal with 
      missing information. In this paper, we propose a robust postprocessing model for 
      such applications. Our model to infer the latent heart rate time series consists of 
      two main components: unsupervised clustering followed by Bayesian regression. The 
      clustering component uses auxiliary data to learn the structure of outliers and 
      noise bursts. The subsequent Gaussian process regression model uses the cluster 
      assignments as prior information and incorporates expert knowledge about the 
      physiology of the heart. We apply the method to a wide range of heart rate data and 
      obtain convincing predictions along with uncertainty estimates. In a quantitative 
      comparison with existing postprocessing methodology, our model achieves a 
      significant increase in performance.

TI  - De-noising the abdominal phonogram for foetal heart rate extraction: blind source 
      separation versus empirical filtering.
PG  - 1358-61
LID - 10.1109/EMBC.2013.6609761 [doi]
AB  - This work explored the suitability of using the foetal phonocardiogram (FPCG) 
      blindly separated from the abdominal phonogram as a source for foetal heart rate 
      (FHR) measuring in antenatal surveillance. To this end, and working on a dataset of 
      15 abdominal phonograms, the FPCG was estimated by using two de-noising approaches 
      (1) single-channel independent component analysis (SCICA) to produce FPCG(e) and (2) 
      empirical filtering to produce FPCG(g). Next, the FPCGs were further processed to 
      collect the beat-to-beat FHR and the resulting time-series (FCTG(e) and FCTG(g) were 
      compared to the reference signal given by the abdominal ECG (FCTG(r)). Results are 
      promising, the FPCG(e) gives rise to a FCTG(e) that resembles FCTG(r) and, most 
      importantly, whose mean FHR value is statistically equivalent to that given by 
      FCTG(r) (p > 0.05). Thus, the mean FHR value obtained from the FPCG(e), is likely to 
      be equivalent to the value given by the abdominal ECG, which is especially 
      significant since the FPCG(e) is retrieved from the noisy abdominal phonogram. 
      Hence, as far as this study has gone, it can be said that, when using SCICA to 
      de-noise the abdominal phonogram, the resulting FPCG is likely to become a useful 
      source for FHR collection in antenatal surveillance.

TI  - Quantal breathing frequency variation in halothane anaesthetised neonatal rats.
PG  - 147-53
AB  - We examined the changes in cardioventilatory synchronisation and breathing frequency 
      variability that occur during early postnatal development in anaesthetised rats. 
      Five-minute periods of heart rate and inspiratory timing data were recorded from 26 
      halothane anaesthetised, spontaneously breathing rats aged 2-14 days. The presence 
      of cardioventilatory synchronisation was determined by examining the timing 
      relationship between inspiratory onset and the preceding ECG R waves. We observed 
      synchronisation at all ages, and the degree of synchronisation present (measured as 
      the Shannon entropy of the interval between inspiration and the immediately 
      preceding R wave) did not correlate with age. Frequent apnoeas were observed in the 
      respiratory frequency time series. The duration of these apnoeas was close to either 
      one or two times the duration of the immediately preceding breath. We suggest that 
      these "dropped breaths" may be the consequence of a resetting of the respiratory 
      oscillator just prior to initiation of the breath, or a gating process beneath the 
      oscillator that intermittently blocks the mechanical initiation of breaths. Dropped 
      breaths were seen commonly in rats up to 11 days of age, but rarely in 11-14-day old 
      rats, and were not associated with the presence or absence of cardioventilatory 
      synchronisation.

TI  - Holter ECG for pacemaker/defibrillator carriers: what is its role in the era of 
      remote monitoring?
PG  - 1272-8
LID - 10.1136/heartjnl-2015-307614 [doi]
AB  - Nowadays several diagnostic tools are available to investigate cardiovascular 
      symptoms like palpitations, dizziness and syncope: ECG Holter (or ambulatory ECG, 
      AECG), external and implantable event/loop recorders. Despite this technological 
      burden, many diagnoses are still missed. In the meantime, we are facing an 
      increasing use of implantable devices for cardiac pacing/defibrillation (CIED), 
      which have rapidly evolved from simple pacing/shock boxes to devices including 
      several diagnostic features. However, these functions are not adequately exploited 
      in current clinical practice and several redundant diagnostic tests, like AECG, are 
      still prescribed to CIED carriers, leading to an increase of costs and a delay in 
      final diagnosis. This review is aimed at identifying the current role of AECG in 
      CIED carriers in view of this technological improvement. First, we will briefly 
      present the indications for AECG according to current guidelines. We will then 
      provide a direct comparison of the different diagnostic features provided by AECG 
      (and event/loop recorders) versus automatic diagnostic CIED to highlight the 
      respective pros and cons. This will serve to carefully discuss these indications in 
      view of the results of recent studies on CIED carriers, highlighting the need for 
      proper implantation and follow-up. Eventually, we will provide useful hints to 
      properly analyse AECG in CIED carriers, considering the different behaviours 
      according to the implemented algorithms. We will conclude by suggesting updated 
      indications for AECG.

TI  - An embedded reconfigurable architecture for patient-specific multi-paramater medical 
      monitoring.
PG  - 1896-900
LID - 10.1109/IEMBS.2011.6090537 [doi]
AB  - A robust medical monitoring device should be able to provide intelligent diagnosis 
      based on accurate analysis of physiological parameters in real-time. At the same 
      time, such device must be able to adapt to the characteristics of a specific patient 
      and desired diagnostic needs, and continue to operate even in presence of unexpected 
      artifacts and accidental errors. A reconfigurable architecture is proposed for 
      real-time assessment of individual's health status based on development of a 
      patient-specific health index and online analysis and fusion of multi-parameter 
      physiological signals. This is achieved by static configuration of processing 
      elements and communication blocks in the architecture based on the patient's 
      diagnostic needs. The proposed architecture is prototyped as a single integrated 
      device on an FPGA platform and is evaluated using multi-parameter data from 
      intensive care units (ICUs). Three representative test cases of concurrently 
      analyzing Blood Pressure, Heart Rate, and Electrocardiogram (ECG) data from MIMIC 
      database are presented. The results show the effectiveness of the proposed technique 
      in eliminating false alarms caused by patient movements, monitor noise, or 
      imperfections in the detection schemes.

TI  - Physiologic monitoring practices during pediatric procedural sedation: a report from 
      the Pediatric Sedation Research Consortium.
PG  - 990-8
LID - 10.1001/archpediatrics.2012.1023 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To describe the frequency of different physiologic monitoring modalities 
      and combinations of modalities used during pediatric procedural sedation; to 
      describe how physiologic monitoring varies among different classes of patients, 
      health care providers (ie, ranging from anesthesiologists to emergency medicine 
      physicians to nurse practitioners), procedures, and sedative medications employed; 
      and to determine the proportion of sedations meeting published guidelines for 
      physiologic monitoring. DESIGN This was a prospective, observational study from 
      September 1, 2007, through March 31, 2011. SETTING: Data were collected in areas 
      outside of the operating room, such as intensive care units, radiology, emergency 
      departments, and clinics. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-seven institutions comprise the 
      Pediatric Sedation Research Consortium that prospectively collects data on 
      procedural sedation/anesthesia performed outside of the operating room in all 
      children up to age 21 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Data including demographics, 
      procedure performed, provider level, adverse events, medications, and physiologic 
      monitors used are entered into a web-based system. RESULTS: Data from 114 855 
      subjects were collected and analyzed. The frequency of use of each physiologic 
      monitoring modality by health care provider type, medication used, and procedure 
      performed varied significantly. The largest difference in frequency of monitoring 
      use was seen between providers using electrocardiography (13%-95%); the smallest 
      overall differences were seen in monitoring use based on the American Society of 
      Anesthesiologists classifications (1%-10%). Guidelines published by the American 
      Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of Emergency Physicians, and the 
      American Society of Anesthesiologists for nonanesthesiologists were adhered to for 
      52% of subjects. CONCLUSIONS: A large degree of variability exists in the use of 
      physiologic monitoring modalities for pediatric procedural sedation. Differences in 
      monitoring are evident between sedation providers, medications, procedures, and 
      patient types.

TI  - Using DWT for ECG motion artifact reduction with noise-correlating signals.
PG  - 4804-7
LID - 10.1109/IEMBS.2011.6091190 [doi]
AB  - Dealing with motion artifacts in long-term ECG recordings is a big issue. The 
      frequency spectrum of motion artifacts is similar to the frequencies of the QRS 
      complex--the wanted signal in the ECG. The deletion of motion artifacts often leads 
      to a deformation of QRS complexes, too. These risks can be minimized by using a 
      noise-correlating signal as a second channel for artifact reduction. This paper 
      presents an approach using the electrode-skin impedance as a second channel for the 
      reduction of motion artifacts. Using the discrete wavelet transform, motion 
      artifacts can be deleted time and frequency selective. This filter approach leads to 
      an improvement of the automatic QRS detection and decreases the number of false 
      detections by 35 %.

LID - 10.3390/s140202012 [doi]
AB  - The correct choice and customization of an orthosis are crucial to obtain the best 
      comfort and efficiency. This study explored the feasibility of a multivariate 
      quantitative assessment of the functional efficiency of lower limb orthosis through 
      a novel wearable system. Gait basographic parameters and energetic indexes were 
      analysed during a Six-Minute Walking Test (6-MWT) through a cost-effective, 
      non-invasive polygraph device, with a multichannel wireless transmission, that 
      carried out electro-cardiograph (ECG); impedance-cardiograph (ICG); and lower-limb 
      accelerations detection. Four subjects affected by Post-Polio Syndrome (PPS) were 
      recruited. The wearable device and the semi-automatic post-processing software 
      provided a novel set of objective data to assess the overall efficiency of the 
      patient-orthosis system. Despite the small number of examined subjects, the results 
      obtained with this new approach encourage the application of the method thus 
      enlarging the dataset to validate this promising protocol and measuring system in 
      supporting clinical decisions and out of a laboratory environment.

TI  - Suppression of ryanodine receptor function prolongs Ca2+ release refractoriness and 
      promotes cardiac alternans in intact hearts.
PG  - 3951-3964
AB  - Beat-to-beat alternations in the amplitude of the cytosolic Ca(2+) transient (Ca(2+) 
      alternans) are thought to be the primary cause of cardiac alternans that can lead to 
      cardiac arrhythmias and sudden death. Despite its important role in 
      arrhythmogenesis, the mechanism underlying Ca(2+) alternans remains poorly 
      understood. Here, we investigated the role of cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR2), the 
      major Ca(2+) release channel responsible for cytosolic Ca(2+) transients, in cardiac 
      alternans. Using a unique mouse model harboring a suppression-of-function (SOF) RyR2 
      mutation (E4872Q), we assessed the effect of genetically suppressing RyR2 function 
      on Ca(2+) and action potential duration (APD) alternans in intact hearts, and 
      electrocardiogram (ECG) alternans in vivo We found that RyR2-SOF hearts displayed 
      prolonged sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) release refractoriness and enhanced 
      propensity for Ca(2+) alternans. RyR2-SOF hearts/mice also exhibited increased 
      propensity for APD and ECG alternans. Caffeine, which enhances RyR2 activity and the 
      propensity for catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT), 
      suppressed Ca(2+) alternans in RyR2-SOF hearts, whereas carvedilol, a β-blocker that 
      suppresses RyR2 activity and CPVT, promoted Ca(2+) alternans in these hearts. Thus, 
      RyR2 function is an important determinant of Ca(2+), APD, and ECG alternans. Our 
      data also indicate that the activity of RyR2 influences the propensity for cardiac 
      alternans and CPVT in an opposite manner. Therefore, overly suppressing or enhancing 
      RyR2 function is pro-arrhythmic.

AB  - Interest in research involving health-medical information analysis based on 
      artificial intelligence, especially for deep learning techniques, has recently been 
      increasing. Most of the research in this field has been focused on searching for new 
      knowledge for predicting and diagnosing disease by revealing the relation between 
      disease and various information features of data. These features are extracted by 
      analyzing various clinical pathology data, such as EHR (electronic health records), 
      and academic literature using the techniques of data analysis, natural language 
      processing, etc. However, still needed are more research and interest in applying 
      the latest advanced artificial intelligence-based data analysis technique to 
      bio-signal data, which are continuous physiological records, such as EEG 
      (electroencephalography) and ECG (electrocardiogram). Unlike the other types of 
      data, applying deep learning to bio-signal data, which is in the form of time series 
      of real numbers, has many issues that need to be resolved in preprocessing, 
      learning, and analysis. Such issues include leaving feature selection, learning 
      parts that are black boxes, difficulties in recognizing and identifying effective 
      features, high computational complexities, etc. In this paper, to solve these 
      issues, we provide an encoding-based Wave2vec time series classifier model, which 
      combines signal-processing and deep learning-based natural language processing 
      techniques. To demonstrate its advantages, we provide the results of three 
      experiments conducted with EEG data of the University of California Irvine, which 
      are a real-world benchmark bio-signal dataset. After converting the bio-signals (in 
      the form of waves), which are a real number time series, into a sequence of symbols 
      or a sequence of wavelet patterns that are converted into symbols, through encoding, 
      the proposed model vectorizes the symbols by learning the sequence using deep 
      learning-based natural language processing. The models of each class can be 
      constructed through learning from the vectorized wavelet patterns and training data. 
      The implemented models can be used for prediction and diagnosis of diseases by 
      classifying the new data. The proposed method enhanced data readability and 
      intuition of feature selection and learning processes by converting the time series 
      of real number data into sequences of symbols. In addition, it facilitates intuitive 
      and easy recognition, and identification of influential patterns. Furthermore, 
      real-time large-capacity data analysis is facilitated, which is essential in the 
      development of real-time analysis diagnosis systems, by drastically reducing the 
      complexity of calculation without deterioration of analysis performance by data 
      simplification through the encoding process.

TI  - Automatic QRS Selvester scoring system in patients with left bundle branch block.
PG  - 308-14
LID - 10.1093/europace/euv040 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: The Selvester QRS scoring system uses quantitative criteria from the standard 
      12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) to estimate the myocardial scar size of patients, 
      including those with left bundle branch block (LBBB). Automation of the scoring 
      system could facilitate the clinical use of this technique which requires a set of 
      multiple QRS patterns to be identified and measured. METHODS AND RESULTS: We 
      developed a series of algorithms to automatically detect and measure the QRS 
      parameters required for Selvester scoring. The 'QUantitative and Automatic REport of 
      Selvester Score' was designed specifically for the analysis of ECGs from patients 
      meeting new strict criteria for complete LBBB. The algorithms were designed using a 
      training (n = 36) and a validation (n = 180) set of ECGs, consisting of 
      signal-averaged 12-lead ECGs (1000 Hz sampling) recorded from 216 LBBB patients from 
      the MADIT-CRT. We assessed the performance of the methods using expert manually 
      adjudicated ECGs. The average of absolute differences between automatic and 
      adjudicated Selvester scoring was 1.2 ± 1.5 points. The range of average differences 
      for continuous measurements of wave locations and interval durations varied between 
      0 and 6 ms. Erroneous detection of Q, R, S, R', and S' waves (oversensed or missed) 
      were 3, 1, 1, 16, and 6%, respectively. Seven percent of notches detected in the 
      first 40 ms were misdetected. CONCLUSION: We propose an efficient computerized 
      method for the automatic measurement of the Selvester score in patients with the 
      strict LBBB.

TI  - REM sleep estimation based on autonomic dynamics using R-R intervals.
PG  - 631-651
LID - 10.1088/1361-6579/aa63c9 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We developed an automatic algorithm to determine rapid eye movement (REM) 
      sleep on the basis of the autonomic activities reflected in heart rate variations. 
      APPROACH: The heart rate variability (HRV) parameters were calculated using the R-R 
      intervals from an electrocardiogram (ECG). A major autonomic variation associated 
      with the sleep cycle was extracted from a combination of the obtained parameters. 
      REM sleep was determined with an adaptive threshold applied to the acquired feature. 
      The algorithm was optimized with the data from 26 healthy subjects and obstructive 
      sleep apnea (OSA) patients and was validated with data from a separate group of 25 
      healthy and OSA subjects. MAIN RESULTS: According to an epoch-by-epoch (30 s) 
      analysis, the average of Cohen's kappa and the accuracy were respectively 0.63 and 
      87% for the training set and 0.61 and 87% for the validation set. In addition, the 
      REM sleep-related information extracted from the results of the proposed method 
      revealed a significant correlation with those from polysomnography (PSG). 
      SIGNIFICANCE: The current algorithm only using R-R intervals can be applied to 
      mobile and wearable devices that acquire heart-rate-related signals; therefore, it 
      is appropriate for sleep monitoring in the home and ambulatory environments. 
      Further, long-term sleep monitoring could provide useful information to clinicians 
      and patients for the diagnosis and treatments of sleep-related disorders and 
      individual health care.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To test the hypothesis that instituting a process of routine daily 
      review of rhythm alarms in non-cardiac patients in the pediatric intensive care unit 
      would yield clinically important disturbances that would otherwise go undetected. 
      STUDY DESIGN: A prospective observational study was performed over a consecutive 
      28-day period. Total bedside monitor alarms, rhythm alarms, and heart rate (HR) 
      trends were recorded. Rhythm alarm recordings were reviewed independently by two 
      study team members. Medical records for patients with critical arrhythmias were 
      reviewed to evaluate for prior knowledge of the event and to correlate with clinical 
      data. RESULTS: We evaluated 86 patients (343 patient-days). There were 54,656 total 
      monitor alarms (159.3 alarms/patient-day), of which 19,970 (37%) were rhythm alarms, 
      including 4032 (20%) critical arrhythmias. Fifty-six percent of the critical alarms 
      were artifactual. Seventeen of the 1786 ventricular tachycardia alarms represented 
      true episodes that occurred in 5 patients. Two patients' care were altered as a 
      result of detection of the arrhythmia in the review process. Eight hundred 
      sixty-five (98%) of the 883 true critical alarms reviewed were for extreme HR. 
      Eighty-three percent (5172) of the 6239 true non-critical alarms reviewed were HR 
      alarms. CONCLUSIONS: Daily review of rhythm alarms improves detection of clinically 
      relevant arrhythmias in non-cardiac pediatric intensive care unit patients.

AB  - Electrocardiographic imaging (ECG imaging) is a method to depict 
      electrophysiological processes in the heart. It is an emerging technology with the 
      potential of making the therapy of cardiac arrhythmia less invasive, less expensive, 
      and more precise. A major challenge for integrating the method into clinical 
      workflow is the seamless and correct identification and localization of electrodes 
      on the thorax and their assignment to recorded channels. This work proposes a 
      camera-based system, which can localize all electrode positions at once and to an 
      accuracy of approximately 1 ± 1 mm. A system for automatic identification of 
      individual electrodes is implemented that overcomes the need of manual annotation. 
      For this purpose, a system of markers is suggested, which facilitates a precise 
      localization to subpixel accuracy and robust identification using an 
      error-correcting code. The accuracy of the presented system in identifying and 
      localizing electrodes is validated in a phantom study. Its overall capability is 
      demonstrated in a clinical scenario.

TI  - Automatic microvolt T-wave alternans identification in relation to ECG interferences 
      surviving preprocessing.
PG  - 17-30
LID - 10.1016/j.medengphy.2010.08.014 [doi]
AB  - The aim was to investigate the effect of interferences surviving preprocessing 
      (residual noise, baseline wanderings, respiration modulation, replaced beats, missed 
      beats and T-waves misalignment) on automatic identification of T-wave alternans 
      (TWA), an ECG index of risk for sudden cardiac death. The procedures denominated 
      fast-Fourier-transform spectral method (FFTSM), complex-demodulation method (CDM), 
      modified-moving-average method (MMAM), Laplacian-likelihood-ratio method (LLRM), and 
      adaptive-match-filter method (AMFM) were applied to interferences-corrupted 
      synthetic ECG tracings and Holter ECG recordings from control-healthy subjects 
      (CH-group; n=25) and acute-myocardial-infarction patients (AMI group; n=25). The 
      presence of interferences in simulated data caused detection of false-positive TWA 
      by all techniques but the FFTSM and AMFM. Clinical applications evidenced a 
      discrepancy in that the FFTSM and LLRM detected no more than one TWA case in each 
      population, whereas the CDM, MMAM, and AMFM detected TWA in all CH-subjects and 
      AMI-patients, with significantly lower TWA amplitude in the former group. Because 
      the AMFM is not prone to false-positive TWA detections, the latter finding suggests 
      TWA as a phenomenon having continuously changing amplitude from physiological to 
      pathological conditions. Only occasional detection of TWA by the FFTSM and LLRM in 
      clinics can be ascribed to their limited ability in identifying TWA in the presence 
      of interferences surviving preprocessing.

TI  - On the Design of an Efficient Cardiac Health Monitoring System Through Combined 
      Analysis of ECG and SCG Signals.
LID - 10.3390/s18020379 [doi]
LID - 379
AB  - Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major public concern and socioeconomic problem 
      across the globe. The popular high-end cardiac health monitoring systems such as 
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computerized tomography scan (CT scan), and 
      echocardiography (Echo) are highly expensive and do not support long-term continuous 
      monitoring of patients without disrupting their activities of daily living (ADL). In 
      this paper, the continuous and non-invasive cardiac health monitoring using 
      unobtrusive sensors is explored aiming to provide a feasible and low-cost 
      alternative to foresee possible cardiac anomalies in an early stage. It is learned 
      that cardiac health monitoring based on sole usage of electrocardiogram (ECG) 
      signals may not provide powerful insights as ECG provides shallow information on 
      various cardiac activities in the form of electrical impulses only. Hence, a novel 
      low-cost, non-invasive seismocardiogram (SCG) signal along with ECG signals are 
      jointly investigated for the robust cardiac health monitoring. For this purpose, the 
      in-laboratory data collection model is designed for simultaneous acquisition of ECG 
      and SCG signals followed by mechanisms for the automatic delineation of relevant 
      feature points in acquired ECG and SCG signals. In addition, separate feature points 
      based novel approach is adopted to distinguish between normal and abnormal 
      morphology in each ECG and SCG cardiac cycle. Finally, a combined analysis of ECG 
      and SCG is carried out by designing a Naïve Bayes conditional probability model. 
      Experiments on Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved licensed ECG/SCG signals 
      acquired from real subjects containing 12,000 cardiac cycles show that the proposed 
      feature point delineation mechanisms and abnormal morphology detection methods 
      consistently perform well and give promising results. In addition, experimental 
      results show that the combined analysis of ECG and SCG signals provide more reliable 
      cardiac health monitoring compared to the standalone use of ECG and SCG.

AB  - A personal computer-based arrhythmia generator has been developed based upon 
      mathematical models of modulated parasystole and the related equations. A system of 
      nonlinear difference equations is used to generate the time series of RR intervals 
      of ECG that contain normal as well as ectopic QRS waves. The ECG waveform is 
      synthesized according to the computed RR interval and the type of QRS wave and 
      output via DA converter in a real-time base. Various types of ECGs with ventricular 
      ectopic beats and those with very long periods were generated by selecting values 
      for a small number of model parameters. This method requires neither large RAM nor 
      external memory for storing a library of arrhythmic ECGs. The theory, hardware 
      design, software implementation on a personal computer, and experimental 
      reconstruction of clinical ECGs based on the model are discussed.

LID - 10.1109/TITB.2010.2091648 [doi]
AB  - In this paper, a methodology is described in order to investigate the performance of 
      empirical mode decomposition (EMD) in biomedical signals, and especially in the case 
      of electrocardiogram (ECG). Synthetic ECG signals corrupted with white Gaussian 
      noise are employed and time series of various lengths are processed with EMD in 
      order to extract the intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). A statistical significance 
      test is implemented for the identification of IMFs with high-level noise components 
      and their exclusion from denoising procedures. Simulation campaign results reveal 
      that a decrease of processing time is accomplished with the introduction of 
      preprocessing stage, prior to the application of EMD in biomedical time series. 
      Furthermore, the variation in the number of IMFs according to the type of the 
      preprocessing stage is studied as a function of SNR and time-series length. The 
      application of the methodology in MIT-BIH ECG records is also presented in order to 
      verify the findings in real ECG signals.

TI  - Myocardial Infarction Detection Based on Multi-lead Ensemble Neural Network.
PG  - 2614-2617
LID - 10.1109/EMBC.2019.8856392 [doi]
AB  - Automatic myocardial infarction (MI) detection using an electrocardiogram (ECG) is 
      of great significance for improving the survival rate of patients. In this study, we 
      propose a multi-lead ensemble neural network (MENN) to distinguish anterior 
      myocardial infarction (AMI) and inferior myocardial infarction (IMI) from healthy 
      control (HC) respectively. In the study, three kinds of sub-networks and multi-lead 
      ECG signals are combined, which fully explores the information of ECG signals and 
      improves the classification performance. The algorithm is evaluated on the PTB 
      database by 5-fold inter-subject cross-validation and the sensitivity (Se), 
      specificity (Sp) and area under the curve (AUC) of AMI detection are 98.35%, 97.49%, 
      97.92%; The Se, Sp, and AUC of IMI detection are 93.17%, 92.02%, 92.60%. The 
      proposed method achieves the state of the art results on both tasks and outperforms 
      the baseline methods. Hence, the proposed method is potential for automatic MI 
      diagnosis.

TI  - Image quality and radiation exposure of coronary CT angiography in patients after 
      coronary artery bypass graft surgery: influence of imaging direction with 64-slice 
      dual-source CT.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The evaluation of native coronary arteries (NCAs) as well as coronary 
      artery bypass graft (CABG) patency after surgery is essential. However, NCAs are 
      often blurred in the craniocaudal scan direction because of long scan time with 
      64-slice CT. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the study was to determine the effect of scan 
      direction on image quality and radiation exposure in assessment of NCAs and CABGs. 
      METHODS: Retrospective analysis of 191 consecutive individuals undergoing coronary 
      CT angiography to evaluate CABG patency using 64-slice dual source CT. A 
      retrospectively ECG gated spiral acquisition protocol with ECG based tube current 
      modulation and automatic adjustment of tube current to a reference of 320 mAs 
      ("CareDose 4D") was used. Tube current was 120 kVp. Scan direction was either 
      cranio-caudal (CRC, n = 98) or caudo-cranial (CRC, n = 93) and the scan volume 
      covered the entire course of all bypass grafts. Independent investigators determined 
      quantitative image quality of the coronary arteries by evaluating contrast-to-noise 
      ratio (CNR), radiation exposure by comparing the effective dose, and qualitative 
      image quality through a 5 point rating scale. RESULTS: Quantitative image quality 
      was not significantly different for the two groups except for the CNR of the right 
      coronary artery which was significantly higher in patients with caudio-cranial scan 
      direction (P = .0007). The qualitative image quality of the CaC group also was 
      better for both NCAs and CABGs (P = .002 for NCAs and <.001 for CABGs), mostly 
      because of the lower frequency of respiration artifacts on coronary arteries of the 
      CaC group (P = .005). As an effect of automatic tube current adjustment, radiation 
      dose was lower in patients with caudo-cranial scan direction (6.8 mSv vs. 9.6 mSv, p 
      < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: In patients with coronary bypass grafts imaged by 64-slice 
      dual source CT with spiral acquisition and automated tube current adjustment, a 
      caudo-cranial scan direction results in improved image quality and reduced radiation 
      exposure.

AB  - Objective. The aim of the study was to develop a complex electrophysiological 
      measurement system (hardware and software) which uses the methods of 
      electrophysiology and provides significant information about the intrauterine status 
      of the fetus, intending to obtain true-to-form, morphologically evaluated fetal ECG 
      from transabdominal maternal lead. Results. The present method contains many novel 
      ideas that allow creating true-to-form noninvasive fetal ECG in the third trimester 
      of the pregnancy in 80% of the cases. Such ideas are the telemetric data collection, 
      the "cleanse" of the real time recording from the maternal ECG, and the use of the 
      cardiotocograph (CTG) that allows identifying the fetal heart events. The advantage 
      of this developed system is that it does not require any qualified staff, because 
      both the extraction of the information from the abdominal recording and the 
      processing of the data are automatic. Discussion. Although the idea of a noninvasive 
      fetal electrocardiography is more than 100 years old still there is no simple, 
      effective, and cheap method available that would enable an extensive use. This 
      developed system can be used in the third trimester of the pregnancy efficiently. It 
      can produce true-to-form fetal ECGs with amplitude less than 10 µV.

TI  - A Novel CNN-Based Framework for Classification of Signal Quality and Sleep Position 
      from a Capacitive ECG Measurement.
LID - 10.3390/s19071731 [doi]
LID - 1731
AB  - The further exploration of the capacitive ECG (cECG) is hindered by frequent 
      fluctuations in signal quality from body movement and changes in sleep position. The 
      processing framework must be fundamentally adapted to make full use of this signal. 
      Therefore, we propose a new signal-processing framework that determines the signal 
      quality for short signal segments (2 and 4 seconds) using a multi-class 
      classification model (qua_model) based on a convolutional neural network (CNN). We 
      built another independent deep CNN classifier (pos_model) to classify the sleep 
      position. In the validation, 12 subjects were recruited for a 30-minute experiment, 
      which required the subjects to lie on a bed in different sleeping positions. The 
      short segments, classified as clear (C1 class) by the qua_model, were used to 
      determine sleep positions with the pos_model. In 10-fold cross-validation, the 
      qua_model for signals of 4-second length could recognize the signal of the C1 class 
      at a 0.99 precision and a 0.99 recall; the pos_model could recognize the supine 
      sleep position, the left, and right lateral sleep positions at a 0.99 averaged 
      precision and a 0.99 averaged recall. Given the amount of data accumulated per night 
      and the instability in the signal quality, this fully automatic processing framework 
      is indispensable for a personal healthcare system. Therefore, this study could serve 
      as an important step for cECG technique trying to explore the cECG for unconstrained 
      heart monitoring.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The paper presents a diagnostic algorithm for classifying cardiac 
      tachyarrhythmias for implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs). The main aim 
      was to develop an algorithm that could reduce the rate of occurrence of 
      inappropriate therapies, which are often observed in existing ICDs. To achieve low 
      energy consumption, which is a critical factor for implantable medical devices, very 
      low computational complexity of the algorithm was crucial. The study describes and 
      validates such an algorithm and estimates its clinical value. METHODOLOGY: The 
      algorithm was based on the heart rate variability (HRV) analysis. The input data for 
      our algorithm were: RR-interval (I), as extracted from raw intracardiac electrogram 
      (EGM), and in addition two other features of HRV called here onset (ONS) and 
      instability (INST). 6 diagnostic categories were considered: ventricular 
      fibrillation (VF), ventricular tachycardia (VT), sinus tachycardia (ST), detection 
      artifacts and irregularities (including extrasystoles) (DAI), atrial 
      tachyarrhythmias (ATF) and no tachycardia (i.e. normal sinus rhythm) (NT). The 
      initial set of fuzzy rules based on the distributions of I, ONS and INST in the 6 
      categories was optimized by means of a software tool for automatic rule assessment 
      using simulated annealing. A training data set with 74 EGM recordings was used 
      during optimization, and the algorithm was validated with a validation data set with 
      58 EGM recordings. Real life recordings stored in defibrillator memories were used. 
      Additionally the algorithm was tested on 2 sets of recordings from the PhysioBank 
      databases: MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database and MIT-BIH Supraventricular Arrhythmia 
      Database. A custom CMOS integrated circuit implementing the diagnostic algorithm was 
      designed in order to estimate the power consumption. A dedicated Web site, which 
      provides public online access to the algorithm, has been created and is available 
      for testing it. RESULTS: The total number of events in our training and validation 
      sets was 132. In total 57 shocks and 28 antitachycardia pacing (ATP) therapies were 
      delivered by ICDs. 25 out of 57 shocks were unjustified: 7 for ST, 12 for DAI, 6 for 
      ATF. Our fuzzy rule-based diagnostic algorithm correctly recognized all episodes of 
      VF and VT, except for one case where VT was recognized as VF. In four cases short 
      lasting, spontaneously ending VT episodes were not detected (in these cases no 
      therapy was needed and they were not detected by ICDs either). In other words, a 
      fuzzy logic algorithm driven ICD would deliver one unjustified shock and deliver 
      correct therapies in all other cases. In the tests, no adjustments of our algorithm 
      to individual patients were needed. The sensitivity and specificity calculated from 
      the results were 100% and 98%, respectively. In 126 ECG recordings from PhysioBank 
      (about 30min each) our algorithm incorrectly detected 4 episodes of VT, which should 
      rather be classified as fast supraventricular tachycardias. The estimated power 
      consumption of the dedicated integrated circuit implementing the algorithm was below 
      120nW. CONCLUSION: The paper presents a fuzzy logic-based control algorithm for ICD. 
      Its main advantages are: simplicity and ability to decrease the rate of occurrence 
      of inappropriate therapies. The algorithm can work in real time (i.e. update the 
      diagnosis after every RR-interval) with very limited computational resources.

TI  - Automated ECG Noise Detection and Classification System for Unsupervised Healthcare 
      Monitoring.
PG  - 722-732
LID - 10.1109/JBHI.2017.2686436 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Automatic detection and classification of noises can play a vital role in 
      the development of robust unsupervised electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis systems. 
      This paper proposes a novel unified framework for automatic detection, localization, 
      and classification of single and combined ECG noises. METHODS: The proposed 
      framework consists of the modified ensemble empirical mode decomposition (CEEMD), 
      the short-term temporal feature extraction, and the decision-rule-based noise 
      detection and classification. In the proposed framework, ECG signals are first 
      decomposed using the modified CEEMD algorithm for discriminating the ECG components 
      from the noises and artifacts. Then, the short-term temporal features such as 
      maximum absolute amplitude, number of zerocrossings, and local maximum peak 
      amplitude of the autocorelation function are computed from the extracted 
      high-frequency and low-frequency signals. Finally, a decision rule-based algorithm 
      is presented for detecting the presence of noises and classifying the processed ECG 
      signals into six signal groups: noise-free ECG, ECG+BW, ECG+MA, ECG+PLI, ECG+BW+PLI, 
      and ECG+BW+MA. RESULTS: The proposed framework is rigorously evaluated on five 
      benchmark ECG databases and the real-time ECG signals. The proposed framework 
      achieves an average sensitivity of 99.12%, specificity of 98.56%, and overall 
      accuracy of 98.90% in detecting the presence of noises. Classification results show 
      that the framework achieves an average sensitivity, positive predictivity, and 
      classification accuracy of 98.93%, 98.39%, and 97.38%, respectively. CONCLUSION: The 
      proposed framework not only achieves better noise detection and classification rates 
      than the current state-of-the-art methods but also accurately localizes short bursts 
      of noises with low endpoint delineation errors. SIGNIFICANCE: Extensive studies on 
      benchmark databases demonstrate that the proposed framework is more suitable for 
      reducing false alarm rates and selecting appropriate noise-specific denoising 
      techniques in automated ECG analysis applications.

TI  - [Time series analysis of abnormal heart beat signals].
PG  - 219-24
LID - 10.1007/s003990070019 [doi]
AB  - The variability of electric and magnetic signals from the heart during the 
      depolarization phase is investigated. A signal processing method is developed which 
      provides estimates for the beat-to-beat variability of the QRS-complex. The method 
      is based on the decomposition of the depolarization signal into bandpass signals by 
      means of the Morlet wavelet transform. The beat variability of the depolarization 
      signal is estimated by normalized variances of the envelope and instantaneous 
      frequency of bandpass signals. Time intervals of the bandpass filtered 
      depolarization signals having a high signal-to-noise ratio are selected by applying 
      an analysis based on phase statistics. The method was tested by experimental data 
      taken from ECG and MCG measurements of healthy persons and patients prone to 
      malignant ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF). Results 
      suggest that the calculated variance parameters permit the characterization of beat 
      variable depolarization signals and distinguish VT/VF patients from healthy persons. 
      The method developed can be used to obtain additional information concerning 
      abnormal heart signals which is attenuated when applying signal averaging.

TI  - ECG signal quality during arrhythmia and its application to false alarm reduction.
PG  - 1660-6
LID - 10.1109/TBME.2013.2240452 [doi]
AB  - An automated algorithm to assess electrocardiogram (ECG) quality for both normal and 
      abnormal rhythms is presented for false arrhythmia alarm suppression of intensive 
      care unit (ICU) monitors. A particular focus is given to the quality assessment of a 
      wide variety of arrhythmias. Data from three databases were used: the Physionet 
      Challenge 2011 dataset, the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database, and the MIMIC II database. 
      The quality of more than 33 000 single-lead 10 s ECG segments were manually assessed 
      and another 12 000 bad-quality single-lead ECG segments were generated using the 
      Physionet noise stress test database. Signal quality indices (SQIs) were derived 
      from the ECGs segments and used as the inputs to a support vector machine classifier 
      with a Gaussian kernel. This classifier was trained to estimate the quality of an 
      ECG segment. Classification accuracies of up to 99% on the training and test set 
      were obtained for normal sinus rhythm and up to 95% for arrhythmias, although 
      performance varied greatly depending on the type of rhythm. Additionally, the 
      association between 4050 ICU alarms from the MIMIC II database and the signal 
      quality, as evaluated by the classifier, was studied. Results suggest that the SQIs 
      should be rhythm specific and that the classifier should be trained for each rhythm 
      call independently. This would require a substantially increased set of labeled data 
      in order to train an accurate algorithm.

TI  - System for Collecting Biosignal Data from Multiple Patient Monitoring Systems.
PG  - 333-337
LID - 10.4258/hir.2017.23.4.333 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Biosignal data include important physiological information. For that 
      reason, many devices and systems have been developed, but there has not been enough 
      consideration of how to collect and integrate raw data from multiple systems. To 
      overcome this limitation, we have developed a system for collecting and integrating 
      biosignal data from two patient monitoring systems. METHODS: We developed an 
      interface to extract biosignal data from Nihon Kohden and Philips monitoring 
      systems. The Nihon Kohden system has a central server for the temporary storage of 
      raw waveform data, which can be requested using the HL7 protocol. However, the 
      Philips system used in our hospital cannot save raw waveform data. Therefore, our 
      system was connected to monitoring devices using the RS232 protocol. After 
      collection, the data were transformed and stored in a unified format. RESULTS: From 
      September 2016 to August 2017, we collected approximately 117 patient-years of 
      waveform data from 1,268 patients in 79 beds of five intensive care units. Because 
      the two systems use the same data storage format, the application software could be 
      run without compatibility issues. CONCLUSIONS: Our system collects biosignal data 
      from different systems in a unified format. The data collected by the system can be 
      used to develop algorithms or applications without the need to consider the source 
      of the data.

TI  - Prevalence of QT interval prolongation in patients admitted to cardiac care units 
      and frequency of subsequent administration of QT interval-prolonging drugs: a 
      prospective, observational study in a large urban academic medical center in the US.
PG  - 459-70
LID - 10.2165/11598160-000000000-00000 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiac arrest due to torsades de pointes (TdP) is a rare but 
      catastrophic event in hospitals. Patients admitted to cardiac units are at higher 
      risk of drug-induced QT interval prolongation and TdP, due to a preponderance of 
      risk factors. Few data exist regarding the prevalence of QT interval prolongation in 
      patients admitted to cardiac units or the frequency of administering QT 
      interval-prolonging drugs to patients presenting with QT interval prolongation. 
      OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of 
      Bazett's-corrected QT (QT(c)) interval prolongation upon admission to cardiac units 
      and the proportion of patients presenting with QT(c) interval prolongation who are 
      subsequently administered QT interval-prolonging drugs during hospitalization. 
      METHODS: This was a prospective, observational study conducted over a 1-year period 
      (October 2008-October 2009) in 1159 consecutive patients admitted to two cardiac 
      units in a large urban academic medical centre located in Indianapolis, IN, USA. 
      Patients were enrolled into the study at the time of admission to the hospital and 
      were followed daily during hospitalization. Exclusion criteria were age <18 years, 
      ECG rhythm of complete ventricular pacing, and patient designation as 'outpatient' 
      in a bed and/or duration of stay <24 hours. Data collected included demographic 
      information, past medical history, daily progress notes, medication administration 
      records, laboratory data, ECGs, telemetry monitoring strips and diagnostic reports. 
      All patients underwent continuous cardiac telemetry monitoring and/or had a baseline 
      12-lead ECG obtained within 4 hours of admission. QT intervals were determined 
      manually from lead II of 12-lead ECGs or from continuous lead II telemetry 
      monitoring strips. QT(c) interval prolongation was defined as ≥470 ms for males and 
      ≥480 ms for females. In both males and females, QT(c) interval >500 ms was 
      considered abnormally high. A medication was classified as QT interval-prolonging if 
      there were published data indicating that the drug causes QT interval prolongation 
      and/or TdP. Study endpoints were (i) prevalence of QT(c) interval prolongation upon 
      admission to the Cardiac Medical Critical Care Unit (CMCCU) or an Advanced Heart 
      Care Unit (AHCU); (ii) proportion of patients admitted to the CMCCU/AHCU with QT(c) 
      interval prolongation who subsequently were administered QT interval-prolonging 
      drugs during hospitalization; (iii) the proportion of these higher-risk patients in 
      whom TdP risk factor monitoring was performed; (iv) proportion of patients with 
      QT(c) interval prolongation who subsequently received QT-prolonging drugs and who 
      experienced further QT(c) interval prolongation. RESULTS: Of 1159 patients enrolled, 
      259 patients met exclusion criteria, resulting in a final sample size of 900 
      patients. PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: mean (± SD) age, 65 ± 15 years; female, 47%; 
      Caucasian, 70%. Admitting diagnoses: heart failure (22%), myocardial infarction 
      (16%), atrial fibrillation (9%), sudden cardiac arrest (3%). QT(c) interval 
      prolongation was present in 27.9% of patients on admission; 18.2% had QT(c) interval 
      >500 ms. Of 251 patients admitted with QT(c) interval prolongation, 87 (34.7%) were 
      subsequently administered QT interval-prolonging drugs. Of 166 patients admitted 
      with QT(c) interval >500 ms, 70 (42.2%) were subsequently administered QT 
      interval-prolonging drugs; additional QT(c) interval prolongation ≥60 ms occurred in 
      57.1% of these patients. CONCLUSIONS: QT(c) interval prolongation is common among 
      patients admitted to cardiac units. QT interval-prolonging drugs are commonly 
      prescribed to patients presenting with QT(c) interval prolongation.

TI  - Localization of origins of premature ventricular contraction in the whole ventricle 
      based on machine learning and automatic beat recognition from 12-lead ECG.
LID - 10.1088/1361-6579/ab86d7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The localization of origins of premature ventricular contraction (PVC) 
      is the key factor for the success of ablation of ventricular arrhythmias. Existing 
      methods rely heavily on manual extraction of PVC beats, which limits their 
      application to the automatic PVC recognition from long-term data recorded by ECG 
      monitors before and during operation. Besides, researches identifying PVC sources in 
      the whole ventricle have not been reported. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was 
      to validate the feasibility of localization of origins of PVC in the whole ventricle 
      and to explore an automatic algorithm for recognition of PVC beat based on long-term 
      12-lead ECG. METHODS: This study included 249 patients with spontaneous PVCs or 
      pacing-induced PVCs. A novel algorithm was used to automatically extract PVC beats 
      from massive original ECG data which were collected by different acquisition 
      devices. After clustering and labelling, 374 sample groups, with each containing 
      dozens to hundreds of PVC beats, formed the entire dataset of 11 categories which 
      correspond to 11 regions of PVC origins in the whole ventricle. To choose the best 
      classification model for current task, four machine learning methods, Support Vector 
      Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) and 
      Gaussian Navïe Bayes (GNB), were compared by randomly selecting 70% of the entire 
      dataset (sample groups = 257) for training and the remaining 30% (sample groups = 
      117) for testing. The average performance of each model was estimated by bootstrap 
      method using 1000 resampling trials. RESULTS: For PVC beat recognition, the achieved 
      testing accuracy, sensitivity and specificity is 97.6%, 98.3% and 96.7%, 
      respectively. For localization purpose, the achieved testing accuracy varies 
      slightly from 70.7% to 74.1% among four classifiers, and when neighboring regions 
      were combined, the testing rank accuracy is improved to a range of 91.5% to 93.2%. 
      CONCLUSION: The proposed algorithm can automatically recognize PVC beats and map 
      them to one of the 11 regions in the whole ventricle. Owing to the high accuracy of 
      PVC beat recognition and the capability to target the potential PVC origins in multi 
      regions, it is expected to be a predominant technique being used in clinical 
      settings to automatically analyze huge ECG data before and during operation so as to 
      replace the tedious manual identification.

AB  - Cardiovascular diseases are one of the most common causes of death; however, the 
      early detection of patients at high risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD) remains an 
      issue. The aim of this study was to analyze the cardio-vascular couplings based on 
      heart rate variability (HRV) and blood pressure variability (BPV) analyses in order 
      to introduce new indices for noninvasive risk stratification in idiopathic dilated 
      cardiomyopathy patients (IDC). High-resolution electrocardiogram (ECG) and 
      continuous noninvasive blood pressure (BP) signals were recorded in 91 IDC patients 
      and 49 healthy subjects (CON). The patients were stratified by their SCD risk as 
      high risk (IDC(HR)) when after two years the subject either died or suffered 
      life-threatening complications, and as low risk (IDC(LR)) when the subject remained 
      stable during this period. Values were extracted from ECG and BP signals, the 
      beat-to-beat interval, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and analyzed using 
      the segmented Poincaré plot analysis (SPPA), the high-resolution joint symbolic 
      dynamics (HRJSD) and the normalized short time partial directed coherence methods. 
      Support vector machine (SVM) models were built to classify these patients according 
      to SCD risk. IDC(HR) patients presented lowered HRV and increased BPV compared to 
      both IDC(LR) patients and the control subjects, suggesting a decrease in their vagal 
      activity and a compensation of sympathetic activity. Both, the cardio -systolic and 
      -diastolic coupling strength was stronger in high-risk patients when comparing with 
      low-risk patients. The cardio-systolic coupling analysis revealed that the systolic 
      influence on heart rate gets weaker as the risk increases. The SVM IDC(LR) vs. 
      IDC(HR) model achieved 98.9% accuracy with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.96. 
      The IDC and the CON groups obtained 93.6% and 0.94 accuracy and AUC, respectively. 
      To simulate a circumstance in which the original status of the subject is unknown, a 
      cascade model was built fusing the aforementioned models, and achieved 94.4% 
      accuracy. In conclusion, this study introduced a novel method for SCD risk 
      stratification for IDC patients based on new indices from coupling analysis and 
      non-linear HRV and BPV. We have uncovered some of the complex interactions within 
      the autonomic regulation in this type of patient.

TI  - A Survey of Heart Anomaly Detection Using Ambulatory Electrocardiogram (ECG).
LID - 10.3390/s20051461 [doi]
LID - 1461
AB  - Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the number one cause of death globally. An 
      estimated 17.9 million people die from CVDs each year, representing 31% of all 
      global deaths. Most cardiac patients require early detection and treatment. 
      Therefore, many products to monitor patient's heart conditions have been introduced 
      on the market. Most of these devices can record a patient's bio-metric signals both 
      in resting and in exercising situations. However, reading the massive amount of raw 
      electrocardiogram (ECG) signals from the sensors is very time-consuming. Automatic 
      anomaly detection for the ECG signals could act as an assistant for doctors to 
      diagnose a cardiac condition. This paper reviews the current state-of-the-art of 
      this technology discusses the pros and cons of the devices and algorithms found in 
      the literature and the possible research directions to develop the next generation 
      of ambulatory monitoring systems.

TI  - Heart rate and blood pressure control in obesity - how to detect early 
      dysregulation?
PG  - 337-45
LID - 10.1111/cpf.12234 [doi]
AB  - Obesity is accompanied by many severe complications including various cardiovascular 
      disorders. An impairment of cardiovascular control by autonomic nervous system could 
      be one of the possible links between obesity and cardiovascular complications 
      development. The aim of this study was to compare spontaneous heart rate and 
      systolic blood pressure oscillations reflecting cardiovascular autonomic control of 
      young obese subjects with normal control subjects by linear and nonlinear methods 
      and to find sensitive markers of early autonomic dysregulation. Continuous 
      recordings of beat-to-beat systolic blood pressure and RR intervals from ECG were 
      obtained from 40 obese subjects (25 female, age 14·2 [13·1-16·1] (median 
      [interquartile range]) years) and gender and age matched non-obese control subjects. 
      In addition to linear measures (time and frequency domain), we performed recurrence 
      quantification analysis (RQA) and multiscale entropy analysis for both signals. 
      While no significant differences in heart rate and systolic blood pressure dynamics 
      were detected by linear measures and MSE, analysis of recurrence plots from RR 
      intervals time series showed significant differences - indices trapping time and 
      maximal length of vertical from RQA were significantly higher in obese compared to 
      control group. We conclude that heart rate and blood pressure control by autonomic 
      nervous system in young obese subjects is relatively well preserved. However, novel 
      RQA-related measures are able to detect early subtle abnormalities in cardiac 
      autonomic control in obese subjects indicating decreased signal complexity.

TI  - Detecting atrial fibrillation from short single lead ECGs using statistical and 
      morphological features.
PG  - 064002
LID - 10.1088/1361-6579/aac552 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Point of care ECG devices can improve the early detection of atrial 
      fibrillation (AF). The efficiency of such devices depends on the capability of 
      automatic AF detection against normal sinus rhythm and other arrhythmias from a 
      short single lead ECG record in the presence of noise and artifacts. The objective 
      of this study was to develop an algorithm that classifies a short single lead ECG 
      record into 'Normal', 'AF', 'Other' and 'Noisy' classes, and identify the challenges 
      in developing such algorithms and potential mitigation steps. APPROACH: Rule-based 
      identification was used to detect lead inversion and records too noisy to be of 
      immediate use. A set of statistical and morphological features describing the rhythm 
      was then extracted, and support vector machine classifiers were used to classify 
      records into three classes: 'Normal', 'AF' or 'Other'. The algorithm was trained and 
      tested using 12 186 short single lead ECGs recorded on a point of care device made 
      available via the Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2017. MAIN RESULTS: The 
      algorithm achieved a sensitivity of 77.5%, a specificity of 97.9% and an accuracy of 
      96.1% in the detection of AF from a non-AF rhythm in a five-fold cross validation. 
      It achieved F1 measures of 89%, 78% and 67% for 'Normal', 'AF' and 'Other' classes, 
      respectively, when evaluated with a hidden test set. The overall challenge score was 
      78%. SIGNIFICANCE: Most existing algorithms can distinguish the AF rhythm from the 
      normal sinus rhythm when ECG recordings are clean and are obtained with multi-lead 
      systems, while their ability to discriminate against other arrhythmias and noise 
      remains largely unknown. This study proposes an algorithm that classifies a short 
      single lead ECG record from point of care devices into 'Normal', 'AF', 'Other' and 
      'Noisy' classes and discusses computational approaches to mitigate any unique 
      challenges such as lead inversion, low amplitude signals, noise and artifacts.

TI  - The analysis of heart rate variability in unrestrained rats. Validation of method 
      and results.
PG  - 197-213
AB  - An experimental setting and software were developed to evaluate cardiac autonomic 
      function in unrestrained rats. Subcutaneously implanted ECG electrodes and an 
      indwelling venous catheter were tunneled to a tail cuff in five rats. The ECG was 
      A/D converted at 1000 Hz. After peak detection, a time series of RR intervals was 
      obtained. Programs for the analysis of heart rate variability (HRV) were implemented 
      in LabVIEW. Statistical properties were determined in the time domain. After cubic 
      spline function curve fitting, resampling at 0.1 s and test for stationarity, power 
      spectral analysis was performed on sampled records of 30 min duration after applying 
      a sliding Hanning window (Welch method: 256 points (duration 25.6 s), 50% overlap 
      and 0.039 Hz resolution). Algorithms were tested with simulated signals consisting 
      of isolated frequency components, which were retrieved at their exact locations. 
      Physiological validation of the system was performed by, beta-adrenergic and 
      cholinergic blockade and by forced breathing at a fixed rate. Measurements were 
      performed on five unrestrained rats under basal conditions. Mean RR was 174.2 +/- 
      3.6 ms; S.D., 13.3 +/- 4.6 ms; rMSSD, 5.2 + /- 1.2 ms; pNN10, 3.5 +/- 1.9% and pNN5, 
      18.7 +/- 6.4%. Low (0.19-0.74 Hz) and high frequency (0.78-2.5 Hz) power were 
      determined (and also percent of low to total and high to total): 18.42 +/- 10.74 ms2 
      (22.9 +/- 6.5%) and 15.66 +/- 5.56 ms2 (19.9 +/- 2.7%), and the ratio low/high: 1.16 
      +/- 0.39. In conclusion, HRV analysis programs were developed and thoroughly tested 
      through simulations and in vivo, under basal conditions and after pharmacological 
      blockades. Using this software, HRV data from unrestrained rats were obtained.

AB  - This study is designed to investigate the feasibility of automatic sleep staging 
      using features only derived from electrocardiography (ECG) signal. The study was 
      carried out using the framework of hidden Markov models (HMMs). The mean, and SD 
      values of heart rates (HRs) computed from each 30-second epoch served as the 
      features. The two feature sequences were first detrended by ensemble empirical mode 
      decomposition (EEMD), formed as a two-dimensional feature vector, and then converted 
      into code vectors by vector quantization (VQ) method. The output VQ indexes were 
      utilized to estimate parameters for HMMs. The proposed model was tested and 
      evaluated on a group of healthy individuals using leave-one-out cross-validation. 
      The automatic sleep staging results were compared with PSG estimated ones. Results 
      showed accuracies of 82.2%, 76.0%, 76.1% and 85.5% for deep, light, REM and wake 
      sleep, respectively. The findings proved that HRs-based HMM approach is feasible for 
      automatic sleep staging and can pave a way for developing more efficient, robust, 
      and simple sleep staging system suitable for home application.

AB  - An electrocardiogram marker to detect patients who have paroxysmal atrial 
      fibrillation (PAF) is reported. The data set of ECG records made available by 
      PhysioNet for Cardiology Challenge 2001 was used. The method uses a filtered time 
      series with a frequency range between 3 and 9 Hz obtained from the electrocardiogram 
      record. Typically, frequencies observed when a patient is in atrial fibrillation and 
      atrial flutter is within this frequency range. Filtering was done using wavelets. 
      Thereafter, the temporal properties of this filtered time series are studied. The 
      temporal properties studied are the standard deviation, standard deviation of 
      successive differences, and the length of the ellipse in the Poincare plot. The 
      results indicate that these temporal properties of patients with PAF are depressed 
      compared to the healthy group. A marker based on these temporal properties shows 
      promise in detecting PAF when patients are in normal sinus rhythm. Results also show 
      that the values for these temporal properties for a patient with PAF show little 
      variation with time, and its measure is not dependent on the time of occurrence of a 
      PAF episode.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: For nonclinical drug development, it is optimal if safety pharmacology 
      and toxicology studies are performed in a model that reasonably represents the 
      patient the drug is intended to treat. To simulate prolonged inhalation therapy in 
      ventilated patients, GLP inhalation toxicology methods, including safety 
      pharmacology endpoints, in anesthetized, intubated and mechanically ventilated dogs 
      were developed. This model required establishment of a canine intensive care unit 
      (ICU) capable of providing prolonged anesthesia (propofol infusion and morphine 
      titration) and partial parenteral nutrition (dextrose, amino acids and lipids) while 
      safety parameters were monitored. METHOD: Telemetry was used to continuously monitor 
      heart rate, ECG and blood pressure. Blood gas parameters were periodically measured 
      while oxygen saturation and core temperature were reported continuously. Glucose was 
      measured hourly while other standard clinical pathology (hematology, coagulation, 
      clinical chemistry) samples were evaluated approximately every 12 h. Aerosols were 
      administered continuously over 48 h by inhalation using a mesh nebulizer (Aerogen 
      Solo) fed by a syringe pump into a humidified circuit of a critical care ventilator 
      (LTV® 1000) ending in an endotracheal tube placed in the trachea. Animals were 
      ventilated with pressure control ventilation targeting a respiratory minute volume 
      of 2.0-3.5 l per minute (LPM). Peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) was maintained 
      between 10 and 17 cm H(2)O and inspiratory time was set to 1 s with an 
      inspiratory:expiratory (I:E) ratio of 1:2. Ventilator parameters and anesthesia were 
      adjusted to maintain normal PaCO(2) levels and adequate sedation, respectively. 
      Novel methods were developed to determine dose and particle size in vitro as on-line 
      measurements were not feasible during in vivo aerosol delivery. RESULTS AND 
      DISCUSSION: Acceptable baseline measurements were established for all parameters 
      over the 48-h evaluation period, qualifying the method as appropriate for assessment 
      of GLP safety pharmacology and toxicology studies.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to Identify whether changes in heart rate 
      variability (HRV) could be detected as critical illness resolves by comparing HRV 
      from the time of pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) admission with HRV immediately 
      prior to discharge. We also sought to demonstrate that HRV derived from 
      electrocardiogram (ECG) data from bedside monitors can be calculated in 
      critically-ill children using a real-time, streaming analytics platform. METHODS: 
      This was a retrospective, observational pilot study of 17 children aged 0 to 18 
      years admitted to the PICU of a free-standing, academic children's hospital. Three 
      time-domain measures of HRV were calculated in real-time from bedside monitor ECG 
      data and stored for analysis. Measures included: root mean square of successive 
      differences between NN intervals (RMSSD), percent of successive NN interval 
      differences above 50 ms (pNN50), and the standard deviation of NN intervals (SDNN). 
      RESULTS: HRV values calculated from the first and last 24 hours of PICU stay were 
      analyzed. Mixed effects models demonstrated that all three measures of HRV were 
      significantly lower during the first 24 hours compared to the last 24 hours of PICU 
      admission (p<0.001 for all three measures). In models exploring the relationship 
      between time from admission and log HRV values, the predicted average HRV remained 
      consistently higher in the last 24 hours of PICU stay compared to the first 24 
      hours. CONCLUSION: HRV was significantly lower in the first 24 hours compared to the 
      24 hours preceding PICU discharge, after resolution of critical illness. This 
      demonstrates that it is feasible to detect changes in HRV using an automated, 
      streaming analytics platform. Continuous tracking of HRV may serve as a marker of 
      recovery in critically ill children.

TI  - In the kingdom of "tortelli" (ravioli-like pasta) plant poisoning is still a threat. 
      A case report of near-fatal poisoning from Digitalis Purpurea accidentally confused 
      with Borago Officinalis.
PG  - 353-357
AB  - A 58 years healthy old woman was admitted to the Emergency Department (ED) with 
      cardiac arrest due to ventricular fibrillation (VF). Appropriate cardiopulmonary 
      resuscitation (CPR), multiple DC shocks and oro-tracheal intubation (OTI) were 
      effective to induce recovery of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). After ROSC was 
      achieved, the electrocardiogram (ECG) showed an idio-ventricular rhythm with 
      atrioventricular dissociation. A transcutaneous pacing was hence applied and the 
      patient was administered with isoproterenol. Simultaneously, her husband was 
      evaluated in the ED for gastrointestinal symptoms occurred after assumption of 
      home-made "tortelli" (ravioli-like pasta) stuffed with cheese and leaves of a plant 
      which they supposed to be borage two days before admission. Borage, during the 
      non-flowering seasons, can be easily confused with foxglove (Digitalis spp.), and 
      this was the main clue to suspect poisoning. Both patients were given DigiFab®, a 
      sheep antibody fragment with high affinity for digoxin. The woman was then admitted 
      in intensive care unit (ICU), where a rapid clinical  improvement occurred, thus 
      allowing discharge in a few days. The husband was instead discharged from the ED 
      after clinical observation and ECG monitoring. In both cases, a significant plasma 
      concentration of digoxin could be measured.

TI  - Can heart rate variability parameters derived by a heart rate monitor differentiate 
      between atrial fibrillation and sinus rhythm?
PG  - 320
LID - 10.1186/s12917-018-1650-6 [doi]
LID - 320
AB  - BACKGROUND: Heart rate variability (HRV) parameters, and especially RMSSD (root mean 
      squared successive differences in RR interval), could distinguish atrial 
      fibrillation (AF) from sinus rhythm(SR) in horses, as was demonstrated in a previous 
      study. If heart rate monitors (HRM) automatically calculating RMSSD could also 
      distinguish AF from SR, they would be useful for the monitoring of AF recurrence. 
      The objective of the study was to assess whether RMSSD values obtained from a HRM 
      can differentiate AF from SR in horses. Furthermore, the impact of artifact 
      correction algorithms, integrated in the analyses software for HRV analyses was 
      evaluated. Fourteen horses presented for AF treatment were simultaneously equipped 
      with a HRM and an electrocardiogram (ECG). A two-minute recording at rest, walk and 
      trot, before and after cardioversion, was obtained. RR intervals used were those 
      determined automatically by the HRM and by the equine ECG analysis software, and 
      those obtained after manual correction of QRS detection within the ECG software. 
      RMSSD was calculated by the HRM software and by dedicated HRV software, using six 
      different artifact filters. Statistical analysis was performed using the Wilcoxon 
      signed-rank test and receiver operating curves. RESULTS: The HRM, which applies a 
      low level filter, produced high area under the curve (AUC) (> 0.9) and cut off 
      values with high sensitivity and specificity. Similar results were obtained for the 
      ECG, when low level artifact filtering was applied. When no artifact correction was 
      used during trotting, an important decrease in AUC (0.75) occurred. CONCLUSION: In 
      horses treated for AF, HRMs with automatic RMSSD calculations distinguish between AF 
      and SR. Such devices might be a useful aid to monitor for AF recurrence in horses.

TI  - Characterizing artifacts in RR stress test time series.
PG  - 692-695
LID - 10.1109/EMBC.2016.7590796 [doi]
AB  - Electrocardiographic stress test records have a lot of artifacts. In this paper we 
      explore a simple method to characterize the amount of artifacts present in 
      unprocessed RR stress test time series. Four time series classes were defined: Very 
      good lead, Good lead, Low quality lead and Useless lead. 65 ECG, 8 lead, records of 
      stress test series were analyzed. Firstly, RR-time series were annotated by two 
      experts. The automatic methodology is based on dividing the RR-time series in 
      non-overlapping windows. Each window is marked as noisy whenever it exceeds an 
      established standard deviation threshold (SDT). Series are classified according to 
      the percentage of windows that exceeds a given value, based upon the first manual 
      annotation. Different SDT were explored. Results show that SDT close to 20% (as a 
      percentage of the mean) provides the best results. The coincidence between 
      annotators classification is 70.77% whereas, the coincidence between the second 
      annotator and the automatic method providing the best matches is larger than 63%. 
      Leads classified as Very good leads and Good leads could be combined to improve 
      automatic heartbeat labeling.

AB  - In vitro surrogate models of human cardiac tissue hold great promise in disease 
      modeling, cardiotoxicity testing, and future applications in regenerative medicine. 
      However, the generation of engineered human cardiac constructs with tissue-like 
      functionality is currently thwarted by difficulties in achieving efficient 
      maturation at the cellular and/or tissular level. Here, we report on the design and 
      implementation of a platform for the production of engineered cardiac macrotissues 
      from human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs), which we term "CardioSlice." PSC-derived 
      cardiomyocytes, together with human fibroblasts, are seeded into large 3D porous 
      scaffolds and cultured using a parallelized perfusion bioreactor with custom-made 
      culture chambers. Continuous electrical stimulation for 2 weeks promotes 
      cardiomyocyte alignment and synchronization, and the emergence of cardiac 
      tissue-like properties. These include electrocardiogram-like signals that can be 
      readily measured on the surface of CardioSlice constructs, and a response to 
      proarrhythmic drugs that is predictive of their effect in human patients.

TI  - Quantitative analysis of heart rate variability in patients with absence epilepsy.
PG  - 25-9
LID - 10.4103/0028-3886.76852 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There are no studies quantifying the nature of autonomic changes in 
      absence epilepsy. Aims : We characterized the heart rate variability (HRV) during 
      pre-interictal epileptiform discharges (IED), IED and post-IED states in absence 
      epilepsy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Electroencephalogram (EEG) records with generalized 
      3-Hz spike-wave discharges in 8 patients (M: F: 3 : 5; mean age: 13.0 ± 2.5 years) 
      with absence epilepsy were identified and corresponding electrocardiogram (ECG) time 
      series were obtained. The time domain HRV measures were applied to pre-IED, IED and 
      post-IED simultaneous ECG tracing. RESULTS: There was slight tachycardia during the 
      IED phase (pre-IED: 90.15 ± 3.45 bpm, IED: 94.82 ± 4.63 bpm, P = 0.09) which 
      returned to baseline during the post-IED phase (post-IED: 89.65 ± 3.78 bpm). There 
      was significant decrease in the standard deviation of RR interval (pre-IED: 40.0 ± 
      4.15 ms, IED: 30.4 ± 4.19 ms, P = 0.032) and trend in reduction of triangular index 
      (pre-IED: 0.05 ± 0.01, IED: 0.04 ± 0.004, P = 0.08) during the IED phase when 
      compared to pre-IED phase. The percentage of RR intervals >50 ms was lower during 
      the IED phase and achieved significance when compared to post-IED phase (IED: 10.08 
      ± 4.89, post-IED: 18.74 ± 6.17, P = 0.050). While mean HR and RR interval 
      significantly correlated with the duration of IEDs, there was no significant 
      correlation between its duration with change in HRV parameters between the groups. 
      There was no significant difference in HRV parameters between patients with long 
      (>10s) and short (<10s) duration of IED. CONCLUSIONS: Transient increase in heart 
      rate during IED phase was noted in patients with absence epilepsy. Longer duration 
      of IED seems to be linked with significant tachycardia. While most HRV parameters 
      did not reach statistical significance, standard deviation of RR intervals and 
      triangular index was noted to be decreased during the IED phase and returns to 
      pre-IED levels after the episode.

TI  - Algorithm for the automatic computation of the modified Anderson-Wilkins acuteness 
      score of ischemia from the pre-hospital ECG in ST-segment elevation myocardial 
      infarction.
PG  - 97-101
LID - S0022-0736(16)30288-6 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jelectrocard.2016.11.005 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The acuteness score (based on the modified Anderson-Wilkins score) 
      estimates the acuteness of ischemia based on ST-segment, Q-wave and T-wave 
      measurements obtained from the electrocardiogram (ECG) in patients with ST Elevation 
      Myocardial Infarction (STEMI). The score (range 1 (least acute) to 4 (most acute)) 
      identifies patients with substantial myocardial salvage potential regardless of 
      patient reported symptom duration. However, due to the complexity of the score, it 
      is not used in clinical practice. Therefore, we aimed to develop a reliable 
      algorithm that automatically computes the acuteness score. METHODS: We scored 50 
      pre-hospital ECGs from STEMI patients, manually and by the automated algorithm. We 
      assessed the reliability test between the manual and automated algorithm by 
      interclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and Bland-Altman plot. RESULTS: The ICC was 
      0.84 (95% CI 0.72-0.91), P<0.0001. The mean difference between manual and automated 
      acuteness score was 0.17±0.66. In only two cases, there was a major disagreement 
      between the two scores. There was an excellent agreement between the scores for the 
      remaining 48 ECGs, all within the upper (1.46) and lower (-1.12) limits of 
      agreement. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, we have developed an automated algorithm for 
      measurement of the modified Anderson-Wilkins ECG acuteness score from the 
      pre-hospital ECG in STEMI patients. This automated algorithm is highly reliable, can 
      be applied in daily practice for research purposes and may be implemented in 
      commercial automated ECG analysis programs to achieve practical use for decision 
      support in the acute phase of STEMI.

TI  - Sample Entropy in Electrocardiogram During Atrial Fibrillation.
PG  - 49-57
AB  - BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is an arrhythmia commonly encountered in 
      clinical practice. There is a high risk of thromboembolism in patients with AF. 
      Nonlinear analyses such as electroencephalogram (EEG), electrocardiogram (ECG), and 
      respiratory movement have been used to quantify biological signals, and sample 
      entropy (SampEn) has been employed as a statistical measure to evaluate complex 
      systems. In this study, we examined the values of SampEn in ECG signals for patients 
      with and without AF to measure the regularity and complexity. METHODS: ECG signals 
      of lead II were recorded from 34 subjects without arrhythmia and 15 patients with 
      chronic AF in a supine position. The ECG signals were converted into time-series 
      data and SampEn was calculated. RESULTS: The SampEn values for the group without 
      arrhythmia were 0.252 ± 0.114 [time lag (τ) = 1] and 0.533 ± 0.163 (τ = 5), and 
      those for the chronic AF group were 0.392 ± 0.158 (τ = 1) and 0.759 ± 0.246 (τ = 5). 
      The values of SampEn were significantly higher in the group with chronic AF than in 
      the group without arrhythmia (P < 0.01 for τ = 1, P < 0.004 for τ = 5). The 
      constructed three-dimensional vectors were plotted in time-delayed three-dimensional 
      space. We used time lags of τ = 5 and τ = 1. The shape of the loops of the 
      three-dimensional space was better for τ = 5. CONCLUSION: The values of SampEn from 
      ECG for chronic AF patients were higher than for subjects without arrhythmia, 
      suggesting greater complexity for the time-series from chronic AF patients. SampEn 
      is considered a new index for evaluating complex systems in ECG.

TI  - Heart rate response to onset of exercise: evidence for enhanced cardiac sympathetic 
      activity in animals susceptible to ventricular fibrillation.
PG  - H429-35
AB  - A large heart rate (HR) increase at the onset of exercise has been linked to an 
      increased risk for adverse cardiovascular events, including cardiac death. However, 
      the relationship between changes in cardiac autonomic regulation induced by exercise 
      onset and the confirmed susceptibility to ventricular fibrillation (VF) has not been 
      established. Therefore, a retrospective analysis of the HR response to exercise 
      onset was made in mongrel dogs with healed myocardial infarctions that were either 
      susceptible (S, n = 131) or resistant (R, n = 114) to VF (induced by a 2-min 
      occlusion of the left circumflex artery during the last minute of exercise). The ECG 
      was recorded, and time series analysis of HR variability (vagal activity index, the 
      0.24-1.04-Hz frequency component of R-R interval variability) was measured before 
      and 30, 60, and 120 s after the onset of exercise (treadmill running). Exercise 
      elicited significantly (ANOVA, P < 0.0001) greater increases in HR in susceptible 
      dogs at all three times (e.g., at 60 s: R, 46.8 +/- 2.3 vs. S, 57.1 +/- 2.2 
      beats/min). However, the vagal activity index decreased to a similar extent in both 
      groups of dogs (at 60 s: R, -2.8 +/- 0.1 vs. S, -3.0 +/- 0.2 ln ms2). 
      Beta-adrenoceptor blockade (BB, propranolol 1.0 mg/kg iv) reduced the HR increase 
      and eliminated the differences noted between the groups [at 60 s: R (n = 26), 40.4 
      +/- 3.2 vs. S (n = 31), 37.5 +/- 2.4 beats/min]. After BB, exercise once again 
      elicited similar declines in vagal activity in both groups (at 60 s: R, -3.6 +/- 0.5 
      vs. S, -3.2 +/- 0.4 ln ms2). When considered together, these data suggest that at 
      the onset of exercise HR increases to a greater extent in animals prone to VF 
      compared with dogs resistant to this malignant arrhythmia due to an enhanced cardiac 
      sympathetic activation in the susceptible dogs.

TI  - A Feature Selection Method Based on Shapley Value to False Alarm Reduction in ICUs A 
      Genetic-Algorithm Approach.
PG  - 319-323
LID - 10.1109/EMBC.2018.8512266 [doi]
AB  - High false alarm rate in intensive care units (ICUs) has been identified as one of 
      the most critical medical challenges in recent years. This often results in 
      overwhelming the clinical staff by numerous false or unurgent alarms and decreasing 
      the quality of care through enhancing the probability of missing true alarms as well 
      as causing delirium, stress, sleep deprivation and depressed immune systems for 
      patients. One major cause of false alarms in clinical practice is that the collected 
      signals from different devices are processed individually to trigger an alarm, while 
      there exists a considerable chance that the signal collected from one device is 
      corrupted by noise or motion artifacts. In this paper, we propose a 
      low-computational complexity yet accurate game-theoretic feature selection method 
      which is based on a genetic algorithm that identifies the most informative 
      biomarkers across the signals collected from various monitoring devices and can 
      considerably reduce the rate of false alarms (1).

TI  - F-MARC: promoting the prevention and management of sudden cardiac arrest in 
      football.
PG  - 597-8
LID - 10.1136/bjsports-2015-094764 [doi]
AB  - Sudden cardiac death is the most common cause of unnatural death in football. To 
      prevent and urgently manage sudden cardiac arrest on the football field-of-play, 
      F-MARC (FIFA Medical and Research Centre) has been fully committed to a programme of 
      research, education, standardisation and practical implementation. This strategy has 
      detected football players at medical risk during mandatory precompetition medical 
      assessments. Additionally, FIFA has (1) sponsored internationally accepted 
      guidelines for the interpretation of an athlete's ECG, (2) developed 
      field-of-play-specific protocols for the recognition, response, resuscitation and 
      removal of a football player having sudden cardiac arrest and (3) introduced and 
      distributed the FIFA medical emergency bag which has already resulted in the 
      successful resuscitation of a football player who had a sudden cardiac arrest on the 
      field-of-play. Recently FIFA, in association with the Institute of Sports and 
      Preventive Medicine in Saarbrücken, Germany, established a worldwide Sudden Death 
      Registry with a view to documenting fatal events on the football field-of-play. 
      These activities by F-MARC are testimony to FIFA's continued commitment to 
      minimising sudden cardiac arrest while playing football.

TI  - Atrial fibrillation detection on compressed sensed ECG.
PG  - 1405-1425
LID - 10.1088/1361-6579/aa7652 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Compressive sensing (CS) approaches to electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis 
      provide efficient methods for real time encoding of cardiac activity. In doing so, 
      it is important to assess the downstream effect of the compression on any signal 
      processing and classification algorithms. CS is particularly suitable for low power 
      wearable devices, thanks to its low-complex digital or hardware implementation that 
      directly acquires a compressed version of the signal through random projections. In 
      this work, we evaluate the impact of CS compression on atrial fibrillation (AF) 
      detection accuracy. APPROACH: We compare schemes with data reconstruction based on 
      wavelet and Gaussian models, followed by a P&T-based identification of beat-to-beat 
      (RR) intervals on the MIT-BIH atrial fibrillation database. A state-of-the-art AF 
      detector is applied to the RR time series and the accuracy of the AF detector is 
      then evaluated under different levels of compression. We also consider a new beat 
      detection procedure which operates directly in the compressed domain, avoiding 
      costly signal reconstruction procedures. MAIN RESULTS: We demonstrate that for 
      compression ratios up to 30[Formula: see text] the AF detector applied to RR 
      intervals derived from the compressed signal exhibits results comparable to those 
      achieved when employing a standard QRS detector on the raw uncompressed signals, and 
      exhibits only a 2% accuracy drop at a compression ratio of 60%. We also show that 
      the Gaussian-based reconstruction approach is superior in terms of AF detection 
      accuracy, with a negligible drop in performance at a compression ratio  ⩽75%, 
      compared to a wavelet approach, which exhibited a significant drop in accuracy at a 
      compression ratio  ⩾65%. SIGNIFICANCE: The results suggest that CS should be 
      considered as a plausible methodology for both efficient real time ECG compression 
      (at moderate compression rates) and for offline analysis (at high compression 
      rates).

TI  - Bradycardias are associated with more severe effects on cerebral oxygenation in very 
      preterm infants than in late preterm infants.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Commonly the magnitude and frequency of bradycardia is underestimated in 
      the neonatal unit due to the long averaging time used in bedside oximeters. We aimed 
      to assess the frequency and severity of bradycardia in preterm infants using the 
      lowest averaging time (2 s) available on a clinical oximeter, compared with 
      bradycardia detected using electrocardiogram (ECG), and whether bradycardia severity 
      and postmenstrual age affected cerebral oxygenation. METHODS: Preterm infants 
      (10 M/9F) were studied longitudinally at 26-31 (very preterm) and 32-38 weeks (late 
      preterm) postmenstrual age. Heart rate falls calculated from ECG were used to 
      determine mild or moderate/severe (MS) bradycardias. Cerebral tissue oxygenation 
      index (TOI, %) was recorded and fractional tissue oxygen extraction (FTOE) 
      calculated. RESULTS: Of the 615 bradycardias scored using ECG criteria, 10% were not 
      detected by oximetry. TOI falls associated with bradycardias were greater for MS 
      bradycardias compared with Mild for both groups (p < 0.001 for both). The FTOE 
      associated with MS bradycardias was higher for the very preterm compared with the 
      late preterm group (p < 0.001). In very preterm infants 61% of MS and 35% Mild 
      bradycardias were associated with TOI nadirs below 55%. CONCLUSION: Even the most 
      sensitive oximeter setting underestimates bradycardias. The cerebral effect from 
      bradycardias in very preterm infants is more severe than in late preterm infants. 
      Even the mild bradycardias are associated with falls in cerebral oxygenation. 
      Routine NIRS monitoring of cerebral oxygenation in NICUs may increase staff 
      awareness for interventions to reduce the repetitive falls in cerebral oxygenation 
      in preterm infants.

AB  - Detection and real time monitoring of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) episodes are 
      very important tasks in healthcare. To suitably face them, this paper proposes an 
      easy-to-use, cheap mobile-based approach relying on three steps. First, 
      single-channel ECG data from a patient are collected by a wearable sensor and are 
      recorded on a mobile device. Second, the automatic extraction of knowledge about 
      that patient takes place offline, and a set of IF…THEN rules containing heart-rate 
      variability (HRV) parameters is achieved. Third, these rules are used in our 
      real-time mobile monitoring system: the same wearable sensor collects the 
      single-channel ECG data and sends them to the same mobile device, which now 
      processes those data online to compute HRV-related parameter values. If these values 
      activate one of the rules found for that patient, an alarm is immediately produced. 
      This approach has been tested on a literature database with 35 OSA patients. A 
      comparison against five well-known classifiers has been carried out.

PG  - 27-31
AB  - The characteristics of electrocardiogram (ECG) signal are fuzzy and random, so that 
      they are difficult for automatic analysis and diagnosis. To solve this problem, an 
      uncertainties transformation model-Cloud Model, which is a fusion of qualitative and 
      quantitative information, was tried to use to analyze the ECG signal. The model 
      fusions the characters of fuzzy and random, just suit to the ECG automatic analysis 
      and diagnosis system. Based on the theory of the cloudy transform and comprehensive 
      cloud, the clustering of ECG signal was finished. Further more, the clinic 
      experience of expert was summarized as classification rules based on the theory. The 
      experiment data were from MIT/ BIH database. The experiment results showed more 
      close to those of the expert's analysis. The describing result was more close to 
      those of the more expert's with qualitative and quantitative information. It is well 
      concluded that the method is an effective ECG signal analysis method.

TI  - Prediction of prognosis in patients with tetralogy of Fallot based on deep learning 
      imaging analysis.
LID - heartjnl-2019-315962 [pii]
LID - 10.1136/heartjnl-2019-315962 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the utility of machine learning algorithms for automatically 
      estimating prognosis in patients with repaired tetralogy of Fallot (ToF) using 
      cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR). METHODS: We included 372 patients with ToF who had 
      undergone CMR imaging as part of a nationwide prospective study. Cine loops were 
      retrieved and subjected to automatic deep learning (DL)-based image analysis, 
      trained on independent, local CMR data, to derive measures of cardiac dimensions and 
      function. This information was combined with established clinical parameters and ECG 
      markers of prognosis. RESULTS: Over a median follow-up period of 10 years, 23 
      patients experienced an endpoint of death/aborted cardiac arrest or documented 
      ventricular tachycardia (defined as >3 documented consecutive ventricular beats). On 
      univariate Cox analysis, various DL parameters, including right atrial median area 
      (HR 1.11/cm², p=0.003) and right ventricular long-axis strain (HR 0.80/%, p=0.009) 
      emerged as significant predictors of outcome. DL parameters were related to adverse 
      outcome independently of left and right ventricular ejection fraction and peak 
      oxygen uptake (p<0.05 for all). A composite score of enlarged right atrial area and 
      depressed right ventricular longitudinal function identified a ToF subgroup at 
      significantly increased risk of adverse outcome (HR 2.1/unit, p=0.007). CONCLUSIONS: 
      We present data on the utility of machine learning algorithms trained on external 
      imaging datasets to automatically estimate prognosis in patients with ToF. Due to 
      the automated analysis process these two-dimensional-based algorithms may serve as 
      surrogates for labour-intensive manually attained imaging parameters in patients 
      with ToF.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to explore the modes of initiation and clinical 
      significance of malignant rapid ventricular arrhythmias (MRVAs).The surface 12-lead 
      electrocardiogram (ECG) or sustained electrocardiomonitor graph was analyzed in 79 
      patients. All patients had at least 1 MRVA after being admitted to the 
      hospital.According to the length of coupling interval of the initial premature 
      ventricular contraction of MRVA, the modes of initiation of MRVA were divided into 
      the following types: those initiated by premature ventricular contraction with short 
      coupling intervals in patients with normal Q-T interval, and for which 
      short-long-short sequences before MRVA precipitation were not observed; those 
      initiated following short-long-short sequences, which were divided into 2 types 
      according to the length of Q-T interval: a normal Q-T interval and a long Q-T 
      interval. On the basis of the different modes of onset, treatments of MRVA were 
      different.MRVAs have different modes of onset depending on the patients' underlying 
      condition. Prompt recognition of the mode of onset is necessary to facilitate 
      appropriate management. These findings could have important pathophysiologic and 
      clinical implications.

TI  - The effect of electrocardiographic lead choice on RR time series.
PG  - 1933-6
LID - 10.1109/IEMBS.2011.6090546 [doi]
AB  - Results of heart rate variability analysis depend on the quality of the initial RR 
      time series that is measured only in one lead of the ECG. This work shows that RR 
      time series can subtly change from lead to lead so the choice of the analyzed lead 
      is another source of uncertainty. The standard deviation of the differences of two 
      RR time series obtained from different leads can change from 0.5 ms to more than 20 
      ms depending on the amount of noise, the morphological changes of the QRS complexes, 
      the strategies of fiducial point determination and the measured subject. This source 
      of uncertainty is in healthy subjects greater than that associated to the sampling 
      frequency of the ECG for sampling frequencies greater than 400 Hz.

TI  - Detection of Atrial Fibrillation Using 1D Convolutional Neural Network.
LID - 10.3390/s20072136 [doi]
LID - 2136
AB  - The automatic detection of atrial fibrillation (AF) is crucial for its association 
      with the risk of embolic stroke. Most of the existing AF detection methods usually 
      convert 1D time-series electrocardiogram (ECG) signal into 2D spectrogram to train a 
      complex AF detection system, which results in heavy training computation and high 
      implementation cost. This paper proposes an AF detection method based on an 
      end-to-end 1D convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture to raise the detection 
      accuracy and reduce network complexity. By investigating the impact of major 
      components of a convolutional block on detection accuracy and using grid search to 
      obtain optimal hyperparameters of the CNN, we develop a simple, yet effective 1D 
      CNN. Since the dataset provided by PhysioNet Challenge 2017 contains ECG recordings 
      with different lengths, we also propose a length normalization algorithm to generate 
      equal-length records to meet the requirement of CNN. Experimental results and 
      analysis indicate that our method of 1D CNN achieves an average F(1) score of 78.2%, 
      which has better detection accuracy with lower network complexity, as compared with 
      the existing deep learning-based methods.

TI  - Alteration of the P-wave non-linear dynamics near the onset of paroxysmal atrial 
      fibrillation.

AB  - The analysis of P-wave variability from the electrocardiogram (ECG) has been 
      suggested as an early predictor of the onset of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation 
      (PAF). Hence, a preventive treatment could be used to avoid the loss of normal sinus 
      rhythm, thus minimising health risks and improving the patient's quality of life. In 
      these previous studies the variability of different temporal and morphological 
      P-wave features has been only analysed in a linear fashion. However, the 
      electrophysiological alteration occurring in the atria before the onset of PAF has 
      to be considered as an inherently complex, chaotic and non-stationary process. This 
      work analyses the presence of non-linear dynamics in the P-wave progression before 
      the onset of PAF through the application of the central tendency measure (CTM), 
      which is a non-linear metric summarising the degree of variability in a time series. 
      Two hour-length ECG intervals just before the arrhythmia onset belonging to 46 
      different PAF patients were analysed. In agreement with the invasively observed 
      inhomogeneous atrial conduction preceding the onset of PAF, CTM for all the 
      considered P-wave features showed higher variability when the arrhythmia was closer 
      to its onset. A diagnostic accuracy around 80% to discern between ECG segments far 
      from PAF and close to PAF was obtained with the CTM of the metrics considered. This 
      result was similar to previous P-wave variability methods based on linear 
      approaches. However, the combination of linear and non-linear methods with a 
      decision tree improved considerably their discriminant ability up to 90%, thus 
      suggesting that both dynamics could coexist at the same time in the fragmented 
      depolarisation of the atria preceding the arrhythmia.

AB  - Nonlinear measures can capture the complex structure of the heart beating, and 
      recordings taken while the individual performs daily activities may help to 
      understand the cardiac system's output in natural conditions. As healthy systems are 
      characterized by having highly complex outputs, we hypothesized that the cardiac 
      output from high anxious adolescents should be less complex than the output from 
      their low anxious counterparts. In this study ECG was recorded for two hours in 50 
      adolescents while they performed regular school activities. Fractal dimension (FD), 
      scaling exponents and multiscale entropy were calculated on the interbeat intervals 
      time series. Both FD and entropy were significantly lower in the high-anxious group 
      than the low-anxious group. These results suggest different heart-related regulation 
      in adolescents who suffered from high anxious symptomatology.

LID - 10.1148/radiol.13131331 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To demonstrate the feasibility of comprehensive assessment of cardiac 
      arrhythmias by combining body surface electrocardiographic (ECG) mapping (BSM) and 
      imaging. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was approved by the institutional review 
      board, and all patients gave written informed consent. Twenty-seven patients 
      referred for electrophysiologic procedures in the context of ventricular tachycardia 
      (VT) (n = 9), Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome (n = 2), atrial fibrillation (AF) 
      (n = 13), or scar-related ventricular fibrillation (VF) (n = 3) were examined. 
      Patients underwent BSM and imaging with multidetector computed tomography (CT) (n = 
      12) and/or delayed enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging (n = 23). BSM was 
      performed by using a 252-electrode vest that enabled the computation of epicardial 
      electrograms from body surface potentials. The epicardial geometry used for BSM was 
      registered to the epicardial geometry segmented from imaging data by using an 
      automatic algorithm. The output was a three-dimensional cardiac model that 
      integrated cardiac anatomy, myocardial substrate, and epicardial activation. 
      RESULTS: Acquisition, segmentation, and registration were feasible in all patients. 
      In VT, this enabled a noninvasive assessment of the arrhythmia mechanism and its 
      location with respect to the myocardial substrate, coronary vessels, and phrenic 
      nerve. In WPW syndrome, this enabled understanding of complex accessory pathways 
      resistant to previous ablation. In AF and VF, this enabled the noninvasive 
      assessment of arrhythmia mechanisms and the analysis of rotor trajectories with 
      respect to the myocardial substrate. In all patients, models were successfully 
      integrated in navigation systems and used to guide mapping and ablation. CONCLUSION: 
      By combining information on anatomy, substrate, and electrical activation, the 
      fusion of BSM and imaging enables comprehensive noninvasive assessment of cardiac 
      arrhythmias, with potential applications for diagnosis, prognosis, and ablation 
      targeting. Online supplemental material is available for this article.

      measurement in the community.
PG  - e010745

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Timely detection of atrial fibrillation (AF) may effectively prevent 
      cardiovascular consequences. However, traditional diagnostic tools are either poorly 
      reliable (pulse palpation) or not readily accessible (ECG) in general practice. We 
      tested whether an automatic oscillometric blood pressure (BP) monitor embedded with 
      an algorithm for AF detection might be effective for opportunistic screening of 
      asymptomatic AF in the community. SETTING: A community-based screening campaign in 
      an unselected population to verify the feasibility of AF screening with a Microlife 
      WatchBP Office BP monitor with a patented AFIB algorithm. When possible AF was 
      detected (≥2 of 3 BP measurements reporting AF), a doctor immediately performed a 
      single-lead ECG in order to confirm or exclude the presence of the arrhythmia. The 
      main demographic and clinical data were also collected. PARTICIPANTS: 220 
      consecutive participants from an unselected sample of individuals in a small Italian 
      community. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Number of patients detected with 
      AF and diagnosed risk factors for AF. RESULTS: In 12 of 220 participants, the device 
      detected possible AF during the BP measurement: in 4 of them (1.8%), the arrhythmia 
      was confirmed by the ECG. Patients with AF were more likely to be older (77.0±1.2 vs 
      57.2±15.2 years, p=0.010), obese (50.0 vs 14.4%, p=0.048) and to suffer from a 
      cardiovascular disease (50.0 vs 10.6%, p=0.014) than patients without AF. 
      Participants with a positive BP AF reading and non-AF arrhythmias (n=8) did not 
      differ in their general characteristics from participants with a negative BP AF 
      reading and were younger than patients with AF (mean age 56.4±14.8, p=0.027; 5 of 8 
      participants aged <65 years). CONCLUSIONS: Opportunistic screening of AF by BP 
      measurement is feasible to diagnose this arrhythmia in unaware participants, 
      particularly in those older than 65 years, who are the target patient group 
      recommended by current AF screening guidelines.

TI  - Sleep apnea classification using least-squares support vector machines on single 
      lead ECG.

AB  - In this paper a methodology to identify sleep apnea events is presented. It uses 
      four easily computable features, three generally known ones and a newly proposed 
      feature. Of the three well known parameters, two are computed from the RR interval 
      time series and the other one from the approximate respiratory signal derived from 
      the ECG using principal component analysis (PCA). The fourth feature is proposed in 
      this paper and it is computed from the principal components of the QRS complexes. 
      Together with a least squares support vector machines (LS-SVM) classifier using an 
      RBF kernel, these four features achieve an accuracy on test data larger than 85% for 
      a subject independent classification, and of more than 90% for a patient specific 
      approach. These values are comparable with other results in the literature, but have 
      the advantage that their computation is straightforward and much simpler. This can 
      be important when implemented in a home monitoring system, which typically has 
      limited computational resources.

TI  - Recording duration and short-term reproducibility of heart rate and QT interval 
      variability in patients with myocardial infarction.
PG  - 1925-1933
AB  - Beat-to-beat variability of the QT interval (QTV) measured on surface ECG has 
      emerged as a potential marker for ventricular repolarization instability and has 
      been used along with heart rate variability (HRV) to predict arrhythmic risk. Since 
      measurement modalities of QTV have not been standardized, the objective of this 
      study was to investigate the effect of ECG recording duration on QTV as well as HRV. 
      Using a database of 30 min ECG recorded from 500 patients with acute myocardial 
      infraction during rest, we extracted RR and QT interval time series and estimated 
      different HRV and QTV metrics over windows of varying length. Analysis of variance 
      (ANOVA) and intra-class correlation analyses were computed to investigate the effect 
      of recording length on consistency and short-term reproducibility of HRV and QTV 
      variables. Good consistency (non-significant ANOVA results) and short-term 
      reproducibility (intra-class correlation coefficients  >0.8) were demonstrated for 
      all but standard deviation based metrics when at least 200 beats were included in 
      the estimation. In conclusion, QTV can be quantified from resting ECG with good 
      short-term consistency and reproducibility that is comparable to that of HRV.

TI  - Estimation of respiratory rate using infrared video in an inpatient population: an 
      observational study.
LID - 10.1007/s10877-019-00437-2 [doi]
AB  - Respiratory rate (RR) is one of the most sensitive markers of a deteriorating 
      patient. Despite this, there is significant inter-observer discrepancy when measured 
      by clinical staff, and modalities used in clinical practice such as ECG bioimpedance 
      are prone to error. This study utilized infrared thermography (IRT) to measure RR in 
      a critically ill population in the Intensive Care Unit. This study was carried out 
      in a Single Hospital Centre. Respiratory rate in 27 extubated ICU patients was 
      counted by two observers and compared to ECG Bioimpedance and IRT-derived RR at 
      distances of 0.4-0.6 m and > 1 m respectively. IRT-derived RR using two separate 
      computer vision algorithms outperformed ECG derived RR at distances of 0.4-0.6 m. 
      Using an Autocorrelation estimator, mean bias was - 0.667 breaths/min. Using a Fast 
      Fourier Transform estimator, mean bias was - 1.000 breaths/min. At distances greater 
      than 1 m no statistically significant signal could be obtained. Over all 
      frequencies, there was a significant relationship between the RR estimated using IRT 
      and via manual counting, with Pearson correlation coefficients between 0.796 and 
      0.943 (p < 0.001). Correlation between counting and ECG-derived RR demonstrated 
      significance only at > 19 bpm (r = 0.562, p = 0.029). Overall agreement between 
      IRT-derived RR at distances of 0.4-0.6 m and gold standard counting was 
      satisfactory, and outperformed ECG derived bioimpedance. Contactless IRT derived RR 
      may be feasible as a routine monitoring modality in wards and subacute inpatient 
      settings.

TI  - Automatic Detection of Arrhythmia Based on Multi-Resolution Representation of ECG 
      Signal.
LID - 10.3390/s20061579 [doi]
LID - 1579
AB  - Automatic detection of arrhythmia is of great significance for early prevention and 
      diagnosis of cardiovascular disease. Traditional feature engineering methods based 
      on expert knowledge lack multidimensional and multi-view information abstraction and 
      data representation ability, so the traditional research on pattern recognition of 
      arrhythmia detection cannot achieve satisfactory results. Recently, with the 
      increase of deep learning technology, automatic feature extraction of ECG data based 
      on deep neural networks has been widely discussed. In order to utilize the 
      complementary strength between different schemes, in this paper, we propose an 
      arrhythmia detection method based on the multi-resolution representation (MRR) of 
      ECG signals. This method utilizes four different up to date deep neural networks as 
      four channel models for ECG vector representations learning. The deep learning based 
      representations, together with hand-crafted features of ECG, forms the MRR, which is 
      the input of the downstream classification strategy. The experimental results of big 
      ECG dataset multi-label classification confirm that the F1 score of the proposed 
      method is 0.9238, which is 1.31%, 0.62%, 1.18% and 0.6% higher than that of each 
      channel model. From the perspective of architecture, this proposed method is highly 
      scalable and can be employed as an example for arrhythmia recognition.

TI  - Extended Kalman smoother with differential evolution technique for denoising of ECG 
      signal.
PG  - 783-95
LID - 10.1007/s13246-016-0468-4 [doi]
AB  - Electrocardiogram (ECG) signal gives a lot of information on the physiology of 
      heart. In reality, noise from various sources interfere with the ECG signal. To get 
      the correct information on physiology of the heart, noise cancellation of the ECG 
      signal is required. In this paper, the effectiveness of extended Kalman smoother 
      (EKS) with the differential evolution (DE) technique for noise cancellation of the 
      ECG signal is investigated. DE is used as an automatic parameter selection method 
      for the selection of ten optimized components of the ECG signal, and those are used 
      to create the ECG signal according to the real ECG signal. These parameters are used 
      by the EKS for the development of the state equation and also for initialization of 
      the parameters of EKS. EKS framework is used for denoising the ECG signal from the 
      single channel. The effectiveness of proposed noise cancellation technique has been 
      evaluated by adding white, colored Gaussian noise and real muscle artifact noise at 
      different SNR to some visually clean ECG signals from the MIT-BIH arrhythmia 
      database. The proposed noise cancellation technique of ECG signal shows better 
      signal to noise ratio (SNR) improvement, lesser mean square error (MSE) and percent 
      of distortion (PRD) compared to other well-known methods.

TI  - Heart rate variability in newborns with hypoxic brain injury.
PG  - 43-48
LID - 10.1007/978-1-4614-7411-1_7 [doi]
AB  - In neonatal intensive care units, there is a need for continuous monitoring of sick 
      newborns with perinatal hypoxic ischemic brain injury (HIE). We assessed the utility 
      of heart rate variability (HRV) in newborns with acute HIE undergoing simultaneous 
      continuous EEG (cEEG) and ECG monitoring. HIE was classified using clinical criteria 
      as well as visual grading of cEEG. Newborns were divided into two groups depending 
      on the severity of the hypoxic injury and outcome. Various HRV parameters were 
      compared between these groups, and significantly decreased HRV was found in neonates 
      with severe HIE. As HRV is affected by many factors, it is difficult to attribute 
      this difference solely to HIE. However, this study suggests that further 
      investigation of HRV as a monitoring tool for acute neonatal hypoxic injury is 
      warranted.

TI  - Electrocardiogram-assisted blood pressure estimation.
PG  - 608-18
LID - 10.1109/TBME.2011.2180019 [doi]
AB  - Accurate automatic noninvasive assessment of blood pressure (BP) presents a 
      challenge due to conditions like arrhythmias, obesity, and postural changes that 
      tend to obfuscate arterial amplitude pulsations sensed by the cuff. Researchers 
      tried to overcome this challenge by analyzing oscillometric pulses with the aid of a 
      higher fidelity signal-the electrocardiogram (ECG). Moreover, pulse transit time 
      (PTT) was employed to provide an additional method for BP estimation. However, these 
      methods were not fully developed, suitably integrated, or tested. To address these 
      issues, we present a novel method whereby ECG-assisted oscillometric and PTT 
      (measured between ECG R-peaks and maximum slope of arterial pulse peaks) analyses 
      are seamlessly integrated into the oscillometric BP measurement paradigm. The method 
      bolsters oscillometric analysis (amplitude modulation) with more reliable ECG 
      R-peaks provides a complementary measure with PTT analysis (temporal modulation) and 
      fuses this information for robust BP estimation. We have integrated this technology 
      into a prototype that comprises a BP cuff with an embedded conductive fabric ECG 
      electrode, associated hardware, and algorithms. A pilot study has been undertaken on 
      ten healthy subjects (150 recordings) to validate the performance of our prototype 
      against United States Food and Drug Administration approved Omron oscillometric 
      monitor (HEM-790IT). Our prototype achieves mean absolute difference of less than 5 
      mmHg and grade A as per the British Hypertension Society protocol for estimating BP, 
      with the reference Omron monitor.

TI  - Nonlinear time series analysis of electrocardiograms.
PG  - 95-101
AB  - In recent years there has been an increasing number of papers in the literature, 
      applying the methods and techniques of Nonlinear Dynamics to the time series of 
      electrical activity in normal electrocardiograms (ECGs) of various human subjects. 
      Most of these studies are based primarily on correlation dimension estimates, and 
      conclude that the dynamics of the ECG signal is deterministic and occurs on a 
      chaotic attractor, whose dimension can distinguish between healthy and severely 
      malfunctioning cases. In this paper, we first demonstrate that correlation dimension 
      calculations must be used with care, as they do not always yield reliable estimates 
      of the attractor's "dimension." We then carry out a number of additional tests (time 
      differencing, smoothing, principal component analysis, surrogate data analysis, 
      etc.) on the ECGs of three "normal" subjects and three "heavy smokers" at rest and 
      after mild exercising, whose cardiac rhythms look very similar. Our main conclusion 
      is that no major dynamical differences are evident in these signals. A preliminary 
      estimate of three to four basic variables governing the dynamics (based on 
      correlation dimension calculations) is updated to five to six, when temporal 
      correlations between points are removed. Finally, in almost all cases, the 
      transition between resting and mild exercising seems to imply a small increase in 
      the complexity of cardiac dynamics. (c) 1995 American Institute of Physics.

TI  - [Magnetocardiography for assessment of fetal heart actions].
PG  - 642-6
AB  - Magnetocardiography provides a new, alternative method for fetal surveillance. This 
      method allows the registration of changes in the magnetic field produced by the 
      fetal cardiac system. In comparison to fetal ECG, the fetal magnetocardiogram (fMCG) 
      is not affected by intermediate tissue, in particular by the insulating effect of 
      the vernix caseosa. Furthermore fMCG's with a good signal noise ratio can be 
      obtained in the second trimester. A multichannel biomagnetometer allows the 
      non-invasive measurement of the magnetic signals produced by the fetus. Examples of 
      dta and evaluation techniques are given. Signal processing software allows the 
      identification of all fetal beats in a data set, permitting the calculation of an 
      averaged beat and the evaluation of signal morphology and cardiac time intervals. 
      Furthermore it is possible to produce a beat to beat time series with high temporal 
      resolution, making the evaluation of heart rate variability with measures from the 
      time, frequency, and phase domain accessible. Particularly the latter are of 
      interest in investigating changes in temporal complexity of the fetal cardiac 
      system. Magnetocardiography thus holds the promise of improved antenatal 
      surveillance as of the second trimester.

PG  - 983479

LID - 983479
AB  - We propose the method to compute the nonlinear parameters of heart rhythm 
      (correlation dimension D₂ and correlation entropy K₂) using 5-minute ECG recordings 
      preferred for screening of population. Conversion of RR intervals' time series into 
      continuous function x(t) allows getting the new time series with different sampling 
      rate dt. It has been shown that for all dt (250, 200, 125, and 100 ms) the 
      cross-plots of D₂ and K₂ against embedding dimension m for phase-space 
      reconstruction start to level off at m = 9. The sample size N at different sampling 
      rates varied from 1200 at dt = 250 ms to 3000 at dt = 100 ms. Along with, the D₂ and 
      K₂ means were not statistically different; that is, the sampling rate did not 
      influence the results. We tested the feasibility of the method in two models: 
      nonlinear heart rhythm dynamics in different states of autonomous nervous system and 
      age-related characteristics of nonlinear parameters. According to the acquired data, 
      the heart rhythm is more complex in childhood and adolescence with more influential 
      parasympathetic influence against the background of elevated activity of sympathetic 
      autonomous nervous system.

AB  - A hidden Markov model (HMM) of electrocardiogram (ECG) signal is presented for 
      detection of myocardial ischemia. The time domain signals that are recorded by the 
      ECG before and during the episode of local ischemia were pre-processed to produce 
      input sequences, which is needed for the model training. The model is also verified 
      by test data, and the results show that the models have certain function for the 
      detection of myocardial ischemia. The algorithm based on HMM provides a possible 
      approach for the timely, rapid and automatic diagnosis of myocardial ischemia, and 
      also can be used in portable medical diagnostic equipment in the future.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Based on the theory of probability and not equiprobable entropy ratios 
      in the context of dynamical systems theory, a methodology for cardiac dynamic 
      evaluation was developed. OBJECTIVES: To confirm the clinical applicability of the 
      diagnostic methodology based on probability and entropy for patients with different 
      types of arrhythmia assessing the degree of intensification in the ICU through its 
      characteristic proportions. METHODS: 80 Holter records from ICU diagnosed with 
      arrhythmia and 20 normal were analyzed. Holter clinical findings were masked and 
      were taken from them the maximum and minimum values of heart rate and total number 
      of beats per minute to build the numerical attractor for each dynamics. Probability, 
      entropy, S/k ratio, and proportions of entropy were evaluated, establishing its 
      mathematical diagnosis and quantifying its severity level. RESULTS: It was shown 
      that the methodology difference in all cases normal of abnormal dynamics, obtaining 
      a sensitivity and specificity of 100 % and Kappa coefficient of 1, showing that it 
      is also possible to establish quantitatively the degree of exacerbation. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The methodology developed is useful in clinical practice to correlate 
      the severity of arrhythmias with physical and mathematical predictions of 
      exacerbation.

AB  - A new non-invasive continuous cardiac output (esCCO) monitoring system solely 
      utilizing a routine cardiovascular monitor was developed, even though a reference 
      cardiac output (CO) is consistently required. Subsequently, a non-invasive patient 
      information CO calibration together with a new automated exclusion algorithm was 
      implemented in the esCCO system. We evaluated the accuracy and trending ability of 
      the new esCCO system. Either operative or postoperative data of a multicenter study 
      in Japan for evaluation of the accuracy of the original version of esCCO system were 
      used to develop the new esCCO system. A total of 207 patients, mostly cardiac 
      surgical patients, were enrolled in the study. Data were manually reviewed to 
      formulate a new automated exclusion algorithm with enhanced accuracy. Then, a new 
      esCCO system based on a patient information calibration together with the automated 
      exclusion algorithm was developed. CO measured with a new esCCO system was compared 
      with the corresponding intermittent bolus thermodilution CO (ICO) utilizing 
      statistical methods including polar plots analysis. A total of 465 sets of CO data 
      obtained using the new esCCO system were evaluated. The difference in the CO value 
      between the new esCCO and ICO was 0.34 ± 1.50 (SD) L/min (95 % confidence limits of 
      -2.60 to 3.28 L/min). The percentage error was 69.6 %. Polar plots analysis showed 
      that the mean polar angle was -1.6° and radial limits of agreement were ±53.3°. This 
      study demonstrates that the patient information calibration is clinically useful as 
      ICO, but trending ability of the new esCCO system is not clinically acceptable as 
      judged by percentage error and polar plots analysis, even though it's trending 
      ability is comparable with currently available arterial waveform analysis methods.

AB  - A wearable armband electrocardiogram (ECG) monitor has been used for daily life 
      monitoring. The armband records three ECG channels, one electromyogram (EMG) 
      channel, and tri-axial accelerometer signals. Contrary to conventional Holter 
      monitors, the armband-based ECG device is convenient for long-term daily life 
      monitoring because it uses no obstructive leads and has dry electrodes (no 
      hydrogels), which do not cause skin irritation even after a few days. Principal 
      component analysis (PCA) and normalized least mean squares (NLMS) adaptive filtering 
      were used to reduce the EMG noise from the ECG channels. An artifact detector and an 
      optimal channel selector were developed based on a support vector machine (SVM) 
      classifier with a radial basis function (RBF) kernel using features that are related 
      to the ECG signal quality. Mean HR was estimated from the 24-hour armband recordings 
      from 16 volunteers in segments of 10 seconds each. In addition, four classical HR 
      variability (HRV) parameters (SDNN, RMSSD, and powers at low and high frequency 
      bands) were computed. For comparison purposes, the same parameters were estimated 
      also for data from a commercial Holter monitor. The armband provided usable data 
      (difference less than 10% from Holter-estimated mean HR) during 75.25%/11.02% 
      (inter-subject median/interquartile range) of segments when the user was not in bed, 
      and during 98.49%/0.79% of the bed segments. The automatic artifact detector found 
      53.85%/17.09% of the data to be usable during the non-bed time, and 95.00%/2.35% to 
      be usable during the time in bed. The HRV analysis obtained a relative error with 
      respect to the Holter data not higher than 1.37% (inter-subject median/interquartile 
      range). Although further studies have to be conducted for specific applications, 
      results suggest that the armband device has a good potential for daily life HR 
      monitoring, especially for applications such as arrhythmia or seizure detection, 
      stress assessment, or sleep studies.

AB  - The amount of coronary artery calcification (CAC) quantified in computed tomography 
      (CT) scans enables prediction of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. However, 
      interscan variability of CAC quantification is high, especially in scans made 
      without ECG synchronization. We propose a method for automatic detection of CACs 
      that are severely affected by cardiac motion. Subsequently, we evaluate the impact 
      of such CACs on CAC quantification and CVD risk determination. This study includes 
      1000 baseline and 585 one-year follow-up low-dose chest CTs from the National Lung 
      Screening Trial. About 415 baseline scans are used to train and evaluate a 
      convolutional neural network that identifies observer determined CACs affected by 
      severe motion artifacts. Therefore, 585 paired scans acquired at baseline and 
      follow-up were used to evaluate the impact of severe motion artifacts on CAC 
      quantification and risk categorization. Based on the CAC amount, the scans were 
      categorized into four standard CVD risk categories. The method identified CACs 
      affected by severe motion artifacts with 85.2% accuracy. Moreover, reproducibility 
      of CAC scores in scan pairs is higher in scans containing mostly CACs not affected 
      by severe cardiac motion. Hence, the proposed method enables identification of scans 
      affected by severe cardiac motion, where CAC quantification may not be reproducible.

AB  - Previous studies have proposed varying causes for idiopathic sudden sensorineural 
      hearing loss (SSNHL), including vascular occlusion, ruptured inner ear membrane, 
      acoustic tumours and circulatory disturbances in the inner ear. The objective of 
      this study was to characterise the autonomic regulation in 19 SSNHL patients in 
      comparison to 19 healthy age-gender matched normal-hearing control subjects (CON) in 
      order to improve the diagnostics of vascular caused hearing loss in SSNHL patients. 
      A high-resolution short-term electrocardiogram (ECG) and the continuous noninvasive 
      blood pressure signal were simultaneously recorded under resting conditions (30min). 
      Linear and nonlinear indices of heart rate- and blood pressure variability (HRV, 
      BPV) were calculated to characterise autonomic regulation. The results showed that 
      HRV analysis did not produce significantly different results between SSNHL and CON, 
      whereas linear and nonlinear BPV indices showed significant differences between both 
      groups (p<0.01). This study was the first to show an altered cardiovascular 
      regulation in SSNHL patients when compared to CON subjects, based on continuous 
      blood pressure analysis. This was characterised by reduced variability, complexity 
      and dynamics of blood pressure time series in SSNHL. These findings may contribute 
      to an improved classification of the controversially discussed causes of SSNHL and, 
      in addition, may lead to improved diagnostic strategies for a subgroup of SSNHL 
      patients whose hearing loss is caused by cardiovascular factors.

PG  - 084006
LID - 10.1088/1361-6579/aad7e4 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This work aims at providing a new method for the automatic detection of 
      atrial fibrillation, other arrhythmia and noise on short single-lead ECG signals, 
      emphasizing the importance of the interpretability of the classification results. 
      APPROACH: A morphological and rhythm description of the cardiac behavior is obtained 
      by a knowledge-based interpretation of the signal using the Construe abductive 
      framework. Then, a set of meaningful features are extracted for each individual 
      heartbeat and as a summary of the full record. The feature distributions can be used 
      to elucidate the expert criteria underlying the labeling of the 2017 PhysioNet/CinC 
      Challenge dataset, enabling a manual partial relabeling to improve the consistency 
      of the training set. Finally, a tree gradient boosting model and a recurrent neural 
      network are combined using the stacking technique to provide an answer on the basis 
      of the feature values. MAIN RESULTS: The proposal was independently validated 
      against the hidden dataset of the Challenge, achieving a combined F (1) score of 
      0.83 and tying for the first place in the official stage of the Challenge. This 
      result was even improved in the follow-up stage to 0.85 with a significant 
      simplification of the model, attaining the highest score so far reported on the 
      hidden dataset. SIGNIFICANCE: The obtained results demonstrate the potential of 
      Construe to provide robust and valuable descriptions of temporal data, even with the 
      presence of significant amounts of noise. Furthermore, the importance of consistent 
      classification criteria in manually labeled training datasets is emphasized, and the 
      fundamental advantages of knowledge-based approaches to formalize and validate those 
      criteria are discussed.

TI  - Nonlinear Indices with Applications to Schizophrenia and Bipolar Disorder.
PG  - 17-56
AB  - In this article we study the application of nonlinear indices (sometimes called 
      complexity indices) to univariate time series data arising from studies of 
      schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Specifically, we consider time series arising 
      from EEG studies, ECG studies, and self-report mood data. As part of our analysis, 
      we empirically examine the claim in the literature that complexity tends to be 
      higher in the EEG of schizophrenia patients than controls and that this tendency is 
      dampened or even inverted by medication, increasing age, and reduced symptomatology. 
      Our conclusion is that this claim is only partially supported and propose that 
      symptomatology, specifically the presence or absence of schizophrenia 'deficit 
      syndrome,' may be the most important factor. Results are more consistent in ECG 
      studies in which reduced heart rate complexity is observed in both schizophrenia and 
      bipolar disorder. The applications of nonlinear indices to the effects of 
      antipsychotic medication and the discrimination of mood states are also examined. It 
      is concluded that the monitoring of nonlinear indices may be useful in predicting 
      response to medication and predicting onset of specific mood states.

TI  - ECG-based Random Forest Classifier for Cardiac Arrest Rhythms.
PG  - 1504-1508
LID - 10.1109/EMBC.2019.8857893 [doi]
AB  - Rhythm annotation of out-of-hospital cardiac episodes (OHCA) is key for a better 
      understanding of the interplay between resuscitation therapy and OHCA patient 
      outcome. OHCA rhythms are classified in five categories, asystole (AS), pulseless 
      electrical activity (PEA), pulsed rhythms (PR), ventricular fibrillation (VF) and 
      ventricular tachycardia (VT). Manual OHCA annotation by expert clinicians is onerous 
      and time consuming, so there is a need for accurate and automatic OHCA rhythm 
      annotation methods. For this study 852 OHCA episodes of patients treated with 
      Automated External Defibrillators (AED) by the Emergency Medical Services of the 
      Basque Country were analyzed. Six expert clinicians reviewed the electrocardiogram 
      (ECG) of 4214 AED rhythm analyses and annotated the rhythm. Their consensus decision 
      was used as ground truth. There were a total of 2418 AS, 294 PR, 1008 PEA, 472 VF 
      and 22 VT. The ECG analysis intervals were extracted and used to develop an 
      automatic rhythm annotator. Data was partitioned patient-wise into training (70%) 
      and test (30%). Performance was evaluated in terms of per class sensitivity (Se) and 
      F-score (F1). The unweighted mean of sensitivity (UMS) and F-score were used as 
      global performance metrics. The classification method is composed of a feature 
      extraction and denoising stage based on the stationary wavelet transform of the ECG, 
      and on a random forest classifier. The best model presented a per rhythm Se/F1 of 
      95.8/95.7, 43.3/52.2, 85.3/81.3, 94.2/96.1, 81.9/72.2 for AS, PR, PEA, VF and VT, 
      respectively. The UMS for the test set was 80.2%, 2-points above that of previous 
      solutions. This method could be used to retrospectively annotate large OHCA datasets 
      and ameliorate the workload of manual OHCA rhythm annotation.

AB  - Electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring allows temporal analysis of cardiac rhythm. We 
      are usually interested in the variability of two components of the ECG: RR interval 
      (a surrogate marker of cardiac interval) and QT interval (the duration of 
      ventricular depolarization/repolarization). Quantification of RR rhythm, called 
      heart rate variability (HRV) analysis, reflects the cardiac influences of the 
      autonomic nervous system. QT variability provides insight regarding the risk of 
      ventricular arrhythmia, and is at least partially independent of HRV. In this 
      review, we consider the analysis of ECG time series during physical exercise. Our 
      objectives were to show the variety of methods that can be used to characterize 
      these time series data and to demonstrate "normal" changes in these characteristics 
      during exercise and recovery. Attaining a comprehensive understanding of cardiac 
      electrical conduction changes during exercise is not straightforward: analysis 
      methods are numerous and results require careful interpretation. However, we 
      recommend that assessment of both HRV and QT properties yields the most valuable 
      information, the utility of which can be appreciated from the viewpoints of the 
      athlete (e.g. providing feedback on the cardiac effects of training), the clinician 
      (assisting in cardiovascular screening and exercise therapy evaluation) and the 
      exercise physiologist (providing data for physiological process modelling).

TI  - Early classification of pathological heartbeats on wireless body sensor nodes.
PG  - 22532-51
LID - 10.3390/s141222532 [doi]
AB  - Smart Wireless Body Sensor Nodes (WBSNs) are a novel class of unobtrusive, 
      battery-powered devices allowing the continuous monitoring and real-time 
      interpretation of a subject's bio-signals, such as the electrocardiogram (ECG). 
      These low-power platforms, while able to perform advanced signal processing to 
      extract information on heart conditions, are usually constrained in terms of 
      computational power and transmission bandwidth. It is therefore essential to 
      identify in the early stages which parts of an ECG are critical for the diagnosis 
      and, only in these cases, activate on demand more detailed and computationally 
      intensive analysis algorithms. In this work, we present a comprehensive framework 
      for real-time automatic classification of normal and abnormal heartbeats, targeting 
      embedded and resource-constrained WBSNs. In particular, we provide a comparative 
      analysis of different strategies to reduce the heartbeat representation 
      dimensionality, and therefore the required computational effort. We then combine 
      these techniques with a neuro-fuzzy classification strategy, which effectively 
      discerns normal and pathological heartbeats with a minimal run time and memory 
      overhead. We prove that, by performing a detailed analysis only on the heartbeats 
      that our classifier identifies as abnormal, a WBSN system can drastically reduce its 
      overall energy consumption. Finally, we assess the choice of neuro-fuzzy 
      classification by comparing its performance and workload with respect to other 
      state-of-the-art strategies. Experimental results using the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia 
      database show energy savings of as much as 60% in the signal processing stage, and 
      63% in the subsequent wireless transmission, when a neuro-fuzzy classification 
      structure is employed, coupled with a dimensionality reduction technique based on 
      random projections.

TI  - Analysis of surface atrial signals: time series with missing data?
PG  - 2082-92
LID - 10.1007/s10439-009-9757-3 [doi]
AB  - Uncovering of the atrial signal for patients undergoing episodes of atrial 
      fibrillation is usually obtained from surface ECG by removing waves induced by 
      ventricular activities. Once earned the atrial signal, the detection of the dominant 
      fibrillation frequency is often the main (and only) goal. In this work we verified 
      if subtraction of the ventricular activity might be avoided by performing spectral 
      analysis on those ECG segments where ventricular activity is absent, (i.e. the T-Q 
      intervals). While the approach might seem crude, in here the question was recast 
      into a problem of missing data in a long time series and proper methods were 
      applied: the Lomb periodogram and the iterative Singular Spectrum Analysis. The two 
      methods were tested on both simulated signals and "realistic" atrial signals 
      constructed using the ECG recordings provided by the 2004 Computers in Cardiology 
      competition. The results obtained showed that both techniques were able to provide a 
      reliable quantification of the dominant oscillation, with a slightly superior 
      performance of the iterative Singular Spectrum Analysis. Absolute errors larger than 
      1.0 Hz were unlikely (p < 0.05) up to 130-140 bpm. Such level of agreement is 
      consistent with similar comparative works where techniques for separating the atrial 
      signal from ventricular waves were considered.

TI  - CSE database: extended annotations and new recommendations for ECG software testing.
PG  - 1473-1482
LID - 10.1007/s11517-016-1607-5 [doi]
AB  - Nowadays, cardiovascular diseases represent the most common cause of death in 
      western countries. Among various examination techniques, electrocardiography (ECG) 
      is still a highly valuable tool used for the diagnosis of many cardiovascular 
      disorders. In order to diagnose a person based on ECG, cardiologists can use 
      automatic diagnostic algorithms. Research in this area is still necessary. In order 
      to compare various algorithms correctly, it is necessary to test them on standard 
      annotated databases, such as the Common Standards for Quantitative 
      Electrocardiography (CSE) database. According to Scopus, the CSE database is the 
      second most cited standard database. There were two main objectives in this work. 
      First, new diagnoses were added to the CSE database, which extended its original 
      annotations. Second, new recommendations for diagnostic software quality estimation 
      were established. The ECG recordings were diagnosed by five new cardiologists 
      independently, and in total, 59 different diagnoses were found. Such a large number 
      of diagnoses is unique, even in terms of standard databases. Based on the 
      cardiologists' diagnoses, a four-round consensus (4R consensus) was established. 
      Such a 4R consensus means a correct final diagnosis, which should ideally be the 
      output of any tested classification software. The accuracy of the cardiologists' 
      diagnoses compared with the 4R consensus was the basis for the establishment of 
      accuracy recommendations. The accuracy was determined in terms of 
      sensitivity = 79.20-86.81%, positive predictive value = 79.10-87.11%, and the 
      Jaccard coefficient = 72.21-81.14%, respectively. Within these ranges, the accuracy 
      of the software is comparable with the accuracy of cardiologists. The accuracy 
      quantification of the correct classification is unique. Diagnostic software 
      developers can objectively evaluate the success of their algorithm and promote its 
      further development. The annotations and recommendations proposed in this work will 
      allow for faster development and testing of classification software. As a result, 
      this might facilitate cardiologists' work and lead to faster diagnoses and earlier 
      treatment.

LID - 2185378
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The extensive use of electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings 
      during experimental protocols using small rodents requires an automatic delineation 
      technique in the ECG with high performance. It has been shown that the wavelet 
      transform (WT) based ECG delineator is a suitable tool to delineate 
      electrocardiographic waveforms. The aim of this work is to implement and evaluate 
      the ECG waves delineation in Wistar rats applying WT. We also describe the ECG 
      signal of the Wistar rats giving the characteristics of its spectrum among other 
      useful information. METHODS: We evaluated a delineator based on WT in a Wistar rat 
      electrocardiograms database which was annotated manually by experienced observers. 
      RESULTS: The delineation showed an "overall performance" such as sensitivity and a 
      positive predictive value of 99.2% and 83.9% for P-wave, 100% and 99.9% for QRS 
      complex, and 100% and 99.8% for T-wave, respectively. We also compared temporal 
      analysis based ECG delineator with the WT based ECG delineator in RR interval, QRS 
      duration, QT interval, and T-wave peak-to-end duration. The results showed that WT 
      outperforms the temporal delineation technique in all parameters analyzed. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Finally, we propose a WT based ECG delineator as a methodology to 
      implement in a wide diversity of experimental ECG analyses using Wistar rats.

TI  - Automatic detection of atrial fibrillation in cardiac vibration signals.
PG  - 162-71
LID - 10.1109/TITB.2012.2225067 [doi]
AB  - We present a study on the feasibility of the automatic detection of atrial 
      fibrillation (AF) from cardiac vibration signals (ballistocardiograms/BCGs) recorded 
      by unobtrusive bedmounted sensors. The proposed system is intended as a screening 
      and monitoring tool in home-healthcare applications and not as a replacement for 
      ECG-based methods used in clinical environments. Based on BCG data recorded in a 
      study with 10 AF patients, we evaluate and rank seven popular machine learning 
      algorithms (naive Bayes, linear and quadratic discriminant analysis, support vector 
      machines, random forests as well as bagged and boosted trees) for their performance 
      in separating 30 s long BCG epochs into one of three classes: sinus rhythm, atrial 
      fibrillation, and artifact. For each algorithm, feature subsets of a set of 
      statistical time-frequency-domain and time-domain features were selected based on 
      the mutual information between features and class labels as well as first- and 
      second-order interactions among features. The classifiers were evaluated on a set of 
      856 epochs by means of 10-fold cross-validation. The best algorithm (random forests) 
      achieved a Matthews correlation coefficient, mean sensitivity, and mean specificity 
      of 0.921, 0.938, and 0.982, respectively.

AB  - A novel method has been proposed for the detection of ischemia using an isoelectric 
      energy function (IEEF) resulting from ST segment deviations in ECG signals. The 
      method consists of five stages: pre-processing, delineation, measurement of 
      isoelectric energy, a beat characterization algorithm and detection of ischemia. The 
      isoelectric energy threshold is used to differentiate ischemic beats from normal 
      beats for ischemic episode detection. Then, ischemic episodes are classified as 
      transmural or subendocardial. The method is validated for recordings of the 
      annotated European ST-T database (EDB). The results show 98.12% average sensitivity 
      (SE) and 98.16% average specificity (SP). These results are significantly better 
      than those of existing methods cited in the literature. The advantage of the 
      proposed method includes simplicity, ruggedness and automatic discarding of noisy 
      beats.

TI  - [Arrhythmia heartbeats classification based on neighborhood preserving embedding 
      algorithm].
PG  - 1-6
AB  - Arrhythmia is a kind of common cardiac electrical activity abnormalities. Heartbeats 
      classification based on electrocardiogram(ECG) is of great significance for clinical 
      diagnosis of arrhythmia. This paper proposes a feature extraction method based on 
      manifold learning, neighborhood preserving embedding(NPE) algorithm, to achieve the 
      automatic classification of arrhythmia heartbeats. With classification system, we 
      obtained low dimensional manifold structure features of high dimensional ECG signals 
      by NPE algorithm, then we inputted the feature vectors into support vector 
      machine(SVM) classifier for heartbeats diagnosis. Based on MIT-BIH arrhythmia 
      database, we clustered 14 classes of arrhythmia heartbeats in the experiment, which 
      yielded a high overall classification accuracy of 98.51%. Experimental result showed 
      that the proposed method was an effective classification method for arrhythmia 
      heartbeats.

AB  - This paper presents a generic programmable analog front-end (AFE) for acquisition 
      and digitization of various biopotential signals. This includes a lead-off detection 
      circuit, an ultra-low current capacitively coupled signal conditioning stage with 
      programmable gain and bandwidth, a new mixed signal automatic gain control (AGC) 
      mechanism and a medically cohesive reconfigurable ΣΔ ADC. The full system is 
      designed in UMC 0.18μm CMOS. The AFE achieves an overall linearity of more 10 bits 
      with 0.47μW power consumption. The ADC provides 2(nd) order noise-shaping while 
      using single integrator and an ENOB of ~11 bits with 5μW power consumption. The 
      system was successfully verified for various ECG signals from PTB database. This 
      system is intended for portable batteryless u-Healthcare devices.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In this study, we propose a method for automatically predicting atrial 
      fibrillation (AF) based on convolutional neural network (CNN) using a short-term 
      normal electrocardiogram (ECG) signal. METHODS: We designed a CNN model and 
      optimized it by dropout and normalization. One-dimensional convolution, max-pooling, 
      and fully-connected multiple perceptron were used to analyze the short-term normal 
      ECG. The ECG signal was preprocessed and segmented to train and evaluate the 
      proposed CNN model. The training and test sets consisted of the two AF and one 
      normal dataset from the MIT-BIH database. RESULTS: The proposed CNN model for the 
      automatic prediction of AF achieved a high performance with a sensitivity of 98.6%, 
      a specificity of 98.7%, and an accuracy of 98.7%. CONCLUSION: The results show the 
      possibility of automatically predicting AF based on the CNN model using a short-term 
      normal ECG signal. The proposed CNN model for the automatic prediction of AF can be 
      a helpful tool for the early diagnosis of AF in healthcare fields.

TI  - Instantaneous heart rate: should RR-intervals be resampled?
PG  - 277-82
LID - 10.1109/IEMBS.2008.4649144 [doi]
AB  - RR-interval sequences (tachograms) represent heart rate variability discretely. When 
      time series representations of instantaneous heart rate (IHR) are required, 
      tachograms are often resampled into a time series. This paper demonstrates that 
      traditional RR-interval resampling is often inconsistent with the time domain 
      constraints of the tachogram. A general technique, called frequency-modulated 
      phase-interpolation (FMPI), is presented that preserves the time domain constraints. 
      Results of FMPI in the synthesis of ECG signals with accurate event-interval 
      reconstruction are shown. Discussion of the model against IPFM and the heart timing 
      signal is presented. Consequences of the IHR reconstruction perspective to the 
      spectral characterization of heart rate variability are also introduced.

AB  - The heart begins to beat before the brain is formed. Whether conventional 
      hierarchical central commands sent by the brain to the heart alone explain all the 
      interplay between these two organs should be reconsidered. Here, we demonstrate 
      correlations between the signal complexity of brain and cardiac activity. 
      Eighty-seven geriatric outpatients with healthy hearts and varied cognitive 
      abilities each provided a 24-hour electrocardiography (ECG) and a 19-channel 
      eye-closed routine electroencephalography (EEG). Multiscale entropy (MSE) analysis 
      was applied to three epochs (resting-awake state, photic stimulation of fast 
      frequencies (fast-PS), and photic stimulation of slow frequencies (slow-PS)) of EEG 
      in the 1-58 Hz frequency range, and three RR interval (RRI) time series 
      (awake-state, sleep and that concomitant with the EEG) for each subject. The 
      low-to-high frequency power (LF/HF) ratio of RRI was calculated to represent 
      sympatho-vagal balance. With statistics after Bonferroni corrections, we found that: 
      (a) the summed MSE value on coarse scales of the awake RRI (scales 11-20, 
      RRI-MSE-coarse) were inversely correlated with the summed MSE value on coarse scales 
      of the resting-awake EEG (scales 6-20, EEG-MSE-coarse) at Fp2, C4, T6 and T4; (b) 
      the awake RRI-MSE-coarse was inversely correlated with the fast-PS EEG-MSE-coarse at 
      O1, O2 and C4; (c) the sleep RRI-MSE-coarse was inversely correlated with the 
      slow-PS EEG-MSE-coarse at Fp2; (d) the RRI-MSE-coarse and LF/HF ratio of the awake 
      RRI were correlated positively to each other; (e) the EEG-MSE-coarse at F8 was 
      proportional to the cognitive test score; (f) the results conform to the cholinergic 
      hypothesis which states that cognitive impairment causes reduction in vagal cardiac 
      modulation; (g) fast-PS significantly lowered the EEG-MSE-coarse globally. Whether 
      these heart-brain correlations could be fully explained by the central autonomic 
      network is unknown and needs further exploration.

LID - 10.1007/s40846-017-0247-z [doi]
AB  - The needs for light-weight and soft smart clothing in homecare have been rising 
      since the past decade. Many smart textile sensors have been developed and applied to 
      automatic physiological and user-centered environmental status recognition. In the 
      present study, we propose wearable multi-sensor smart clothing for homecare 
      monitoring based on an economic fabric electrode with high elasticity and low 
      resistance. The wearable smart clothing integrated with heterogeneous sensors is 
      capable to measure multiple human biosignals (ECG and respiration), acceleration, 
      and gyro information. Five independent respiratory signals (electric impedance 
      plethysmography, respiratory induced frequency variation, respiratory induced 
      amplitude variation, respiratory induced intensity variation, and respiratory 
      induced movement variation) are obtained. The smart clothing can provide accurate 
      respiratory rate estimation by using three different techniques (Naïve Bayes 
      inference, static Kalman filter, and dynamic Kalman filter). During the static 
      sitting experiments, respiratory induced frequency variation has the best 
      performance; whereas during the running experiments, respiratory induced amplitude 
      variation has the best performance. The Naïve Bayes inference and dynamic Kalman 
      filter have shown good results. The novel smart clothing is soft, elastic, and 
      washable and it is suitable for long-term monitoring in homecare medical service and 
      healthcare industry.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: . The electrocardiograms (ECGs) are widely used to 
      diagnose a variety of arrhythmias. Generally, the abnormalities of ECG signals 
      mainly consist of ill-shaped ECG beat morphologies and irregular intervals. The 
      ill-shaped ECG beat morphologies represent morphological information, while the 
      irregular intervals denote the temporal information of ECG signals. But it is 
      difficult to utilize morphological information and temporal information 
      simultaneously when dealing with single ECG heartbeats, because RR interval is not 
      contained in a single short heartbeat. Therefore, to handle this problems, a novel 
      Multi-information Fusion Convolutional Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Network 
      (MF-CBRNN) is proposed for arrhythmia automatic detection. METHODS: . The MF-CBRNN 
      is designed with two parallel hybrid branches that can simultaneously focus on the 
      beat-based information in the ECG beats and the segment-based information in the 
      adjacent segments of the beats. A single ECG beat provides the morphological 
      information. At the same time, the adjacent segment of the ECG beat enriches the 
      temporal information, so the two branches are designed to exploit the multiple 
      information contained in ECGs. Furthermore, a combination of convolutional neural 
      networks (CNNs) and a bidirectional long short memory (BLSTM) in each branch is 
      utilized to capture the information from the two inputs. And all the features 
      extracted from the two branches are fused for information aggregation. RESULTS: . To 
      evaluate the performance of the proposed model, the ECG signals from MIT-BIH 
      databases are used for intra-patient and inter-patient paradigms. The proposed model 
      yields an accuracy of 99.56% and an F1-score of 96.40% under the intra-patient 
      paradigm. And it obtains an overall accuracy of 96.77% and F1-score of 77.83% under 
      the inter-patient paradigm. CONCLUSIONS: . Compared with other studies on arrhythmia 
      detection, our method achieves a state-of-the-art performance. It indicates that the 
      proposed model is a promising arrhythmia detection algorithm for computer-aided 
      diagnostic systems.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is often detected for the first time in 
      patients hospitalized for medical illness or non-cardiovascular surgery. AF 
      occurring transiently with stress (AFOTS) describes this manifestation of AF, which 
      may either be the result of a non-cardiac stressor, or existing paroxysmal AF that 
      was not previously detected. Current estimates of AFOTS incidence are imprecise: 
      ranging from 1 to 44%, owing to the marked heterogeneity in patient populations, 
      identification and methods used to detect AFOTS. METHODS: The prospective, 
      two-centre epidemiological AFOTS Incidence study will enroll 250 consecutive 
      participants without a history of AF but with at increased risk of AF (Age ≥ 65 or 
      >50 with one risk factor for AF) admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) for medical 
      illness or non-cardiac surgery. Upon admission, participants will wear an ECG patch 
      monitor that will remain in place for 14 days, or until discharge from hospital. 
      Patients' consent to participation is deferred for up to 72 h after admission. The 
      primary endpoint is the incidence of AF lasting ≥30 s. The study is powered to 
      detect an AF incidence of 17% ± 5%. RESULTS: We conducted a vanguard feasibility 
      study, and 55 participants have completed participation. The median duration of 
      monitoring was seven days. AF was detected by the clinical team in 8 participants 
      (14%; 95% Confidence Interval 7-26%). CONCLUSIONS: The AFOTS Incidence study will 
      employ a systematic and highly sensitive protocol for detecting AFOTS in medical 
      illness and non-cardiac surgery ICU patients. This study is feasible and will 
      provide a reliable estimate of the true incidence of AFOTS in this population.

AB  - Accurate R peak detection in the electrocardiogram (ECG) is a well-known and highly 
      explored problem in biomedical signal processing. Although a lot of progress has 
      been made in this area, current methods are still insufficient in the presence of 
      extreme noise and/or artifacts such as loose electrodes. Often, however, not only 
      the ECG is recorded, but multiple signals are simultaneously acquired from the 
      patient. Several of these signals, such as blood pressure, can help to improve the 
      heart beat detection. These signals of interest can be detected automatically by 
      analyzing their power spectral density or by using the available signal type 
      identifiers. Individual peaks from the signals of interest are combined using 
      majority voting, heart beat location estimation and Hjorth's mobility of the 
      resulting RR intervals. Both multimodal algorithms showed significant increases in 
      performance of up to 8.65% for noisy multimodal datasets compared to when only the 
      ECG signal is used. A maximal performance of 90.02% was obtained on the hidden test 
      set of the Physionet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2014: Robust Detection of 
      Heart Beats in Multimodal Data.

AB  - Electrocardiogram (ECG) classification is an important process in identifying 
      arrhythmia, and neural network models have been widely used in this field. However, 
      these models are often disrupted by heartbeat noise and are negatively affected by 
      skewed data. To address these problems, a novel heartbeat recognition method is 
      presented. The aim of this study is to apply a principal component analysis network 
      (PCANet) for feature extraction based on a noisy ECG signal. To improve the 
      classification speed, a linear support vector machine (SVM) was applied. In our 
      experiments, we identified five types of imbalanced original and noise-free ECGs in 
      the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database to verify the effectiveness of our algorithm and 
      achieved 97.77% and 97.08% accuracy, respectively. The results show that our method 
      has high recognition accuracy in the classification of skewed and noisy heartbeats, 
      indicating that our method is a practical ECG recognition method with suitable noise 
      robustness and skewed data applicability.

TI  - An Automatic R and T peak Detection Method Based on the Combination of Hierarchical 
      Clustering and Discrete Wavelet Transform.
LID - 10.1109/JBHI.2020.2973982 [doi]
AB  - The detection and delineation of QRS-complexes and T-waves in electrocardiogram 
      (ECG) is an important task because these features are associated with the cardiac 
      abnormalities including ventricular arrhythmias that may lead to sudden cardiac 
      death. In this paper, we propose a novel method for the R-peak and the T-peak 
      detection using hierarchical clustering and discrete wavelet transform (DWT) from 
      the ECG signal. In the first step, a template of the single ECG beat is identified. 
      Secondly, all R-peaks are detected by using hierarchical clustering. Then, each 
      corresponding T-wave boundary is delineated based on the template morphology. 
      Finally, the determination of T wave peaks is achieved based on the modulus-maxima 
      analysis (MMA) of the DWT coefficients. We evaluated the algorithm by using all 
      records from the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database and QT database. The R-peak detector 
      achieved a sensitivity of 99.89%, a positive predictivity of 99.97% and 99.83% 
      accuracy over the validation MIT-BIH database. In addition, it shows a sensitivity 
      of 100%, a positive predictivity of 99.83% in manually annotated QT database. It 
      also shows 99.92% sensitivity and 99.96% positive predictivity over the automatic 
      annotated QT database. In terms of the T-peak detection, our algorithm is verified 
      with 99.91% sensitivity and 99.38% positive predictivity in manually annotated QT 
      database.

TI  - Atrial fibrillation detection using an iPhone 4S.
PG  - 203-6
LID - 10.1109/TBME.2012.2208112 [doi]
AB  - Atrial fibrillation (AF) affects three to five million Americans and is associated 
      with significant morbidity and mortality. Existing methods to diagnose this 
      paroxysmal arrhythmia are cumbersome and/or expensive. We hypothesized that an 
      iPhone 4S can be used to detect AF based on its ability to record a pulsatile 
      photoplethysmogram signal from a fingertip using the built-in camera lens. To 
      investigate the capability of the iPhone 4S for AF detection, we first used two 
      databases, the MIT-BIH AF and normal sinus rhythm (NSR) to derive discriminatory 
      threshold values between two rhythms. Both databases include RR time series 
      originating from 250 Hz sampled ECG recordings. We rescaled the RR time series to 
      30 Hz so that the RR time series resolution is 1/30 (s) which is equivalent to the 
      resolution from an iPhone 4S. We investigated three statistical methods consisting 
      of the root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD), the Shannon entropy (ShE) 
      and the sample entropy (SampE), which have been proved to be useful tools for AF 
      assessment. Using 64-beat segments from the MIT-BIH databases, we found the 
      beat-to-beat accuracy value of 0.9405, 0.9300, and 0.9614 for RMSSD, ShE, and SampE, 
      respectively. Using an iPhone 4S, we collected 2-min pulsatile time series from 25 
      prospectively recruited subjects with AF pre- and postelectrical cardioversion. 
      Using derived threshold values of RMSSD, ShE and SampE from the MIT-BIH databases, 
      we found the beat-to-beat accuracy of 0.9844, 0.8494, and 0.9522, respectively. It 
      should be recognized that for clinical applications, the most relevant objective is 
      to detect the presence of AF in the data. Using this criterion, we achieved an 
      accuracy of 100% for both the MIT-BIH AF and iPhone 4S databases.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop and evaluate an algorithm for the selection of the 
      best-performing QRS detections from multiple algorithms and ECG leads. APPROACH: The 
      detections produced by several publicly available single-lead QRS detectors are 
      segmented in 20 s consecutive windows; then a statistical model is trained to 
      estimate a quality metric that is used to rank each 20 s segment of detections. The 
      model describes each heartbeat in terms of six features calculated from the RR 
      interval series, and one feature proportional to the number of heartbeats detected 
      in other leads in a neighborhood of the current heartbeat. With the highest ranked 
      segments, we defined several lead selection strategies (LSS) that were evaluated in 
      a set of 1754 ECG recordings from 14 ECG databases. The LSS proposed were compared 
      with simple strategies such as selecting lead II or the first lead available in a 
      recording. The performance was calculated in terms of the average sensitivity, 
      positive predictive value, and F score. MAIN RESULTS: The best-performing LSS, based 
      on wavedet algorithm, achieved an F score of 98.7, with sensitivity S  =  99.2 and 
      positive predictive value P  =  98.3. The F score for the simpler strategy using the 
      same algorithm was 92.7. The LSS studied in this work have been made available in an 
      open-source toolbox to ease the reproducibility and result comparison. SIGNIFICANCE: 
      The results suggest that the use of LSS is convenient for purposes of selecting the 
      best heartbeat locations among those provided by different detectors in different 
      leads, obtaining better results than any of the algorithms individually.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Heartbeats Holter monitoring is important for the 
      detection of arrhythmias and possible anomalies, which are predictive of 
      cardiovascular risks and infections. Reducing the number of acquired samples is 
      useful to save energy and memory, but a proper down-sampling schedule is needed to 
      record all useful information. Method An adaptive algorithm for the non-uniform 
      down-sampling of data is used to reduce the mean sampling frequency of ECG data. The 
      acquired data are processed to extract RR rhythm and to classify the heartbeats 
      among a set of possible types of arrhythmias. RESULTS: The proposed method is tested 
      in terms of the ability to estimate the heart rate and to classify the heartbeats 
      from the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia data down-sampled below the Nyquist limit. The mean 
      accuracy in identifying the heartbeats was over the 98% and the RMS error in 
      estimating the RR time series was lower than the 1%. Variability, spectral and 
      complexity indexes extracted from RR series were estimated with a mean error that 
      was lower than 10%. Classification accuracy was above the 95%. CONCLUSIONS: An 
      adaptive method to down-sample ECG data is discussed. It can be useful to save 
      energy and to reduce memory occupation, while still preserving important information 
      on the heartbeats.

      intracranial pressure.
PG  - 01LT01
LID - 10.1088/1361-6579/aafab1 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Cerebrovascular reactivity (CR) is a mechanism that maintains stable 
      blood flow supply to the brain. Pressure reactivity index (PRx), the correlation 
      coefficient between slow waves of invasive arterial blood pressure (ABP) and 
      intracranial pressure (ICP) has been validated for CR assessment. However, in 
      clinical ward, not every subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) patient has invasive ABP 
      monitoring. Pulse transit time (PTT), the propagation time of a pulse wave 
      travelling from the heart to peripheral arteries, has been suggested as a surrogate 
      measure of ABP. In this study, we proposed to use PTT instead of invasive ABP to 
      monitor CR. APPROACH: Forty-five SAH patients with simultaneous recordings of 
      invasive ABP, ICP, oxygen saturation level (SpO2) and electrocardiograph (ECG) were 
      included. PTT was calculated as the time from the ECG R-wave peak to the onset of 
      SpO2. PTT based pressure reactivity index (tPRx) was calculated as the correlation 
      coefficient between slow waves of PTT and ICP. Wavelet tPRx (wtRx) was calculated as 
      the cosine of wavelet phase shift between PTT and ICP. Meanwhile, PRx and wPRx were 
      also calculated using invasive ABP and ICP as input. MAIN RESULTS: The result showed 
      a negative relationship between PTT and ABP (r  =  -0.58, p   <  0.001). tPRx 
      negatively correlated with PRx (r  =  -0.51, p   =  0.003). Wavelet method 
      correlated well with correlation method demonstrated through positive relationship 
      between wPRx and PRx (r  =  0.82, p   <  0.001) as well as wtPRx and tPRx 
      (r  =  0.84, p   <  0.001). SIGNIFICANCE: PTT demonstrates great potential as a 
      useful tool for CR assessment when invasive ABP is unavailable. Key points • Pulse 
      transit time (PTT), defined as the propagation time of a pulse wave travelling from 
      the heart to the peripheral arteries, has been proposed as a surrogate measure of 
      ABP. The relationship between PTT and ABP in SAH patients remains unknown. • 
      Cerebrovascular reactivity (CR) assessment through PTT has advantages over invasive 
      ABP, as it avoids bleeding and infection risk, and can be used outside of the ICU. • 
      We introduced a new method to assess CR using PTT and ICP through correlation based 
      method and wavelet based method. • We found that beat-to-beat PTT was negatively 
      related with invasive ABP in SAH patients. A significant linear relationship exists 
      between PTT-based CR parameter and a well validated method, PRx. PTT demonstrates 
      great potential as a useful tool for CR assessment when invasive ABP is unavailable 
      in SAH patients.

TI  - Time Series Analysis Using Geometric Template Matching.
PG  - 740-54
LID - 10.1109/TPAMI.2012.121 [doi]
AB  - We present a novel framework for analyzing univariate time series data. At the heart 
      of the approach is a versatile algorithm for measuring the similarity of two 
      segments of time series called geometric template matching (GeTeM). First, we use 
      GeTeM to compute a similarity measure for clustering and nearest-neighbor 
      classification. Next, we present a semi-supervised learning algorithm that uses the 
      similarity measure with hierarchical clustering in order to improve classification 
      performance when unlabeled training data are available. Finally, we present a 
      boosting framework called TDEBOOST, which uses an ensemble of GeTeM classifiers. 
      TDEBOOST augments the traditional boosting approach with an additional step in which 
      the features used as inputs to the classifier are adapted at each step to improve 
      the training error. We empirically evaluate the proposed approaches on several 
      datasets, such as accelerometer data collected from wearable sensors and ECG data.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Early neonatal death is a worldwide challenge with 1 
      million newborn deaths every year. The primary cause of these deaths are 
      complications during labour and birth asphyxia. The majority of these newborns could 
      have been saved with adequate resuscitation at birth. Newborn resuscitation 
      guidelines recommend immediate drying, stimulation, suctioning if indicated, and 
      ventilation of non-breathing newborns. A system that will automatically detect and 
      extract time periods where different resuscitation activities are performed, would 
      be highly beneficial to evaluate what resuscitation activities that are improving 
      the state of the newborn, and if current guidelines are good and if they are 
      followed. The potential effects of especially stimulation are not very well 
      documented as it has been difficult to investigate through observations. In this 
      paper the main objective is to identify stimulation activities, regardless if the 
      state of the newborn is changed or not, and produce timelines of the resuscitation 
      episode with the identified stimulations. METHODS: Data is collected by utilizing a 
      new heart rate device, NeoBeat, with dry-electrode ECG and accelerometer sensors 
      placed on the abdomen of the newborn. We propose a method, NBstim, based on time 
      domain and frequency domain features from the accelerometer signals and ECG signals 
      from NeoBeat, to detect time periods of stimulation. NBstim use causal features from 
      a gliding window of the signals, thus it can potentially be used in future realtime 
      systems. A high performing feature subset is found using feature selection. System 
      performance is computed using a leave-one-out cross-validation and compared with 
      manual annotations. RESULTS: The system achieves an overall accuracy of 90.3% when 
      identifying regions with stimulation activities. CONCLUSION: The performance 
      indicates that the proposed NBstim, used with signals from the NeoBeat can be used 
      to determine when stimulation is performed. The provided activity timelines, in 
      combination with the status of the newborn, for example the heart rate, at different 
      time points, can be studied further to investigate both the time spent and the 
      effect of different newborn resuscitation parameters.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is common and may have severe consequences. 
      Continuous long-term electrocardiogram (ECG) is widely used for AF screening. 
      Recently, commercial ECG analysis software was launched, which automatically detects 
      AF in long-term ECGs. It has been claimed that such tools offer reliable AF 
      screening and save time for ECG analysis. However, this has not been investigated in 
      a real-life patient cohort. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the performance of automatic 
      software-based screening for AF in long-term ECGs. METHODS: Two independent 
      physicians manually screened 22,601 hours of continuous long-term ECGs from 150 
      patients for AF. Presence, number, and duration of AF episodes were registered. 
      Subsequently, the recordings were screened for AF by an established ECG analysis 
      software (Pathfinder SL), and its performance was validated against the thorough 
      manual analysis (gold standard). RESULTS: Sensitivity and specificity for AF 
      detection was 98.5% (95% confidence interval 91.72%-99.96%) and 80.21% (95% 
      confidence interval 70.83%-87.64%), respectively. Software-based AF detection was 
      inferior to manual analysis by physicians (P < .0001). Median AF duration was 
      underestimated (19.4 hours vs 22.1 hours; P < .001) and median number of AF episodes 
      was overestimated (32 episodes vs 2 episodes; P < .001) by the software. In 
      comparison to extensive quantitative manual ECG analysis, software-based analysis 
      saved time (2 minutes vs 19 minutes; P < .001). CONCLUSION: Owing to its high 
      sensitivity and ability to save time, software-based ECG analysis may be used as a 
      screening tool for AF. An additional manual confirmatory analysis may be required to 
      reduce the number of false-positive findings.

AB  - Camera-based measurement of the blood volume pulse via non-contact, imaging 
      photoplethysmography is a very popular approach for measuring pulse rate using a 
      remote imaging sensor. Comparatively less attention has been paid to the usefulness 
      of the method for measuring features of pulse rate variability, and even less focus 
      has been put on the accuracy of any cardiac activity feature that can be achieved at 
      long imager-to-subject distances. In this study, video was recorded from 19 
      participants, while at rest, at a distance of 25 meters from the imaging sensor. A 
      digital camera was used to record video while cardiovascular measures of both 
      electrical and optical physiological ground truth were recorded. Pulse rate data 
      obtained from the imager using a common blind source separation and periodogram 
      approach were compared to physiological ground truth signals. The quality of the 
      recovered blood volume pulse morphology was sufficient to calculate time-domain 
      measures of pulse rate using inter-pulse interval (IPI) time series. Following this, 
      several features of pulse rate variability were calculated from the IPI time series 
      and compared to those calculated from the corresponding physiological ground truth 
      signals. Use of the time-domain data as compared to the periodogram approach to 
      measure pulse rate reduced the error in the estimate from 1.6 to 0.2 beats per 
      minute. Correlation analysis (r2) between the camera-based measures of pulse rate 
      variability and ECG-derived heart rate variability ranged from 0.779 to 0.973; these 
      results are of comparable outcome to those obtained at imager-to-subject distances 
      of no more than 3 meters. This study demonstrates that pulse rates of less than one 
      beat-per-minute error can be obtained when the recovered blood volume pulse 
      morphology is of adequate quality to resolve systolic onsets for individual cardiac 
      cycles. Further, this approach can yield data of very promising quality for 
      estimating measures of pulse rate variability.

TI  - A wavelet-based electrogram onset delineator for automatic ventricular activation 
      mapping.
PG  - 2830-9
LID - 10.1109/TBME.2014.2330847 [doi]
AB  - Electroanatomical mapping (EAM) systems are commonly used in clinical practice for 
      guiding catheter ablation treatments of common arrhythmias. In focal tachycardias, 
      the ablation target is defined by locating the earliest activation area determined 
      by the joint analysis of electrogram (EGM) signals at different sites. However, this 
      is currently a manual time-consuming and experience-dependent task performed during 
      the intervention and thus prone to stress-related errors. In this paper, we present 
      an automatic delineation strategy that combines electrocardiogram (ECG) information 
      with the wavelet decomposition of the EGM signal envelope to identify the onset of 
      each EGM signal for activation mapping. Fourteen electroanatomical maps 
      corresponding to ten patients suffering from non-tolerated premature ventricular 
      contraction (PVC) beats and admitted for ablation procedure were used for 
      evaluation. We compared the results obtained automatically with two types of manual 
      annotations: one during the intervention by an expert technician (on-procedure) and 
      other after the intervention (off-procedure), free from time and procedural 
      constraints, by two other technicians. The automatic annotations show a significant 
      correlation (0.95, p 0.01) with the evaluation reference (off-procedure annotation 
      sets combination) and has an error of 2.1 ± 10.9 ms, around the order of magnitude 
      of the on-procedure annotations error ( - 2.6 ± 6.8 ms). The results suggest that 
      the proposed methodology could be incorporated into EAM systems to considerably 
      reduce processing time during ablation interventions.

TI  - Towards precise tracking of electric-mechanical cardiac time intervals through joint 
      ECG and BCG sensing and signal processing.
PG  - 751-754
LID - 10.1109/EMBC.2017.8036933 [doi]
AB  - Automatic tracking of intra-beat cardiac activities in ballistocardiogram (BCG) is a 
      highly interesting yet technically challenging topic for cardiac monitoring, due to 
      the signal's high susceptibility to various forms of distortions. In this paper, we 
      aim to further investigate the BCG waveform detection from a signal processing and 
      analysis viewpoint. We collect synchronized electrocardiography(ECG) and BCG 
      recordings from four healthy human subjects using an in-house built 
      multi-physiological monitoring device. Particularly, we study post-exercise ECG-BCG 
      signals that embed considerable variation in the heart beat during the post-exercise 
      recovery phase. Furthermore, we develop an efficient and interactive tool for 
      detecting and marking ECG-BCG waveforms in each heart beat. Through analyzing the 
      detected time interval signals, we explore new interesting patterns of dynamic 
      associations between different time interval signals. At the same time, we call for 
      development of improved detection algorithms to address robustness and accuracy 
      issues.

TI  - Assessment of the feasibility of an ultra-low power, wireless digital patch for the 
      continuous ambulatory monitoring of vital signs.
PG  - e006606
LID - 10.1136/bmjopen-2014-006606 [doi]
LID - e006606
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Vital signs are usually recorded at 4-8 h intervals in 
      hospital patients, and deterioration between measurements can have serious 
      consequences. The primary study objective was to assess agreement between a new 
      ultra-low power, wireless and wearable surveillance system for continuous ambulatory 
      monitoring of vital signs and a widely used clinical vital signs monitor. The 
      secondary objective was to examine the system's ability to automatically identify 
      and reject invalid physiological data. SETTING: Single hospital centre. 
      PARTICIPANTS: Heart and respiratory rate were recorded over 2 h in 20 patients 
      undergoing elective surgery and a second group of 41 patients with comorbid 
      conditions, in the general ward. OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome measures were 
      limits of agreement and bias. The secondary outcome measure was proportion of data 
      rejected. RESULTS: The digital patch provided reliable heart rate values in the 
      majority of patients (about 80%) with normal sinus rhythm, and in the presence of 
      abnormal ECG recordings (excluding aperiodic arrhythmias such as atrial 
      fibrillation). The mean difference between systems was less than ±1 bpm in all 
      patient groups studied. Although respiratory data were more frequently rejected as 
      invalid because of the high sensitivity of impedance pneumography to motion 
      artefacts, valid rates were reported for 50% of recordings with a mean difference of 
      less than ±1 brpm compared with the bedside monitor. Correlation between systems was 
      statistically significant (p<0.0001) for heart and respiratory rate, apart from 
      respiratory rate in patients with atrial fibrillation (p=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Overall 
      agreement between digital patch and clinical monitor was satisfactory, as was the 
      efficacy of the system for automatic rejection of invalid data. Wireless monitoring 
      technologies, such as the one tested, may offer clinical value when implemented as 
      part of wider hospital systems that integrate and support existing clinical 
      protocols and workflows.

AB  - Apple launched a novel feature of the Apple Watch (Apple Inc.) series 4 that enables 
      consumers to record a rhythm strip and assist with self-diagnosis of atrial 
      fibrillation (AF). The watch is paired with an app that provides automatic 
      classification of the rhythm. Ability of the algorithm to identify AF has received 
      Food and Drug Administration clearance. Given increasing use of direct-to-consumer 
      devices, important questions regarding the utilization of such devices and their 
      features in clinical practice arise. It is unclear how the data obtained from these 
      devices can be optimally incorporated in patient care and what it means for 
      patients. Safety and security of using wearables are also of concern. Furthermore, 
      whether data generated from the Electrocardiogram (ECG) feature will be beneficial 
      to public health is to be determined. We discuss possible uses and challenges of 
      Apple's (Apple Inc.) newly launched ECG feature and review an upcoming trial looking 
      at clinical applications and outcomes using this technology. We also review the 
      literature on the Kardia (AliveCor Inc.) mobile and smartwatch ECG technology and 
      briefly discuss Apple Watch irregular heartbeat notifications along with the Apple 
      Heart Study.

TI  - Decision Tree Predictive Learner-Based Approach for False Alarm Detection in ICU.
PG  - 191
LID - 10.1007/s10916-019-1337-y [doi]
AB  - In this work, a novel method has been proposed for false alarm detection in 
      Intensive Care Unit (ICU) during arrhythmia. To detect false alarm, various inputs 
      are used such as electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, atrial blood pressure (ABP), 
      photoplethysmogram signals (PLETH) and respiration (RESP). The inputs are given to 
      decision tree predictive learner (DTPL) based classifier for thedetection of false 
      alarm. The proposed method has an accuracy of 97% for prediction of false alarm in 
      ICU. Theresult of the proposed method is promising which suggest that it can be used 
      effectively for false alarm detection in ICUs. To the best of our knowledge, there 
      is no such assumption based classification approach.

TI  - Evaluation of an algorithm for highly automated measurements of QT interval.
PG  - 16-24
LID - 10.1016/j.vascn.2011.05.004 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Noise, artifact, and labile morphology of ECGs collected from freely 
      moving animals in safety pharmacology studies render accurate measurements of QT 
      interval challenging. Consequently, a high percentage of beats are uninterpretable 
      and results provided by currently available analysis algorithms often require 
      extensive manual review to correct errors. Performance of a novel algorithm, 
      Multi-Domain Signal Processing™ (MDSP), is evaluated as a means of removing noise 
      (denoising) without distorting morphology and for obtaining accurate beat-to-beat QT 
      measurements. METHODS: Performance was evaluated using controlled experiments and an 
      observational evaluation as follows: a) a clean ECG strip was intentionally 
      corrupted with varying levels of noise to provide recordings of known 
      signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). SNR and fidelity were compared pre- and post-MDSP 
      denoising, b) beat-to-beat QT of a noisy ECG was measured manually pre- and 
      post-MDSP denoising and automatically by MDSP, c) beat-to-beat QT of a clean ECG was 
      measured manually and automatically using MDSP, and d) beat-to-beat QT was computed 
      for 3 freely moving non-human primates (NHP) pre- and post-torsadogen administration 
      and the impact of averaging on QTSD, QT/RR dynamics and relationship was evaluated. 
      RESULTS: MDSP reduced noise amplitude by up to 85% while preserving signal 
      morphology. Mean QTs for manual and automatic measurements on a noisy ECG were 
      within 2±15ms. MDSP-denoising prior to manual QT measurements resulted in a 22% 
      decrease in QTSD compared to measurements obtained without denoising. Average QT 
      standard deviation of the mean (QTSD) for automatic MDSP-derived measurements for 3 
      freely moving subjects was 7ms with 2.5% of beats automatically excluded due to 
      noise. DISCUSSION: This work demonstrates that the MDSP algorithm shows promise as a 
      tool for providing accurate automatic beat-to-beat measurements of QT interval from 
      NHP in safety pharmacology studies. A methodology is presented for characterizing 
      the impact of noise on algorithm performance.

TI  - Spatial variability of the 12-lead surface ECG as a tool for noninvasive prediction 
      of catheter ablation outcome in persistent atrial fibrillation.
PG  - 20-7

AB  - Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia encountered 
      in clinical practice. Radiofrequency catheter ablation (CA) is increasingly employed 
      to treat this disease, yet the selection of persistent AF patients who will benefit 
      from this treatment remains a challenging task. Several parameters of the surface 
      electrocardiogram (ECG) have been analyzed in previous works to predict AF 
      termination by CA, such as fibrillatory wave (f-wave) amplitude. However, they are 
      usually manually computed and only a subset of electrodes is inspected. In this 
      study, a novel perspective of the role of f-wave amplitude as a potential 
      noninvasive predictor of CA outcome is adopted by exploring ECG interlead spatial 
      variability. An automatic procedure for atrial amplitude computation based on cubic 
      Hermite interpolation is first proposed. To describe the global f-wave peak-to-peak 
      amplitude distribution, signal contributions from multiple leads are then combined 
      by condensing the most representative features of the atrial signal in a 
      reduced-rank approximation based on principal component analysis (PCA). We show that 
      exploiting ECG spatial diversity by means of this PCA-based multilead approach does 
      not only increase the robustness to electrode selection, but also substantially 
      improves the predictive power of the amplitude parameter.

TI  - A practical algorithm to reduce false critical ECG alarms using arterial blood 
      pressure and/or photoplethysmogram waveforms.
PG  - 1355-69
LID - 10.1088/0967-3334/37/8/1355 [doi]
AB  - There has been a high rate of false alarms for the critical electrocardiogram (ECG) 
      arrhythmia events in intensive care units (ICUs), from which the 'crying-wolf' 
      syndrome may be resulted and patient safety may be jeopardized. This article 
      presents an algorithm to reduce false critical arrhythmia alarms using arterial 
      blood pressure (ABP) and/or photoplethysmogram (PPG) waveform features. We 
      established long duration reference alarm datasets which consist of 573 ICU 
      waveform-alarm records (283 for development set and 290 for test set) with total 
      length of 551 patent days. Each record has continuous recordings of ECGs, ABP and/or 
      PPG signals and contains one or multiple critical ECG alarms. The average length of 
      a record is 23 h. There are totally 2408 critical ECG alarms (1414 in the 
      development set and 994 in the test set), each of which was manually annotated by 
      experts. The algorithm extracts ABP/PPG pulse features on a beat-by-beat basis. For 
      each pulse, five event feature indicators (EFIs), which correspond to the five 
      critical ECG alarms, are generated. At the time of a critical ECG alarm, the 
      corresponding EFI values of those ABP/PPG pulses around the alarm time are checked 
      for adjudicating (accept/reject) this alarm. The algorithm retains all (100%) the 
      true alarms and significantly reduces the false alarms. Our results suggest that the 
      algorithm is effective and practical on account of its real-time dynamic processing 
      mechanism and computational efficiency.

TI  - Detection of spontaneous pulse using the acceleration signals acquired from CPR 
      feedback sensor in a porcine model of cardiac arrest.
PG  - e0189217

LID - e0189217
AB  - BACKGROUND: Reliable detection of return of spontaneous circulation with minimal 
      interruptions of chest compressions is part of high-quality cardiopulmonary 
      resuscitation (CPR) and routinely done by checking pulsation of carotid arteries. 
      However, manual palpation was time-consuming and unreliable even if performed by 
      expert clinicians. Therefore, automated accurate pulse detection with minimal 
      interruptions of chest compression is highly desirable during cardiac arrest 
      especially in out-of-hospital settings. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether the 
      acceleration (ACC) signals acquired from accelerometer-based CPR feedback sensor can 
      be used to distinguish perfusing rhythm (PR) from pulseless electrical activity 
      (PEA) in a porcine model of cardiac arrest. METHODS: Cardiac arrest was induced in 
      49 male adult pigs. ECG, arterial blood pressure (ABP) and ACC waveforms were 
      simultaneously recorded during CPR. 3-second segments containing compression-free 
      signals during chest compression pauses were extracted and only those segments with 
      organized rhythm were used for analysis. PR was defined as systolic arterial 
      pressure >60 mmHg and pulse pressure >10 mmHg, while PEA was defined as an organized 
      rhythm that does not meet the above criteria for PR. Peak correlation coefficient 
      (CCp) of the cross-correlation function between pre-processed ECG and ACC, was used 
      to discriminate PR and PEA. RESULTS: 63 PR and 153 PEA were identified from the 
      total of 1025 extracted segments. CCp was significantly higher for PR as compared to 
      PEA (0.440±0.176 vs. 0.067±0.042, p<0.01) and highly correlated with ABP (r = 0.848, 
      p<0.001). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, sensitivity, 
      specificity and accuracy were 0.965, 93.6%, 97.5% and 96.7% for the ACC-based 
      automatic spontaneous pulse detection. CONCLUSIONS: In this animal model, the ACC 
      signals acquired from an accelerometer-based CPR feedback sensor can be used to 
      detect the presence of spontaneous pulse with high accuracy.

TI  - Alternating light-darkness-influenced human electrocardiographic magnetoreception in 
      association with geomagnetic pulsations.
PG  - 63s-75s
AB  - Geomagnetic variations of partly interplanetary origin, with cyclic signatures in 
      human affairs and pathology include the incidence of various diseases, regarding 
      which this study of healthy subjects attempted to determine an underlying mechanism 
      by worldwide archival and physiological monitoring, notably of heart rate 
      variability (HRV). In the past half-century, the possible health and other hazards 
      of natural, solar variability-driven temporal variations in the earth's magnetic 
      field have become a controversial subject in view of the inconsistent results. Some 
      well-documented claims of associations between geomagnetic storms and myocardial 
      infarction or stroke have been rejected by a study based on more comprehensive data 
      analyzed by rigorous methods - covering, however, only part of a solar cycle in only 
      part of a hemisphere. It seems possible that inter-solar cycle and geographic 
      variability, if not geographic differences, may account for discrepancies. Herein, 
      we examine the start of a planetary study on any influence of geomagnetic 
      disturbances that are most pronounced in the auroral oval, on human HRV. The 
      magnetic field variations exhibit complex spectra and include the frequency band 
      between 0.001-10 Hz, which is regarded as ultra-low frequency by physicists. Since 
      the 'ultra-low-frequency' range, like other endpoints used in cardiology, refers to 
      much higher frequencies than the about-yearly changes that are here shown to play a 
      role in environmental-organismic interactions revealed by HRV, the current 
      designations used in cardiology are all placed in quotation marks to indicate the 
      need for possible revision. Whether or not this suggestion has an immediate 
      response, we have pointed to a need for the development of instrumentation and 
      software that renders the assessment of circadian, infradian and even infra-annual 
      (truly low frequency) modulations routinely feasible. HRV was examined on the basis 
      of nearly continuous 7-day records by ECG between December 10, 1998, and November 2, 
      2000, on 19 clinically healthy subjects, 21 to 54 years of age, in Alta, Norway. A 
      geomagnetic record was obtained from the Auroral Observatory of the University of 
      Tromsø. First, frequency-domain measures of HRV were compared for each person in 
      24-hour spans of high geomagnetic disturbance versus quiet conditions. Second, 
      cross-spectra between geomagnetic activity and HRV measures were quantified via the 
      squared coherence spectrum using 7-day time series. A 7.5% increase in the 24-hour 
      average of heart rate, HR (P = 0.00020) and a decrease in HRV were documented on 
      days of high geomagnetic disturbance. The decrease in HRV was validated 
      statistically for the 'total frequency', 'TF' endpoint (18.6% decrease, P= 0.00009). 
      The decrease in spectral power was found primarily in the 'circaminutan frequency', 
      'VLF' (21.9% decrease, P< 0.000001) in conjunction with the 'minutes-to-hours' 
      component, ultra-low-frequency, 'ULF' (15.5% decrease, P= 0.00865) and 
      circadecasecundan 'low frequency', 'LF' (14.2% decrease, P = 0.00187) regions of the 
      spectrum. Power-law scaling of the power spectra did not show any statistically 
      significant difference. It is noteworthy that most of the decrease in HRV, except 
      for the circaminutan (VLF) component, was observed only in the season in which 
      sunshine alternated with darkness (D/L), a finding suggesting a mechanism influenced 
      by the alternation of light and darkness. The hypothesis of a light-dark-influenced 
      magnetoreception was also supported by cross-spectral analysis. Group-averaged 
      coherence at frequencies coincident with the geomagnetic Pc 6 pulsations (with 
      periods ranging from 10 minutes to 5 hours) differed with a statistical significance 
      (P < 0.000001) among the three natural lighting conditions, the association being 
      weaker during UL or D/D than during D/L. By contrast, no statistically significant 
      differences were found in terms of the circadian and circasemidian frequencies in 
      relation to the alternation of sunshine with darkness or rather circannual rhythm 
      stage. In conclusion, evidence is provided herein that an alteration of HRV is most 
      apparent in the circaminutan ('VLF') region, which is clinically important, because 
      a reduction in its power is a predictor of morbidity and mortality from 
      cardiovascular disease. The circadecasecundan ('LF') component of HRV also decreased 
      in association with geomagnetic disturbance, which may reflect an episodic 
      alteration of arterial pressure related to changes in geomagnetic activity. Lastly, 
      our study suggests the existence of a light-dark-influenced magnetoreception 
      mechanism in humans involving mainly the Pc 6 band of the magnetic field.

AB  - Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common arrhythmia disease. Detection of atrial 
      fibrillation based on electrocardiogram (ECG) is of great significance for clinical 
      diagnosis. Due to the non-linearity and complexity of ECG signals, the procedure to 
      manually diagnose the ECG signals takes a lot of time and is prone to errors. In 
      order to overcome the above problems, a feature extraction method based on RR 
      interval is proposed in this paper. The discrete degree of RR interval is described 
      with the robust coefficient of variation (RCV), the distribution shape of RR 
      interval is described with the skewness parameter (SKP), and the complexity of RR 
      interval is described with the Lempel-Ziv complexity (LZC). Finally, the feature 
      vectors of RCV, SKP, and LZC are input into the support vector machine (SVM) 
      classifier model to achieve automatic classification and detection of atrial 
      fibrillation. To verify the validity and practicability of the proposed method, the 
      MIT-BIH atrial fibrillation database was used to verify the data. The final 
      classification results show that the sensitivity is 95.81%, the specificity is 
      96.48%, the accuracy is 96.09%, and the specificity of 95.16% is achieved in the 
      MIT-BIH normal sinus rhythm database. The experimental results show that the 
      proposed method is an effective classification method for atrial fibrillation.

TI  - An automatic classifier of emotions built from entropy of noise.

AB  - The electrocardiogram (ECG) signal has been widely used to study the physiological 
      substrates of emotion. However, searching for better filtering techniques in order 
      to obtain a signal with better quality and with the maximum relevant information 
      remains an important issue for researchers in this field. Signal processing is 
      largely performed for ECG analysis and interpretation, but this process can be 
      susceptible to error in the delineation phase. In addition, it can lead to the loss 
      of important information that is usually considered as noise and, consequently, 
      discarded from the analysis. The goal of this study was to evaluate if the ECG noise 
      allows for the classification of emotions, while using its entropy as an input in a 
      decision tree classifier. We collected the ECG signal from 25 healthy participants 
      while they were presented with videos eliciting negative (fear and disgust) and 
      neutral emotions. The results indicated that the neutral condition showed a perfect 
      identification (100%), whereas the classification of negative emotions indicated 
      good identification performances (60% of sensitivity and 80% of specificity). These 
      results suggest that the entropy of noise contains relevant information that can be 
      useful to improve the analysis of the physiological correlates of emotion.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac 
      arrhythmia in clinical practice, having been recognized as a true cardiovascular 
      epidemic. In this paper, a new methodology for Computer Aided Diagnosis of AF based 
      on a special kind of artificial adaptive systems has been developed. METHODS: 
      Following the extraction of data from the PhysioNet repository, a new dataset 
      composed of the R/R distances of 73 patients was created. To avoid redundancy, the 
      training set was created by randomly selecting 50% of the subjects from the entire 
      sample, thus making a choice by patient and not by record. The remaining 50% of 
      subjects were randomly split by records in testing and prediction sets. The original 
      ECG data has been transformed according to the following four orders of abstraction: 
      a) sequence of R/R intervals; b) composition of ECG data into a moving window; c) 
      training of different machine learning systems to abstract the function governing 
      the AF; d) fuzzy transformation of Machine learning estimations. In this paper, in 
      parallel with the classic method of windowing, we propose a variant based on a 
      system of progressive moving averages. RESULTS: The best performing machine 
      learning, Supervised Contractive Map (SVCm), reached an overall mean accuracy of 
      95%. SVCm is a new deep neural network based on a different principle than the usual 
      descending gradient. The minimization of the error occurs by means of decomposition 
      into contracted sine functions. CONCLUSIONS: In this research, atrial fibrillation 
      is considered from a completely different point of view than classical methods. It 
      is seen as the stable process, i.e. the function, that manages the irregularity of 
      the irregularities of the R/R intervals. The idea, therefore, is to abstract from 
      mere physiology to investigate fibrillation as a mathematical object that handles 
      irregularities. The attained results seem to open new perspectives for the use of 
      potent artificial adaptive systems for the automatic detection of atrial 
      fibrillation, with accuracy rates extremely promising for real world applications.

TI  - Signs of vagal reinnervation 4 years after heart transplantation in spectra of heart 
      rate variability.
PG  - 907-12
AB  - Several investigators have shown signs of possible sympathetic but not 
      parasympathetic reinnervation in heart transplanted patients. Spectral analysis of 
      heart rate and blood pressure variability is a noninvasive tool appropriate to 
      detect a functional autonomous reinnervation to the heart. In a follow-up study, 13 
      patients after heart transplantation (HTx) were investigated, mean age 50.6+/-8.5 
      years, 18 healthy volunteers were selected as control group. For each patient two 
      recordings were performed which took part 14+/-5 months respectively 42+/-8 months 
      after HTx. ECG and systolic blood pressure (SBP) have been recorded simultaneously 
      for 5 min in supine position during controlled respiratory rate of 12 or 15 
      cycles/min. No graft rejection has been detected in the endomyocardial biopsy 
      performed right after the recordings. Power spectral densities (PSD) were calculated 
      for the beat-to-beat time series of RR-intervals (distance of two following QRS 
      complexes) and SBPs. The area of PSD in the range of 0.05-0.17 Hz was defined as low 
      frequency (LF) and that of 0.18-0.35 Hz as high frequency (HF). LF and HF are 
      indicative of efferent sympathetic respectively parasympathetic activity at the 
      sinus node. A significant increase of LF (226%) and HF (213%) during a mean period 
      of 28 months could be found. No differences were to be shown for systolic blood 
      pressure variability. Previous findings confirm that LF band increases 4 years after 
      transplantation, suggesting a possible sympathetic reinnervation of the heart. On 
      the other hand an increase of the HF band also suggests a parasympathetic 
      reinnervation.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate the association of 4 left bundle branch 
      block (LBBB) definitions and their individual ECG characteristics with clinical 
      outcome. Furthermore, it aimed to combine relevant outcome-associated 
      electrocardiographic (ECG) characteristics into a novel outcome-based definition. 
      BACKGROUND: LBBB morphology is associated with positive response to cardiac 
      resynchronization therapy. However, there are multiple LBBB definitions. 
      Associations with outcomes may differ between definitions and depend on varying 
      contributions of the individual ECG characteristics that these LBBB definitions are 
      composed of. METHODS: A retrospective multicenter study was conducted in 1,492 
      cardiac resynchronization therapy patients. Patients were classified as LBBB or 
      non-LBBB according to definitions provided by the European Society of Cardiology, 
      American Heart Association, MADIT-CRT (Multicenter Automatic Defibrillator 
      Implantation with Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy) trial, and according to Strauss 
      et al., the primary endpoint was left ventricular assist device implantation, 
      cardiac transplantation, and all-cause mortality. RESULTS: LBBB classification 
      differed significantly between the 4 definitions (kappa coefficients ranging from 
      0.09 to 0.92). The American Heart Association definition correlated the least (0.09 
      to 0.12) with the other definitions. Only 13.8% of patients were classified as LBBB 
      by all definitions. During a follow-up period of 3.4 ± 2.4 years, 472 (32%) patients 
      experienced the primary endpoint. For each LBBB definition survival analysis showed 
      a significant association of LBBB with outcome, with relative risk reduction ranging 
      from 39% to 43%. Each LBBB definition included characteristics that were not 
      associated with outcome. Combining outcome-associated ECG characteristics into a 
      novel prediction model did not significantly improve diagnostic performance 
      (relative risk reduction 43%). CONCLUSIONS: The classification of LBBB is highly 
      dependent on the LBBB definition used. However, each LBBB definition provides a 
      comparable difference in risk of adverse clinical events between LBBB and non-LBBB 
      patients. Combining individual outcome-associated ECG-characteristics into a novel 
      prediction model does not improve association with outcome.

AB  - Recent advances in sensor and recording technology have allowed scientists to 
      acquire very large time-series datasets. Researchers often analyze these datasets in 
      the context of events, which are intervals of time where the properties of the 
      signal change relative to a baseline signal. We have developed DETECT, a MATLAB 
      toolbox for detecting event time intervals in long, multi-channel time series. Our 
      primary goal is to produce a toolbox that is simple for researchers to use, allowing 
      them to quickly train a model on multiple classes of events, assess the accuracy of 
      the model, and determine how closely the results agree with their own manual 
      identification of events without requiring extensive programming knowledge or 
      machine learning experience. As an illustration, we discuss application of the 
      DETECT toolbox for detecting signal artifacts found in continuous multi-channel EEG 
      recordings and show the functionality of the tools found in the toolbox. We also 
      discuss the application of DETECT for identifying irregular heartbeat waveforms 
      found in electrocardiogram (ECG) data as an additional illustration.

AB  - Fitness level, fatigue and adaptation are important factors for determining the 
      optimal training schedule and predicting future performance. We think that adding 
      analysis of the mutual relationships between cardiac and respiratory activity 
      enables better athlete profiling and feedback for improving training. Therefore, the 
      main objectives were (1) to apply several methods for temporal causality analysis to 
      cardiorespiratory data; (2) to establish causal links between the signals; and (3) 
      to determine how parameterized connections differed across various subgroups. One 
      hundred elite athletes (31 female) and a control group of 20 healthy students (6 
      female) took part in the study. All were asked to follow a protocol comprising two 
      5-min sessions of free breathing - once supine, once standing. The data were 
      collected using Pneumonitor 2. Respiratory-related curves were obtained through 
      impedance pneumography, along with a single-lead ECG. Several signals (e.g., tidal 
      volume, instantaneous respiratory rate, and instantaneous heart rate) were derived 
      and stored as: (1) raw data down-sampled to 25Hz; (2) further down-sampled to 2.5Hz; 
      and (3) beat-by-beat sequences. Granger causality frameworks (pairwise-conditional, 
      spectral or extended), along with Time Series Models with Independent Noise 
      (TiMINo), were studied. The connections enabling the best distinctions were found 
      using recursive feature elimination with a random forest kernel. Temporal causal 
      links are the most evident between tidal volume and instantaneous heart rate 
      signals. Predictions of the "effect" variable were improved by adding preceding 
      "cause" samples, by medians of 20.3% for supine and 14.2% for standing body 
      positions. Parameterized causal link structures and directions distinguish athletes 
      from non-athletes with 83.3% accuracy on average. They may also be used to 
      supplement standard analysis and enable classification into groups exhibiting 
      different static and dynamic components during performance. Physiological markers of 
      training may be extended to include cardiorespiratory data, and causality analysis 
      may improve the resolution of training profiling and the precision of outcome 
      prediction.

LID - e0184352
AB  - BACKGROUND: To evaluate QT-interval dynamics in patients and in drug safety 
      analysis, beat-to-beat QT-interval measurements are increasingly used. However, 
      interobserver differences, aberrant T-wave morphologies and changes in heart axis 
      might hamper accurate QT-interval measurements. OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate a 
      QT-interval algorithm robust to heart axis orientation and T-wave morphology that 
      can be applied on a beat-to-beat basis. METHODS: Additionally to standard ECG leads, 
      the root mean square (ECGRMS), standard deviation and vectorcardiogram were used. 
      QRS-onset was defined from the ECGRMS. T-wave end was defined per individual lead 
      and scalar ECG using an automated tangent method. A median of all T-wave ends was 
      used as the general T-wave end per beat. Supine-standing tests of 73 patients with 
      Long-QT syndrome (LQTS) and 54 controls were used because they have wide ranges of 
      RR and QT-intervals as well as changes in T-wave morphology and heart axis 
      orientation. For each subject, automatically estimated QT-intervals in three random 
      complexes chosen from the low, middle and high RR range, were compared with manually 
      measured QT-intervals by three observers. RESULTS: After visual inspection of the 
      randomly selected complexes, 21 complexes were excluded because of evident noise, 
      too flat T-waves or premature ventricular beats. Bland-Altman analyses of 
      automatically and manually determined QT-intervals showed a bias of <4ms and limits 
      of agreement of ±25ms. Intra-class coefficient indicated excellent agreement (>0.9) 
      between the algorithm and all observers individually as well as between the 
      algorithm and the mean QT-interval of the observers. CONCLUSION: Our automated 
      algorithm provides reliable beat-to-beat QT-interval assessment, robust to heart 
      axis and T-wave morphology.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The automatic interpretation of electrocardiography (ECG) data can 
      provide continuous analysis of heart activity, allowing the effective use of 
      wireless devices such as the Holter monitor. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We propose an 
      intelligent heartbeat monitoring system to detect the possibility of arrhythmia in 
      real time. We detected heartbeats and extracted features such as the QRS complex and 
      P wave from ECG signals using the Pan-Tompkins algorithm, and the heartbeats were 
      then classified into 16 types using a decision tree. RESULTS: We tested the 
      sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of our system against data from the MIT-BIH 
      Arrhythmia Database. Our system achieved an average accuracy of 97% in heartbeat 
      detection and an average heartbeat classification accuracy of above 96%, which is 
      comparable with the best competing schemes. CONCLUSIONS: This work provides a guide 
      to the systematic design of an intelligent classification system for decision 
      support in Holter ECG monitoring.

TI  - Anaphylactic shock during cement implantation of a total hip arthroplasty in a 
      patient with underlying mastocytosis: case report of a rare intraoperative 
      complication.
PG  - 25
LID - 25
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cemented total hip arthroplasty (THA) is a safe and common procedure. In 
      rare cases life threatening bone cement implantation syndrome (BCIS) may occur, 
      which is commonly caused by pulmonary embolism (PE). CASE PRESENTATION: We describe 
      the rare case of a 70-year old patient who underwent an elective total hip 
      replacement. Before surgery he was diagnosed with underlying systemic indolent 
      mastocytosis, a rare pathological disorder that may result in anaphylaxis after 
      massive systemic mast cell activation. Triggers may be IgE-mediated, direct mast 
      cell activation, or unclear. Some patients may be at risk for severe non 
      IgE-mediated reactions, such as those experienced with nonsteroidal 
      anti-inflammatory drugs, or with perioperative muscle relaxants. During cementing of 
      the acetabular component, our patient developed acute hypotension (blood pressure 
      dropped from 90/50 to 60/40 mmHg, and saturation dropped from 95 to 80 %). The 
      differential diagnosis of acute PE was excluded (no signs of breathing abnormalities 
      during physical examination, normal arterial blood sample, and no 
      electrocardiography or cardiac ultrasound abnormalities). The patient was diagnosed 
      with acute anaphylactic shock, which was successfully managed by 100 % oxygen 
      administration, rapid fluid induction, and vasoconstrictive drug therapy. He 
      recovered hemodynamically within 15 min, did not lose consciousness, and did not 
      develop angioedema or an urticarial rash. Forty-five minutes after onset of the 
      symptoms, the surgical procedure was completed after inserting a press fitted 
      uncemented femoral stem component. The patient was transported to the Intensive Care 
      Unit (ICU) for optimal monitoring. Our patient had an uneventful recovery. Within 
      six hours after surgery he started to ambulate following our standard fast-track 
      rehabilitation regime. Post-operative day one he was discharged to the specialized 
      Orthopedic Department, and after five hospital days discharged to his home. Twelve 
      months after THA surgery our patient was satisfied with an optimal functional status 
      of his hip joint replacement. CONCLUSION: The differential diagnosis of anaphylactic 
      shock must be taken into consideration in patients with acute hypotension during 
      cementing of total hip arthroplasty components. Patients with underlying 
      mastocytosis are at particular risk of this potential life-threatening 
      intra-operative complication. This rare entity should be taken into consideration 
      during the pre-operative risk stratification and shared decision-making process for 
      elective cemented joint replacement.

AB  - J wave is the bulge generated in the descending slope of the terminal portion of the 
      QRS complex in the electrocardiogram. The presence of J wave may lead to sudden 
      death. However, the diagnosis of J wave variation only depends on doctor's clinical 
      experiences at present and missed diagnosis is easy to occur. In this paper, a new 
      method is proposed to realize the automatic detection of J wave. First, the 
      synchrosqueezed wavelet transform is used to obtain the precise time-frequency 
      information of the ECG. Then, the inverse transformation of SST is computed to get 
      the intrinsic mode function of the ECG. At last, the time-frequency features and 
      SST-based and the entropy features based on modes are fed to Random forest to 
      realize the automatic detection of J wave. As the experimental results shown, the 
      proposed method has achieved the highest accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity 
      compared with existing techniques.

      Semi-Markov Models.
PG  - 165-8
LID - 10.1109/IEMBS.2008.4649116 [doi]
AB  - This paper presents a new method to analyse cardiac electrophysiological dynamics. 
      It aims to classify or to cluster (i.e. to find natural groups) patients according 
      to the dynamics of features extracted from their ECG. In this work, the dynamics of 
      the features are modelled with Continuous Density Hidden Semi-Markovian Models 
      (CDHSMM) which are interesting for the characterization of continuous multivariate 
      time series without a priori information. These models can be easily used for 
      classification and clustering. In this last case, a specific method, based on a 
      fuzzy Expectation Maximisation (EM) algorithm, is proposed. Both tasks are applied 
      to the analysis of ischemic episodes with encouraging results and a classification 
      accuracy of 71%.

      population.
PG  - 63-73
LID - 10.1080/07853890.2020.1731759 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: Partial and advanced interatrial block (IAB) in the 
      electrocardiographic (ECG) represents inter-atrial conduction delay. IAB is 
      associated with atrial fibrillation (AF) and stroke in the general 
      population.Material and methods: A representative sample of Finnish subjects 
      (n = 6354) aged over 30 years (mean: 52.2 years, standard deviation: 14.6) underwent 
      a health examination including a 12-lead ECG. Five different IAB groups based on 
      automatic measurements were compared to normal P waves using multivariate-adjusted 
      Cox proportional hazard model. Follow-up lasted up to 15 years.Results: The 
      prevalence of advanced and partial IAB was 1.0% and 9.7%, respectively. In the 
      multivariate model, both advanced (hazard ratio (HR): 1.63 (95% confidence interval 
      (CI): 1.00-2.65)) and partial IAB (HR: 1.39 (1.09-1.77)) were associated with 
      increased risk of AF. Advanced IAB was associated with increased risk of stroke or 
      transient ischaemic attack (TIA) independently of associated AF (HR: 2.22 
      (1.20-4.13)). Partial IAB was also associated with increased risk of being diagnosed 
      with coronary heart disease (HR: 1.26 (1.01-1.58)).Discussion: IAB is a rather 
      frequent finding in the general population. IAB is a risk factor for AF and is 
      associated with an increased risk of stroke or TIA independently of associated 
      AF.Key messagesBoth partial and advanced interatrial block are associated with 
      increased risk of atrial fibrillation in the general population.Advanced interatrial 
      block is an independent risk factor for stroke and transient ischaemic attack.The 
      clinical significance of interatrial block is dependent on the subtype 
      classification.

AB  - CLINICAL INTRODUCTION: A man in his early 30s with remote history of a febrile rash 
      as a toddler presented to the emergency room following an out-of-hospital cardiac 
      arrest while riding his bicycle. He received bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation 
      and one shock from an automatic external defibrillator, successfully restoring sinus 
      rhythm. On arrival, he was haemodynamically stable without ECG evidence of ST 
      segment changes to suggest active ischaemia, and an initial troponin I was mildly 
      elevated at 0.10 ng/mL (normal <0.04 ng/mL). A CT angiogram (CTA) was obtained 
      showing a normal-appearing aorta and no abnormal extracardiac findings. Urgent 
      coronary angiography was performed; images are shown in figure 1A-C. Echocardiogram 
      revealed a mildly reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (45%) with a 
      hypokinetic inferior wall.heartjnl;104/21/1771/F1F1F1Figure 1(A) Right coronary

TI  - Observations on respiratory and cardiovascular rhythmicities during yogic 
      high-frequency respiration.
PG  - 345-54
AB  - Yogic high-frequency respiration--kapalabhati (KB)--was studied in 24 subjects from 
      a point of rhythmicity. Respiratory movements, blood pressure and R-R intervals of 
      ECG were recorded in parallel and evaluated by spectral analysis of time series. 
      Respiratory signals during KB were modulated by 0.1 Hz rhythm in 82% of experiments. 
      This component was also present in R-R intervals and blood pressure during KB. 
      Frequency (0.2-0.3 Hz) was observed in 67% of respiratory records. The presence of 
      the component 0.2-0.3 Hz in respiration was dependent on resting respiratory 
      frequency. This frequency component was reduced in R-R intervals but increased in 
      blood pressure during kapalabhati as compared to that at rest. The occurrence of 
      both frequency components in respiration during KB supports the hypothesis about the 
      integrative role of cardiovascular and respiratory rhythms in physiological states 
      characterized by altered respiratory frequency.

TI  - Automatic Detection of General Anesthetic-States using ECG-Derived Autonomic Nervous 
      System Features.
PG  - 2019-2022
LID - 10.1109/EMBC.2019.8857704 [doi]
AB  - Electroencephalogram (EEG)-based prediction systems are used to target 
      anesthetic-states in patients undergoing procedures with general anesthesia (GA). 
      These systems are not widely employed in resource-limited settings because they are 
      cost-prohibitive. Although anesthetic-drugs induce highly-structured, oscillatory 
      neural dynamics that make EEG-based systems a principled approach for 
      anesthetic-state monitoring, anesthetic-drugs also significantly modulate the 
      autonomic nervous system (ANS). Because ANS dynamics can be inferred from 
      electrocardiogram (ECG) features such as heart rate variability, it may be possible 
      to develop an ECG-based system to infer anesthetic-states as a low-cost and 
      practical alternative to EEG-based anesthetic-state prediction systems. In this 
      work, we demonstrate that an ECG-based system using ANS features can be used to 
      discriminate between non-GA and GA states in sevoflurane, with a GA F(1) score of 
      0.834, [95% CI, 0.776, 0.892], and in sevoflurane-plus-ketamine, with a GA F(1) 
      score of 0.880 [0.815, 0.954]. With further refinement, ECG-based anesthetic-state 
      systems could be developed as a fully automated system for anesthetic-state 
      monitoring in resource-limited settings.

AB  - Feature test-retest reliability is proposed as a useful criterion for the 
      selection/exclusion of features in time series classification tasks. Three sets of 
      physiological time series are examined, EEG and ECG recordings together with 
      measurements of neck movement. Comparisons of reliability estimates from test-retest 
      studies with measures of feature importance from classification tasks suggest that 
      low reliability can be used to exclude irrelevant features prior to classifier 
      training. By removing features with low reliability an unnecessary degradation of 
      the classifier accuracy may be avoided.

TI  - High-resolution esophageal long-term ECG allows detailed atrial wave morphology 
      analysis in case of atrial ectopic beats.
PG  - 769-72
LID - 10.1007/s11517-012-0915-7 [doi]
AB  - Detection of arrhythmic atrial beats in surface ECGs can be challenging when they 
      are masked by the R or T wave, or do not affect the RR-interval. Here, we present a 
      solution using a high-resolution esophageal long-term ECG that offers a detailed 
      view on the atrial electrical activity. The recorded ECG shows atrial ectopic beats 
      with long coupling intervals, which can only be successfully classified using 
      additional morphology criteria. Esophageal high-resolution ECGs provide this 
      information, whereas surface long-term ECGs show poor atrial signal quality. This 
      new method is a promising tool for the long-term rhythm monitoring with 
      software-based automatic classification of atrial beats.

TI  - Maximum QTc on Holter electrocardiography in children.
PG  - 507-512
LID - 10.1111/ped.13556 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Corrected QT interval (QTc) on electrocardiography (ECG) at rest and 
      after exercise in a short daytime recording period may be insufficient for the 
      diagnosis and management of long QT syndrome (LQTS), especially for LQTS type 2 and 
      3. Therefore, examination of QTc on Holter ECG is important. We designed a method of 
      analyzing QTc on Holter ECG that can be performed in daily clinical practice by 
      combining automatic and manual measurements. METHODS: We reviewed the charts of 
      healthy children (n = 210) and LQTS patients (n = 35) aged <16 years and analyzed 
      QTc at rest and after exercise, and the maximum QTc on Holter ECG. RESULTS: The QTc 
      (Fridericia's correction) of most controls and LQTS patients reached the maximum at 
      night or early in the morning. QTc differed according to sex and age. In the control 
      group, QTc on ECG of all three types tended to lengthen with age. QTc after exercise 
      was slightly longer than QTc at rest, and the maximum QTc on Holter ECG was much 
      longer than both, reaching >450 ms in boys and 500 ms in girls. In most LQTS type 1 
      patients, QTc after exercise and that on Holter ECG tended to be long. In most LQTS 
      type 2 and 3 patients, QTc at rest and that after exercise was long, and that on 
      Holter ECG tended to be much longer. CONCLUSIONS: The present method of analyzing 
      QTc on Holter ECG, in which automatic and manual measurements are combined, is 
      practical and may be useful for diagnosis and risk stratification of LQTS.

TI  - Heart rate variability in athletes.
PG  - 889-919
AB  - This review examines the influence on heart rate variability (HRV) indices in 
      athletes from training status, different types of exercise training, sex and ageing, 
      presented from both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. The predictability of 
      HRV in over-training, athletic condition and athletic performance is also included. 
      Finally, some recommendations concerning the application of HRV methods in athletes 
      are made.The cardiovascular system is mostly controlled by autonomic regulation 
      through the activity of sympathetic and parasympathetic pathways of the autonomic 
      nervous system. Analysis of HRV permits insight in this control mechanism. It can 
      easily be determined from ECG recordings, resulting in time series (RR-intervals) 
      that are usually analysed in time and frequency domains. As a first approach, it can 
      be assumed that power in different frequency bands corresponds to activity of 
      sympathetic (0.04-0.15 Hz) and parasympathetic (0.15-0.4 Hz) nerves. However, other 
      mechanisms (and feedback loops) are also at work, especially in the low frequency 
      band. During dynamic exercise, it is generally assumed that heart rate increases due 
      to both a parasympathetic withdrawal and an augmented sympathetic activity. However, 
      because some authors disagree with the former statement and the fact that during 
      exercise there is also a technical problem related to the non-stationary signals, a 
      critical look at interpretation of results is needed. It is strongly suggested that, 
      when presenting reports on HRV studies related to exercise physiology in general or 
      concerned with athletes, a detailed description should be provided on analysis 
      methods, as well as concerning population, and training schedule, intensity and 
      duration. Most studies concern relatively small numbers of study participants, 
      diminishing the power of statistics. Therefore, multicentre studies would be 
      preferable. In order to further develop this fascinating research field, we advocate 
      prospective, randomised, controlled, long-term studies using validated measurement 
      methods. Finally, there is a strong need for basic research on the nature of the 
      control and regulating mechanism exerted by the autonomic nervous system on 
      cardiovascular function in athletes, preferably with a multidisciplinary approach 
      between cardiologists, exercise physiologists, pulmonary physiologists, coaches and 
      biomedical engineers.

TI  - Signatures of Subacute Potentially Catastrophic Illness in the ICU: Model 
      Development and Validation.
PG  - 1639-48
LID - 10.1097/CCM.0000000000001738 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Patients in ICUs are susceptible to subacute potentially catastrophic 
      illnesses such as respiratory failure, sepsis, and hemorrhage that present as severe 
      derangements of vital signs. More subtle physiologic signatures may be present 
      before clinical deterioration, when treatment might be more effective. We performed 
      multivariate statistical analyses of bedside physiologic monitoring data to identify 
      such early subclinical signatures of incipient life-threatening illness. DESIGN: We 
      report a study of model development and validation of a retrospective observational 
      cohort using resampling (Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model 
      for Individual Prognosis Or Diagnosis type 1b internal validation) and a study of 
      model validation using separate data (type 2b internal/external validation). 
      SETTING: University of Virginia Health System (Charlottesville), a tertiary-care, 
      academic medical center. PATIENTS: Critically ill patients consecutively admitted 
      between January 2009 and June 2015 to either the neonatal, surgical/trauma/burn, or 
      medical ICUs with available physiologic monitoring data. INTERVENTIONS: None. 
      MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We analyzed 146 patient-years of vital sign and 
      electrocardiography waveform time series from the bedside monitors of 9,232 ICU 
      admissions. Calculations from 30-minute windows of the physiologic monitoring data 
      were made every 15 minutes. Clinicians identified 1,206 episodes of respiratory 
      failure leading to urgent unplanned intubation, sepsis, or hemorrhage leading to 
      multi-unit transfusions from systematic individual chart reviews. Multivariate 
      models to predict events up to 24 hours prior had internally validated C-statistics 
      of 0.61-0.88. In adults, physiologic signatures of respiratory failure and 
      hemorrhage were distinct from each other but externally consistent across ICUs. 
      Sepsis, on the other hand, demonstrated less distinct and inconsistent signatures. 
      Physiologic signatures of all neonatal illnesses were similar. CONCLUSIONS: Subacute 
      potentially catastrophic illnesses in three diverse ICU populations have physiologic 
      signatures that are detectable in the hours preceding clinical detection and 
      intervention. Detection of such signatures can draw attention to patients at highest 
      risk, potentially enabling earlier intervention and better outcomes.

TI  - ECG delineation using a piecewise Gaussian derivative model with parameters 
      estimated from scale-dependent algebraic expressions.
PG  - 5633-5637
LID - 10.1109/EMBC.2019.8856523 [doi]
AB  - Automatic methods for the detection of characteristic points in electrocardiography 
      signals support cardiologists in assessing the state of a patient's cardiovascular 
      system. In this work, we apply a general method for parameter estimation to the 
      specific problem of QRS complex, P-, and T-wave delineation, i.e. the computation of 
      their on- and offset points in time. As input the method expects a piecewise 
      Gaussian derivative model that is potentially a good fit for the morphology of 
      electrocardiography waves, but a thorough investigation is needed. The model 
      parameters are estimated by substituting zero-crossings of the input signals' 
      scale-space representation into scale-dependent algebraic expressions and are 
      further refined by fitting the model to the electrocardiography signal in a 
      least-squares sense. Validating the results on the QT database and comparing to 
      state-of-the-art algorithms shows smallest mean error for 3 out of 9 fiducial points 
      and for the others only small differences to the respective best competitors.

TI  - Bimodal classification algorithm for atrial fibrillation detection from m-health ECG

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Atrial Fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia, 
      presenting a significant independent risk factor for stroke and thromboembolism. 
      With the emergence of m-Health devices, the importance of automatic detection of AF 
      in an off-clinic setting is growing. This study demonstrates the performance of a 
      bimodal classifier for distinguishing AF from sinus rhythm (SR) that could be used 
      for automated detection of AF episodes. METHODS: Surface recordings from a hand-held 
      research device and standard electrocardiograms (ECG) were collected and analyzed 
      from 68 subjects. An additional 48 subjects from the MIT-BIH Arrythmia Database were 
      also analyzed. All ECGs were blindly reviewed by physicians independently of the 
      bimodal algorithm analysis. The algorithm selects an artifact-free 6-s ECG segment 
      out of a 20-s long recording and computes a spectral Frequency Dispersion Metric 
      (FDM) and a temporal R-R interval variability (VRR) index. RESULTS: Scatter plots of 
      the VRR and FDM indices revealed two distinct clusters. The bimodal scattering of 
      the indices revealed a linear classification boundary that could be employed to 
      differentiate the SR from AF waveforms. The selected classification boundary was 
      able to correctly differentiate all the subjects from both datasets into either SR 
      or AF groups, except for 3 SR subjects from the MIT-BIH dataset. CONCLUSION: Our 
      bimodal classification algorithm was demonstrated to successfully acquire, analyze 
      and interpret ECGs for the presence of AF indicating its potential to support 
      m-Health diagnosis, monitoring, and management of therapy in AF patients.

TI  - Measuring cardiac autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity in children.
PG  - e50073
LID - 10.3791/50073 [doi]
LID - 50073
AB  - The autonomic nervous system (ANS) controls mainly automatic bodily functions that 
      are engaged in homeostasis, like heart rate, digestion, respiratory rate, 
      salivation, perspiration and renal function. The ANS has two main branches: the 
      sympathetic nervous system, preparing the human body for action in times of danger 
      and stress, and the parasympathetic nervous system, which regulates the resting 
      state of the body. ANS activity can be measured invasively, for instance by 
      radiotracer techniques or microelectrode recording from superficial nerves, or it 
      can be measured non-invasively by using changes in an organ's response as a proxy 
      for changes in ANS activity, for instance of the sweat glands or the heart. Invasive 
      measurements have the highest validity but are very poorly feasible in large scale 
      samples where non-invasive measures are the preferred approach. Autonomic effects on 
      the heart can be reliably quantified by the recording of the electrocardiogram (ECG) 
      in combination with the impedance cardiogram (ICG), which reflects the changes in 
      thorax impedance in response to respiration and the ejection of blood from the 
      ventricle into the aorta. From the respiration and ECG signals, respiratory sinus 
      arrhythmia can be extracted as a measure of cardiac parasympathetic control. From 
      the ECG and the left ventricular ejection signals, the preejection period can be 
      extracted as a measure of cardiac sympathetic control. ECG and ICG recording is 
      mostly done in laboratory settings. However, having the subjects report to a 
      laboratory greatly reduces ecological validity, is not always doable in large scale 
      epidemiological studies, and can be intimidating for young children. An ambulatory 
      device for ECG and ICG simultaneously resolves these three problems. Here, we 
      present a study design for a minimally invasive and rapid assessment of cardiac 
      autonomic control in children, using a validated ambulatory device (1-5), the VU 
      University Ambulatory Monitoring System (VU-AMS, Amsterdam, the Netherlands, 
      www.vu-ams.nl).

TI  - Automatic classification of heartbeats using wavelet neural network.
PG  - 883-92
LID - 10.1007/s10916-010-9551-7 [doi]
AB  - The electrocardiogram (ECG) signal is widely employed as one of the most important 
      tools in clinical practice in order to assess the cardiac status of patients. The 
      classification of the ECG into different pathologic disease categories is a complex 
      pattern recognition task. In this paper, we propose a method for ECG heartbeat 
      pattern recognition using wavelet neural network (WNN). To achieve this objective, 
      an algorithm for QRS detection is first implemented, then a WNN Classifier is 
      developed. The experimental results obtained by testing the proposed approach on ECG 
      data from the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database demonstrate the efficiency of such an 
      approach when compared with other methods existing in the literature.

AB  - The high rate of false alarms in intensive care units (ICUs) is one of the top 
      challenges of using medical technology in hospitals. These false alarms are often 
      caused by patients' movements, detachment of monitoring sensors, or different 
      sources of noise and interference that impact the collected signals from different 
      monitoring devices. In this paper, we propose a novel set of high-level features 
      based on unsupervised feature learning technique in order to effectively capture the 
      characteristics of different arrhythmia in electrocardiogram (ECG) signal and 
      differentiate them from irregularity in signals due to different sources of signal 
      disturbances. This unsupervised feature learning technique, first extracts a set of 
      low-level features from all existing heart cycles of a patient, and then clusters 
      these segments for each individual patient to provide a set of prominent high-level 
      features. The objective of the clustering phase is to enable the classification 
      method to differentiate between the high-level features extracted from normal and 
      abnormal cycles (i.e., either due to arrhythmia or different sources of distortions 
      in signal) in order to put more attention to the features extracted from abnormal 
      portion of the signal that contribute to the alarm.

TI  - Evaluation of a Multichannel Non-Contact ECG System and Signal Quality Algorithms 
      for Sleep Apnea Detection and Monitoring.

LID - 577
AB  - Sleep-related conditions require high-cost and low-comfort diagnosis at the hospital 
      during one night or longer. To overcome this situation, this work aims to evaluate 
      an unobtrusive monitoring technique for sleep apnea. This paper presents, for the 
      first time, the evaluation of contactless capacitively-coupled electrocardiography 
      (ccECG) signals for the extraction of sleep apnea features, together with a 
      comparison of different signal quality indicators. A multichannel ccECG system is 
      used to collect signals from 15 subjects in a sleep environment from different 
      positions. Reference quality labels were assigned for every 30-s segment. Quality 
      indicators were calculated, and their signal classification performance was 
      evaluated. Features for the detection of sleep apnea were extracted from capacitive 
      and reference signals. Sleep apnea features related to heart rate and heart rate 
      variability achieved high similarity to the reference values, with p-values of 0.94 
      and 0.98, which is in line with the more than 95% beat-matching obtained. Features 
      related to signal morphology presented lower similarity with the reference, although 
      signal similarity metrics of correlation and coherence were relatively high. 
      Quality-based automatic classification of the signals had a maximum accuracy of 91%. 
      Best-performing quality indicators were based on template correlation and 
      beat-detection. Results suggest that using unobtrusive cardiac signals for the 
      automatic detection of sleep apnea can achieve similar performance as contact 
      signals, and indicates clinical value of ccECG. Moreover, signal segments can 
      automatically be classified by the proposed quality metrics as a pre-processing 
      step. Including contactless respiration signals is likely to improve the performance 
      and provide a complete unobtrusive cardiorespiratory monitoring solution; this is a 
      promising alternative that will allow the screening of more patients with higher 
      comfort, for a longer time, and at a reduced cost.

TI  - Design and Evaluation of a Wireless Electrocardiogram Monitor in an Operating Room: 
      A Pilot Study.
PG  - 991-996
LID - 10.1213/ANE.0000000000003972 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Wired electrocardiogram monitors are an important component of current 
      perioperative monitoring. Wireless monitoring units could help reduce the number of 
      cables attached to patients and thus improve anesthesia ergonomics and patient 
      management. However, there is concern that electromagnetic interference generated by 
      electrosurgical units may prevent effective wireless signals in the operating room. 
      To evaluate the extent of this problem, we developed a Bluetooth electrocardiogram 
      prototype monitor and compared its electrocardiogram traces to those captured with a 
      standard wired electrocardiogram monitor in our operating room. METHODS: Bluetooth 
      electrocardiogram and standard electrocardiogram traces captured from 10 patients 
      undergoing surgical procedures that required use of an electrosurgical unit were 
      compared by analysis of the durations of the P wave, QRS complex, and T wave and the 
      position of the ST segment from the isoelectric line. The impact of the 
      electrosurgical units on the Bluetooth electrocardiogram and S-electrocardiogram 
      recordings was also assessed. RESULTS: There were no clinically relevant differences 
      in P wave, QRS complex, or T-wave durations (0.006, 0.004, and 0.017 seconds, 
      respectively) between Bluetooth electrocardiogram and standard electrocardiogram or 
      in the position of the ST segment from the isoelectric line (0.02 mV). Mean 
      differences were near zero, and Bland-Altman limits of agreement for individual 
      differences were narrow (-0.035 to 0.047, -0.03 to 0.038, and -0.112 to 0.078 
      seconds for P wave, QRS complex, and T-wave durations, respectively, and -0.13 to 
      0.17 mV for ST segment position). Electrosurgical units use electrically disrupted 
      Bluetooth electrocardiogram and standard electrocardiogram signals, but there was no 
      electromagnetic interference effect on the Bluetooth electrocardiogram signals. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Wireless electrocardiogram using Bluetooth can be reliably used in the 
      operating room. The electrosurgical unit induces electric rather than 
      electromagnetic artifacts, thus affecting wired and wireless electrocardiogram in a 
      similar fashion.

LID - 10.1063/1.4941374 [doi]
AB  - Reconstruction of phase space is an effective method to quantify the dynamics of a 
      signal or a time series. Various phase space reconstruction techniques have been 
      investigated. However, there are some issues on the optimal reconstructions and the 
      best possible choice of the reconstruction parameters. This research introduces the 
      idea of gradient cross recurrence (GCR) and mean gradient cross recurrence density 
      which shows that reconstructions in time frequency domain preserve more information 
      about the dynamics than the optimal reconstructions in time domain. This analysis is 
      further extended to ECG signals of normal and congestive heart failure patients. By 
      using another newly introduced measure-gradient cross recurrence period density 
      entropy, two classes of aforesaid ECG signals can be classified with a proper 
      threshold. This analysis can be applied to quantifying and distinguishing biomedical 
      and other nonlinear signals.

TI  - Automatic screening method for atrial fibrillation based on lossy compression of the 
      electrocardiogram signal.
LID - 10.1088/1361-6579/ab979f [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Compressed sensing is a low-complexity compression technology that has 
      recently been proposed. It can be applied to long-term electrocardiogram (ECG) 
      monitoring using wearable devices. In this study, an automatic screening method for 
      atrial fibrillation based on lossy compression of the electrocardiogram signal is 
      proposed. APPROACH: The proposed method combines the compressed sensing with the 
      convolutional neural network. The sparse binary sensing matrix is first used to 
      project the raw ECG signal randomly, transformed the raw ECG data from 
      high-dimensional space to low-dimensional space to complete compression, and then 
      uses CNN to classify the compressed ECG signal involving AF. Our proposed model is 
      validated on the MIT-BIH Atrial Fibrillation Database. MAIN RESULTS: The 
      experimental results show that the model only needs about 1s to complete the 24-hour 
      ECG recording of AF, which is 3.41%, 69.84% and 67.56% less than the time required 
      by AlexNet, VGGNet and GoogLeNet. Under different compression ratios of 10% to 90%, 
      the maximum and minimum F1 scores reach 96.25% and 88.17%, respectively. 
      SIGNIFICANCE: The CS-CNN model has high computational efficiency while ensuring 
      prediction accuracy, and is a promising method for AF screening in wearable 
      application scenarios.

TI  - A Generative Modeling Approach to Limited Channel ECG Classification.
PG  - 2571-2574
LID - 10.1109/EMBC.2018.8512757 [doi]
AB  - Processing temporal sequences is central to a variety of applications in health 
      care, and in particular multichannel Electrocardiogram (ECG) is a highly prevalent 
      diagnostic modality that relies on robust sequence modeling. While Recurrent Neural 
      Networks (RNNs) have led to significant advances in automated diagnosis with 
      time-series data, they perform poorly when models are trained using a limited set of 
      channels. A crucial limitation of existing solutions is that they rely solely on 
      discriminative models, which tend to generalize poorly in such scenarios. In order 
      to combat this limitation, we develop a generative modeling approach to limited 
      channel ECG classification. This approach first uses a Seq2Seq model to implicitly 
      generate the missing channel information, and then uses the latent representation to 
      perform the actual supervisory task. This decoupling enables the use of unsupervised 
      data and also provides highly robust metric spaces for subsequent discriminative 
      learning. Our experiments with the Physionet dataset clearly evidence the 
      effectiveness of our approach over standard RNNs in disease prediction.

AB  - The purpose of the study was to compare the EASI system with the standard 12-lead 
      surface electrocardiogram (ECG) for the accuracy in detecting the main 
      electrocardiographic parameters (J point, PR, QT, and QRS) commonly monitored in 
      patients with acute coronary syndromes or heart failure. In this observational 
      comparative study, 253 patients who were consecutively admitted to the coronary care 
      unit with acute coronary syndrome or heart failure were evaluated. In all patients, 
      two complete 12-lead ECGs were acquired simultaneously. A total of 6,072 
      electrocardiographic leads were compared (3,036 standard and 3,036 EASI). No 
      significant differences were found between the investigate parameters of the two 
      measurement methods, either in patients with acute coronary syndrome or in those 
      with heart failure. This study confirmed the accuracy of the EASI system in 
      monitoring the main ECG parameters in patients admitted to the coronary care unit 
      with acute coronary syndrome or heart failure.

AB  - Over the past few years, reducing the number of false positive cardiac monitor 
      alarms (FA) in the intensive care unit (ICU) has become an issue of the utmost 
      importance. In our work, we developed a robust methodology that, without the need 
      for additional non-ECG waveforms, suppresses false positive ventricular tachycardia 
      (VT) alarms without resulting in false negative alarms. Our approach is based on 
      features extracted from the ECG signal 20 seconds prior to a triggered alarm. We 
      applied a multi resolution wavelet transform to the ECG data 20seconds prior to the 
      alarm trigger, extracted features from appropriately chosen scales and combined them 
      across all available leads. These representations are presented to a L1-regularized 
      logistic regression classifier. Results are shown in two datasets of physiological 
      waveforms with manually assessed cardiac monitor alarms: the MIMIC II dataset, where 
      we achieved a false alarm (FA) suppression of 21% with zero true alarm (TA) 
      suppression; and a dataset compiled by UCSF and General Electric, where a 36% FA 
      suppression was achieved with a zero TA suppression. The methodology described in 
      this work could be implemented to reduce the number of false monitor alarms in other 
      arrhythmias.

AB  - Automatic detection of fetal ECG features can assist in diagnosis of fetal cardiac 
      complications and may reduce the time required for diagnosis. Detection of the end 
      of the repolarization period wave in ECG has been proven challenging due to its low 
      amplitude and low frequency range. The prolongation of end of T-wave is associated 
      with sudden cardiac death, thus, methods that can accurately pinpoint it is highly 
      desirable for early diagnosis of cardiac diseases. In this paper, a technique based 
      on recurrence plots is developed for the detection of end of T-wave. The developed 
      technique was tested on maternal ECG (mECG), fetal scalp ECG (fsECG) and 
      non-invasive fetal ECG (nfECG) records. The technique was able to detect end of 
      T-waves in all of the mECG beats, 75% of the non-invasive fECG beats (verified by 
      simultaneously captured doppler ultrasound signals) and 78% of the fsECG beats. 
      Detection of fECG signals were more challenging than mECG signals due to the noise 
      and their low amplitude T-waves.

TI  - Objective study of sensor relevance for automatic cough detection.
PG  - 699-707
AB  - The development of a system for the automatic, objective, and reliable detection of 
      cough events is a need underlined by the medical literature for years. The benefit 
      of such a tool is clear as it would allow the assessment of pathology severity in 
      chronic cough diseases. Even though some approaches have recently reported solutions 
      achieving this task with a relative success, there is still no standardization about 
      the method to adopt or the sensors to use. The goal of this paper is to study 
      objectively the performance of several sensors for cough detection: ECG, thermistor, 
      chest belt, accelerometer, contact, and audio microphones. Experiments are carried 
      out on a database of 32 healthy subjects producing, in a confined room and in three 
      situations, voluntary cough at various volumes as well as other event categories 
      which can possibly lead to some detection errors: background noise, forced 
      expiration, throat clearing, speech, and laugh. The relevance of each sensor is 
      evaluated at three stages: mutual information conveyed by the features, ability to 
      discriminate at the frame level cough from these latter other sources of ambiguity, 
      and ability to detect cough events. In this latter experiment, with both an averaged 
      sensitivity and specificity of about 94.5%, the proposed approach is shown to 
      clearly outperform the commercial Karmelsonix system which achieved a specificity of 
      95.3% and a sensitivity of 64.9%.

TI  - Optimal data fusion for the improvement of QRS complex detection in multi-channel 
      ECG recordings.
PG  - 1673-1681
LID - 10.1007/s11517-019-01990-3 [doi]
AB  - The automatic analysis of the electrocardiogram (ECG) begins, traditionally, with 
      the detection of QRS complexes. Afterwards, useful information can be extracted from 
      it, ranging from the estimation of the instantaneous heart rate to nonlinear heart 
      rate variability analysis. A plethora of works have been published on this topic; 
      consequently, there exist many QRS complex detectors with high-performance values. 
      However, just a few detectors have been conceived that profit from the information 
      contained in several ECG leads to provide a robust QRS complex detection. In this 
      work, we explore the fusion of multi-channel ECG recordings QRS detections as a 
      means to improve the detection performance. This paper presents a decentralized 
      multi-channel QRS complex fusion scheme that optimally combines single-channel 
      detections to produce a single detection signal. Using six different widely used QRS 
      complex detectors on the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia and INCART databases, a reduction in 
      false and missed detections was achieved with the proposed approach compared with 
      the single-channel counterpart. Furthermore, our detection results are comparable 
      with the performance of other multi-channel detectors found in the literature, 
      showing, in turn, various advantages in scalability, adaptability, and simplicity in 
      the system's implementationGraphical AbstractN QRS complex detectors simultaneously 
      monitor N ECG channels. Once a detection occurs in a given channel, a 150 ms long 
      window is opened to look for detections in other channels. Within this window, y(n) 
      = + 1 if a QRS complex is detected and y(n) = - 1 otherwise. A coefficient α n, 
      obtained during a training period and related to the detection performance in 
      channel n, multiplies the detection signal y(n), so that greater weights are 
      assigned to ECG channels where single-channel detectors performed better. Finally, 
      the binary detection decision (f ) is obtained from the comparison of the weighted 
      sum of single-channel detections (z) with a fixed threshold (β).

TI  - A Globally Generalized Emotion Recognition System Involving Different Physiological 
      Signals.
LID - 10.3390/s18061905 [doi]
LID - 1905
AB  - Machine learning approaches for human emotion recognition have recently demonstrated 
      high performance. However, only/mostly for subject-dependent approaches, in a 
      variety of applications like advanced driver assisted systems, smart homes and 
      medical environments. Therefore, now the focus is shifted more towards 
      subject-independent approaches, which are more universal and where the emotion 
      recognition system is trained using a specific group of subjects and then tested on 
      totally new persons and thereby possibly while using other sensors of same 
      physiological signals in order to recognize their emotions. In this paper, we 
      explore a novel robust subject-independent human emotion recognition system, which 
      consists of two major models. The first one is an automatic feature calibration 
      model and the second one is a classification model based on Cellular Neural Networks 
      (CNN). The proposed system produces state-of-the-art results with an accuracy rate 
      between 80% and 89% when using the same elicitation materials and physiological 
      sensors brands for both training and testing and an accuracy rate of 71.05% when the 
      elicitation materials and physiological sensors brands used in training are 
      different from those used in training. Here, the following physiological signals are 
      involved: ECG (Electrocardiogram), EDA (Electrodermal activity) and ST 
      (Skin-Temperature).

AB  - This study aims to discover the characteristics of heart rate variability of resting 
      and real-time motional states in healthy population. The ECG data of 16 healthy 
      young subjects during 5-minute resting and motion periods were recorded 
      respectively. After that, the R wave was extracted through Hilbert transformation 
      and the RR interval time series was computed. The calculations for HRV parameters in 
      time and frequency domains, Poincaré scatter plots and the detrended fluctuation 
      analysis were conducted. Our study finds that, the measures of real-time motion in 
      time domain (Mean RR, SDNN and RMSSD), the measures in frequency domain (VLF, LF, 
      HF, TP), and the measures of Poincaré scatter plots are significantly less than 
      those of resting state (P <0.001). The measure of long-term fractal exponent (α(2)) 
      in real-time motion state is significantly higher than resting state (P <0.05). 
      Between the two states, there are no statistically significant differences in other 
      parameters of frequency domain (LF norm, HF norm, LF/HF) and short-term fractal 
      exponent (α(1)), P>0.05. This study suggests that, the results can provide new 
      characteristic signatures and statistical evidence for sport medicine or 
      rehabilitation medicine.

TI  - Methodological Comparisons of Heart Rate Variability Analysis in Patients With Type 
      2 Diabetes and Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Polymorphism.
PG  - 55-63
LID - 10.1109/JBHI.2015.2480778 [doi]
AB  - Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) polymorphism has been shown to be important in 
      hypertension progression and also in diabetes complications, especially associated 
      with heart disease. Heart rate variability (HRV) is an established measure for 
      classification of autonomic function regulating heart rate, based on the interbeat 
      interval time series derived from a raw ECG recording. Results of this paper show 
      that the length (number of interbeat intervals) and preprocessing of the tachogram 
      affect the HRV analysis outcome. The comparison was based on tachogram lengths of 
      250, 300, 350, and 400 RR-intervals and five preprocessing approaches. An automated 
      adaptive preprocessing method for the heart rate biosignal and tachogram length of 
      400 interbeat intervals provided the best classification. HRV results differed for 
      the Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) group between the I/I genotype and the I/D and 
      D/D genotypes, whereas for controls there was no significant difference in HRV 
      between genotypes. Selecting an appropriate length of recording and automated 
      preprocessing has confirmed that there is an effect of ACE polymorphism including 
      the I/I genotype and that I/I should not be combined with I/D genotype in 
      determining the extent of autonomic modulation of the heart rate.

TI  - A neural network system for detection of atrial fibrillation in ambulatory 
      electrocardiograms.
PG  - 602-8
AB  - INTRODUCTION: A neural network classifier has been designed, which is able to 
      distinguish atrial fibrillation (AF) from other supraventricular arrhythmias in 
      ambulatory (Holter) ECGs. METHOD AND RESULTS: The classification algorithm uses a 
      rhythm analysis that considers the ECG to be a time series of RR interval durations. 
      This is combined with an analysis of baseline morphology that considers the 
      morphological characteristics of the non-QRS portions of the waveform. A 
      backpropagation-based neural network has been used as part of the classifier 
      implementation. When applied to a library consisting exclusively of 42,970 examples 
      of AF and other supraventricular rhythm disturbances validated by an experienced 
      cardiologist, the algorithm demonstrated a sensitivity of 82.4% for 10-beat runs of 
      paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) and a specificity of 96.6%. Since this system 
      has been implemented as a postprocessor to a conventional automated Holter system, 
      operating only on segments of ECG that are known to contain supraventricular 
      arrhythmias rather than ventricular arrhythmias or sinus rhythm, it can be added to 
      most existing Holter processing systems without significantly increasing the average 
      time to process a tape. CONCLUSION: A neural network system has been designed, which 
      can potentially provide, for the first time, an accurate, quantitative technique to 
      determine the natural history of PAF and to evaluate potential treatments for PAF.

TI  - A Population Pharmacokinetic Model of Intravenous Dexmedetomidine for Mechanically 
      Ventilated Children after Neurosurgery.
LID - 10.3390/jcm8101563 [doi]
LID - 1563
AB  - Dexmedetomidine is a selective alpha-2 adrenergic agonist with concurrent sedative 
      and analgesic effects, and it is being increasingly used in pediatric anesthesia and 
      intensive care. This study aimed to investigate the pharmacokinetics of intravenous 
      dexmedetomidine in mechanically ventilated children in the intensive care unit (ICU) 
      after neurosurgery. Pediatric patients aged 2-12 years, who were mechanically 
      ventilated in ICU after neurosurgery, were allocated into a low-dose (n = 15) or 
      high-dose (n = 14) group. The low-dose group received dexmedetomidine at a loading 
      dose of 0.25 µg/kg for 10 min, followed by a maintenance dose of 0.25 µg/kg/h for 50 
      min, whereas the high-dose group received dexmedetomidine at a loading dose of 0.5 
      µg/kg for 10 min, followed by a maintenance dose of 0.5 µg/kg/h for 50 min. Serial 
      blood samples were collected for a pharmacokinetic analysis up to 480 min after the 
      end of the infusion. The sedative effect of dexmedetomidine was assessed using the 
      Bispectral Index and University of Michigan Sedation Scale. Adverse reactions, 
      electrocardiography findings, and vital signs were monitored for a safety 
      assessment. A population pharmacokinetic analysis was performed using non-linear 
      mixed effects modeling. Dexmedetomidine induced a moderate-to-deep degree of 
      sedation during infusion in both groups. The pharmacokinetics of dexmedetomidine 
      were best described by a two-compartment disposition model with first-order 
      elimination kinetics. The parameters were standardized for a body weight of 70 kg 
      using an allometric power model. The population estimates (95% confidence interval) 
      per 70 kg body weight were as follows: clearance of 81.0 (72.9-90.9) L/h, central 
      volume of distribution of 64.2 (50.6-81.0) L, intercompartment clearance of 116.4 
      (90.6-156.0) L/h, and peripheral volume of distribution of 167 (132-217) L. No 
      serious adverse reactions or hemodynamic changes requiring the discontinuation of 
      dexmedetomidine were observed. Dexmedetomidine had increased clearance and volume of 
      distribution in mechanically ventilated children in ICU after neurosurgery, thereby 
      indicating the need to adjust the dosage to obtain a target plasma concentration.

LID - 467
AB  - We present an innovative and robust solution to both biometric and emotion 
      identification using the electrocardiogram (ECG). The ECG represents the electrical 
      signal that comes from the contraction of the heart muscles, indirectly representing 
      the flow of blood inside the heart, it is known to convey a key that allows 
      biometric identification. Moreover, due to its relationship with the nervous system, 
      it also varies as a function of the emotional state. The use of 
      information-theoretic data models, associated with data compression algorithms, 
      allowed to effectively compare ECG records and infer the person identity, as well as 
      emotional state at the time of data collection. The proposed method does not require 
      ECG wave delineation or alignment, which reduces preprocessing error. The method is 
      divided into three steps: (1) conversion of the real-valued ECG record into a 
      symbolic time-series, using a quantization process; (2) conditional compression of 
      the symbolic representation of the ECG, using the symbolic ECG records stored in the 
      database as reference; (3) identification of the ECG record class, using a 1-NN 
      (nearest neighbor) classifier. We obtained over 98% of accuracy in biometric 
      identification, whereas in emotion recognition we attained over 90%. Therefore, the 
      method adequately identify the person, and his/her emotion. Also, the proposed 
      method is flexible and may be adapted to different problems, by the alteration of 
      the templates for training the model.

TI  - Medical Waveform Format Encoding Rules Representation of Neurointensive Care 
      Waveform Data.
PG  - 183-188
LID - 10.1007/978-3-319-65798-1_38 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Technology in neurointensive care units can collect and store vast 
      amounts of complex patient data. The CHART-ADAPT project is aimed at developing 
      technology that will allow for the collection, analysis and use of these big data at 
      the patient's bedside in neurointensive care units. A requirement of this project is 
      to automatically extract and transfer high-frequency waveform data (e.g. ICP) from 
      monitoring equipment to high performance computing infrastructure for analysis. 
      Currently, no agreed data standard exists in neurointensive care for the description 
      of this type of data. In this pilot study, we investigated the use of Medical 
      Waveform Format Encoding Rules (MFER- www.mfer.org-ISO 11073-92001) as a possible 
      data standard for neurointensive care waveform data. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Several 
      waveform formats were explored (e.g. XML, DICOM waveform) and evaluated for 
      suitability given existing computing infrastructure constraints, e.g. NHS network 
      capacity and the processing capabilities of existing integration software. Key 
      requirements of the format included a compact data size and the use of a recognised 
      standard. The MFER waveform format (ISO/TS 11073-92001) met both requirements. To 
      evaluate the practicality of the MFER waveform format, seven waveform signals (ICP, 
      ECG, ART, CVP, EtCO2, Pleth, Resp) collected over a period of 8 h from a patient at 
      the Institute of Neurological Sciences in Glasgow were converted into MFER waveform 
      format. RESULTS: The MFER waveform format has two main components: sampling 
      information and frame information. Sampling information describes the frequency of 
      the data sampling and the resolution of the data. Frame information describes the 
      data itself; it consists of three elements: data block (the actual data), channel 
      (each type of waveform data occupies a channel) and sequence (the repetition of the 
      data). All seven waveform signals were automatically and successfully converted into 
      the MFER waveform format. One MFER file was created for each minute of data (total 
      of 479 files, 181 KB each). CONCLUSIONS: The MFER waveform format has potential as a 
      lightweight standard for representing high-frequency neurointensive care waveform 
      data. Further work will include a comparison with other waveform data formats and a 
      live trial of using the MFER waveform format to stream patient data over a longer 
      period.

      dual-heartbeat computed tomography coronary angiography (CTCA) with automatic 
      exposure control (AEC) yields images with uniform image noise at reduced radiation 
      doses. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using an anthropomorphic chest CT phantom we performed 
      prospectively ECG-gated single- and dual-heartbeat CTCA on a second-generation 
      320-multidetector CT volume scanner. The exposure phase window was set at 75%, 
      70-80%, 40-80%, and 0-100% and the heart rate at 60 or 80 or corr80 bpm; images were 
      reconstructed with filtered back projection (FBP) or iterative reconstruction (IR, 
      adaptive iterative dose reduction 3D). We applied AEC and set the image noise level 
      to 20 or 25 HU. For each technique we determined the image noise and the radiation 
      dose to the phantom center. RESULTS: With half-scan reconstruction at 60 bpm, a 
      70-80% phase window- and a 20-HU standard deviation (SD) setting, the imagenoise 
      level and -variation along the z axis manifested similar curves with FBP and IR. 
      With half-scan reconstruction, the radiation dose to the phantom center with 70-80% 
      phase window was 18.89 and 12.34 mGy for FBP and 4.61 and 3.10 mGy for IR at an SD 
      setting SD of 20 and 25 HU, respectively. At 80 bpm with two-segment reconstruction 
      the dose was approximately twice that of 60 bpm at both SD settings. However, 
      increasing radiation dose at corr80 bpm was suppressed to 1.39 times compared to 60 
      bpm. CONCLUSION: AEC at ECG-gated single- and dual-heartbeat CTCA controls the image 
      noise at different radiation dose.

LID - 10.1109/TITB.2011.2128337 [doi]
AB  - A ballistocardiograph records the mechanical activity of the heart. We present a 
      novel algorithm for the detection of individual heart beats and beat-to-beat 
      interval lengths in ballistocardiograms (BCGs) from healthy subjects. An automatic 
      training step based on unsupervised learning techniques is used to extract the shape 
      of a single heart beat from the BCG. Using the learned parameters, the occurrence of 
      individual heart beats in the signal is detected. A final refinement step improves 
      the accuracy of the estimated beat-to-beat interval lengths. Compared to many 
      existing algorithms, the new approach offers heart rate estimates on a beat-to-beat 
      basis. The agreement of the proposed algorithm with an ECG reference has been 
      evaluated. A relative beat-to-beat interval error of 1.79% with a coverage of 95.94% 
      was achieved on recordings from 16 subjects.

AB  - Energy harvesting devices are widely discussed as an alternative power source for 
      todays active implantable medical devices. Repeated battery replacement procedures 
      can be avoided by extending the implants life span, which is the goal of energy 
      harvesting concepts. This reduces the risk of complications for the patient and may 
      even reduce device size. The continuous and powerful contractions of a human heart 
      ideally qualify as a battery substitute. In particular, devices in close proximity 
      to the heart such as pacemakers, defibrillators or bio signal (ECG) recorders would 
      benefit from this alternative energy source. The clockwork of an automatic 
      wristwatch was used to transform the hearts kinetic energy into electrical energy. 
      In order to qualify as a continuous energy supply for the consuming device, the 
      mechanism needs to demonstrate its harvesting capability under various conditions. 
      Several in-vivo recorded heart motions were used as input of a mathematical model to 
      optimize the clockworks original conversion efficiency with respect to myocardial 
      contractions. The resulting design was implemented and tested during in-vitro and 
      in-vivo experiments, which demonstrated the superior sensitivity of the new design 
      for all tested heart motions.

TI  - Nonlinear mathematical analysis of the hemodynamic parameters during left 
      ventricular assistance with oscillated blood flow.
PG  - 625-9
AB  - For the development of a totally implantable ventricular assist system (VAS), we 
      have been developing the vibrating flow pump (VFP), which can generate oscillated 
      blood flow with a relatively high frequency (10-50 Hz) for a totally implantable 
      system. In this study, effects of left ventricular assistance with this unique 
      oscillated blood flow were analyzed by nonlinear mathematics for evaluation as the 
      entire circulatory regulatory system, not as a separate part of the system. Left 
      heart bypasses using VFPs from the left atriums to the descending aortas were 
      performed in chronic animal experiments using healthy adult goats. Electrocardiogram 
      (ECG), arterial blood pressure, VFP pump flow, and flow of the descending aorta data 
      taken while the goats were awake were recorded in the data recorder and analyzed in 
      the personal computer system through the AD convertor. Using nonlinear mathematics, 
      time series data were embedded into the phase space, and the Lyapunov numerical 
      method, fractal dimension analysis, and power spectrum analysis were performed to 
      evaluate the nonlinear dynamics. During left ventricular assistance with the VFP, 
      Mayer wave fluctuations were decreased in the power spectrum, the fractal dimension 
      of the hemodynamics was significantly decreased, and peripheral vascular resistance 
      was significantly decreased. These results suggest that nonlinear dynamics, which 
      mediate the cardiovascular dynamics, may be affected during LV bypass with 
      oscillated flow. Decreased power of the Mayer wave in the spectrum caused the limit 
      cycle attractor of the hemodynamics and decreased the peripheral resistance. 
      Decreased sympathetic discharges may be the origin of the decreased Mayer wave and 
      fractal dimension. These nonlinear dynamical analyses may be useful to design the 
      optimal VAS control.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Fluoxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) commonly 
      used in the treatment of depression. While most intoxications with SSRI's have 
      favorable outcomes and do not require interventions other than strict observation of 
      vital signs and heart rhythm, clinicians should be aware of the life-threatening 
      complications that may occur. CASE PRESENTATION: A 61-year-old woman presented to 
      the emergency department after an intentional multiple drug overdose. Upon 
      examination, she was somnolent with stable respiration and hemodynamics. 
      Electrocardiography showed a prolonged QTc interval of 503 ms. The patient was 
      admitted to the ICU for cardiopulmonary monitoring. During admission, the patient 
      remained stable and showed improved neurologic function over time. After 22 h, a 
      second ECG showed normalization of the QTc interval to 458 ms. However, 36 to 40 h 
      after admission, our patient developed recurrent episodes of Torsades de Pointes 
      (TdP) with loss of cardiac output, leading to cardiopulmonary resuscitation. 
      Spontaneous circulation was restored after intravenous administration of magnesium 
      sulphate. Retrospective serum analysis revealed fluoxetine concentrations of 
      2700 mcg/l. CONCLUSION: Most intoxications with selective serotonin reuptake 
      inhibitors (SSRI) have favorable outcomes and do not require medical interventions 
      other than strict cardiopulmonary observation. However, higher doses have been 
      associated with QTc interval prolongation, TdP, serotonin syndrome, and death. This 
      case illustrates that life-threatening complications may occur late in the course of 
      hospital admission. Even though overdoses with SSRI's generally result in few 
      fatalities, clinicians should be aware of the life-threatening clinical 
      manifestations that may occur. Despite being an imperfect predictor of imminent TdP, 
      continuous monitoring of cardiac rhythm is strongly recommended when either cardiac 
      or non-cardiac symptoms are present.

TI  - Bipolar radiofrequency ablation is useful for treating atrial fibrillation combined 
      with heart valve diseases.
PG  - 32
LID - 10.1186/1471-2482-14-32 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common arrhymia, and it results in 
      increased risk of thromboembolism and decreased cardiac function. In patients 
      undergoing cardiac surgery, concomitant radiofrequency ablation to treat AF is 
      effective in restoring sinus rhythm (SR). This study is an observational cohort 
      study aimed to investigate the safety and efficacy of bipolar radiofrequency 
      ablation (BRFA) for treating AF combined with heart valve diseases. METHODS: 
      Clinical data were analyzed retrospectively from 324 cases of rheumatic heart 
      disease combined with persistent AF patients who underwent valve replacement 
      concomitant BRFA. The modified left atrial and the simplified right atrial ablation 
      were used for AF treatments. Of the 324 patients, 248 patients underwent mitral 
      valve replacement and 76 patients underwent double valve replacement. Meanwhile, 54 
      patients underwent concomitant thrombectomy and 97 underwent tricuspid 
      valvuloplasty. And all of them received temporary pacemaker implantation. The 24 
      hours holter electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring and echocardiography was performed 
      before the operation, on the first day after operation, on discharge day, and at 6 
      and 12 months after operation. RESULTS: There were 299 patients with SR on the first 
      day after operation (92.30%), 12 patients with junctional rhythm (3.70%), 11 
      patients with AF (3.39%), and 2 patients with atrial flutter (0.62%). The temporary 
      pacemaker was used in 213 patients (65.74%) with heart rates less than 70 
      beat/minute in the ICU. Two patients died early and the mortality rate was 0.62%. 
      Two patients had left ventricular rupture and the occurrence rate was 0.62%. They 
      both recovered. There was no degree III atrioventricular blockage and no permanent 
      pacemaker implantation. Overall survival rate was 99.38% (322 cases) with SR 
      conversion rate of 89.13% (287 cases) at discharge. The SR conversion rate was 
      87.54% and 87.01% at 6 and 12 months after operation. Sinus bradycardia occurred in 
      3.42% of patients at 6 months after operation and in 3.03% of patients at 12 months 
      after operation. Echocardiography showed that the left atrial diameter was 
      significantly decreased, and ejection fraction and fractional shortening were 
      significantly improved. CONCLUSIONS: BRFA for treating AF in concomitant valve 
      replacement is safe and with good efficacy.

      Neural Networks.

AB  - Cardiac activity has been monitored continuously in daily life by virtue of advanced 
      medical instruments with microelectromechanical system (MEMS) technology. 
      Seismocardiography (SCG) has been considered to be free from the burden of 
      measurement for cardiac activity, but it has been limited in its application in 
      daily life. The most important issues regarding SCG are to overcome the limitations 
      of motion artifacts due to the sensitivity of motion sensor. Although novel adaptive 
      filters for noise cancellation have been developed, they depend on the 
      researcher&rsquo;s subjective decision. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can 
      extract significant features from data automatically without a researcher&rsquo;s 
      subjective decision, so that signal processing has been recently replaced as CNNs. 
      Thus, this study aimed to develop a novel method to enhance heart rate estimation 
      from thoracic movement by CNNs. Thoracic movement was measured by six-axis 
      accelerometer and gyroscope signals using a wearable sensor that can be worn by 
      simply clipping on clothes. The dataset was collected from 30 participants (15 
      males, 15 females) using 12 measurement conditions according to two physical 
      conditions (i.e., relaxed and aroused conditions), three body postures (i.e., 
      sitting, standing, and supine), and six movement speeds (i.e., 3.2, 4.5, 5.8, 6.4, 
      8.5, and 10.3 km/h). The motion data (i.e., six-axis accelerometer and gyroscope) 
      and heart rate (i.e., electrocardiogram (ECG)) were determined as the input data and 
      labels in the dataset, respectively. The CNN model was developed based on VGG Net 
      and optimized by testing according to network depth and data augmentation. The 
      ensemble network of the VGG-16 without data augmentation and the VGG-19 with data 
      augmentation was determined as optimal architecture for generalization. As a result, 
      the proposed method showed higher accuracy than the previous SCG method using signal 
      processing in most measurement conditions. The three main contributions are as 
      follows: (1) the CNN model enhanced heart rate estimation with the benefits of 
      automatic feature extraction from the data; (2) the proposed method was compared 
      with the previous SCG method using signal processing; (3) the method was tested in 
      12 measurement conditions related to daily motion for a more practical application.

TI  - Automatic Removal of Cardiac Interference (ARCI): A New Approach for EEG Data.
PG  - 441
LID - 10.3389/fnins.2019.00441 [doi]
LID - 441
AB  - EEG recordings are generally affected by interference from physiological and 
      non-physiological sources which may obscure underlying brain activity and hinder 
      effective EEG analysis. In particular, cardiac interference can be caused by the 
      electrical activity of the heart and/or cardiovascular activity related to blood 
      flow. Successful EEG application in sports science settings requires a method for 
      artifact removal that is automatic and flexible enough to be applied in a variety of 
      acquisition conditions without requiring simultaneous ECG recordings that could 
      restrict movement. We developed an automatic method for classifying and removing 
      both electrical cardiac and cardiovascular artifacts (ARCI) that does not require 
      additional ECG recording. Our method employs independent component analysis (ICA) to 
      isolate data independent components (ICs) and identifies the artifactual ICs by 
      evaluating specific IC features in the time and frequency domains. We applied ARCI 
      to EEG datasets with cued artifacts and acquired during an eyes-closed condition. 
      Data were recorded using a standard EEG wet cap with either 128 or 64 electrodes and 
      using a novel dry electrode cap with either 97 or 64 dry electrodes. All data were 
      decomposed into different numbers of components to evaluate the effect of ICA 
      decomposition level on effective cardiac artifact detection. ARCI performance was 
      evaluated by comparing automatic ICs classifications with classifications performed 
      by experienced investigators. Automatic and investigator classifications were highly 
      consistent resulting in an overall accuracy greater than 99% in all datasets and 
      decomposition levels, and an average sensitivity greater than 90%. Best results were 
      attained when data were decomposed into a fewer number of components where the 
      method achieved perfect sensitivity (100%). Performance was also evaluated by 
      comparing automatic component classification with externally recorded ECG. Results 
      showed that ICs automatically classified as artifactual were significantly 
      correlated with ECG activity whereas the other ICs were not. We also assessed that 
      the interference affecting EEG signals was reduced by more than 82% after automatic 
      artifact removal. Overall, ARCI represents a significant step in the detection and 
      removal of cardiac-related EEG artifacts and can be applied in a variety of 
      acquisition settings making it ideal for sports science applications.

TI  - Automatic coronary calcium scoring in low-dose chest computed tomography.
PG  - 2322-34
LID - 10.1109/TMI.2012.2216889 [doi]
AB  - The calcium burden as estimated from non-ECG-synchronized computed tomography (CT) 
      exams acquired in screening of heavy smokers has been shown to be a strong predictor 
      of cardiovascular events. We present a method for automatic coronary calcium scoring 
      with low-dose, non-contrast-enhanced, non-ECG-synchronized chest CT. First, a 
      probabilistic coronary calcium map was created using multi-atlas segmentation. This 
      map assigned an a priori probability for the presence of coronary calcifications at 
      every location in a scan. Subsequently, a statistical pattern recognition system was 
      designed to identify coronary calcifications by texture, size, and spatial features; 
      the spatial features were computed using the coronary calcium map. The detected 
      calcifications were quantified in terms of volume and Agatston score. The best 
      results were obtained by merging the results of three different supervised 
      classification systems, namely direct classification with a nearest neighbor 
      classifier, and two-stage classification with nearest neighbor and support vector 
      machine classifiers.We used a total of 231 test scans containing 45,674 mm³ of 
      coronary calcifications. The presented method detected on average 157/198 mm³ 
      (sensitivity 79.2%) of coronary calcium volume with on average 4 mm false positive 
      volume. Calcium scoring can be performed automatically in low-dose, non-contrast 
      enhanced, non-ECG-synchronized chest CT in screening of heavy smokers to identify 
      subjects who might benefit from preventive treatment.

TI  - Analysis of the characteristics and management of critical values in a newborn 
      tertiary center in China.
PG  - 49-56
LID - 10.1007/s12519-016-0058-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Critical value reporting has been widely adopted by hospitals throughout 
      the world, but there were few reports about neonatal critical values. This study 
      aimed to analyze characteristics of the neonatal critical values considered at our 
      center and to provide information on improving neonatal intensive care. METHODS: A 
      retrospective study of critical values at a newborn tertiary center in China was 
      conducted to assess neonatal critical values according to test, distribution, 
      reporting time, patient outcome and the impact to the therapy. RESULTS: In total, 
      926 critical values were recorded. Overall, 66.52% (616/926) of the items were 
      reported within 24 hours of admission, 50.28% (465/926) during duty times and 54.75% 
      (507/926) in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). The routine coagulation test 
      was the most frequent source of critical values. Electrocardiography, blood gas 
      analysis and therapeutic drug monitoring of drug levels were associated with the 
      highest rates of treatment intervention (100%); routine coagulation tests were the 
      lowest (23.14%). Sample quality was the main cause of false-positive critical 
      values. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of neonatal critical values peaked during the 
      first 24 hours post-admission and during duty periods. Each newborn center needs to 
      enact rapid treatment guidelines to address common critical values in order to 
      facilitate clinical interventions. Periodically reviewing critical values could help 
      to optimize clinical practices.

AB  - Using BRAVO algorithm (AMPS-LLC, NY, v4.4.0), 5223 ECGs from a publicly available 
      annotated dataset from a randomized clinical trial on four different compounds and 
      placebo were analyzed. ECGs were automatically processed and JTp interval was 
      computed on: 12 standard ECG leads, Vector Magnitude (VM), and root mean square 
      (RMS) leads. On VM and RMS, JTp intervals were nearly identical (228 ± 29 vs. 
      227 ± 30 ms respectively, with correlation of 0.99, p < 0.0001). On lead II, JTp 
      interval was about 10 ms longer, but highly correlated with that measured on VM 
      (0.94, p < 0.0001). Similarly, on lead V5, JTp was about 8 ms longer than on VM, 
      with a correlation of 0.95, p < 0.0001. When compared to the public available 
      annotations, JTp by BRAVO generated longer (about 8 ms) measurement and evidenced 
      outliers conducible to both the T-wave peak (in few ECGs presenting notched shapes) 
      and, to a lesser degree, to the J point, due to variability of the two algorithms. 
      Differences on the drug-induced effect from the four compounds were negligible.

TI  - Accurate automated apnea analysis in preterm infants.
PG  - 157-62
LID - 10.1055/s-0033-1343769 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: In 2006 the apnea of prematurity (AOP) consensus group identified 
      inaccurate counting of apnea episodes as a major barrier to progress in AOP 
      research. We compare nursing records of AOP to events detected by a clinically 
      validated computer algorithm that detects apnea from standard bedside monitors. 
      STUDY DESIGN: Waveform, vital sign, and alarm data were collected continuously from 
      all very low-birth-weight infants admitted over a 25-month period, analyzed for 
      central apnea, bradycardia, and desaturation (ABD) events, and compared with nursing 
      documentation collected from charts. Our algorithm defined apnea as > 10 seconds if 
      accompanied by bradycardia and desaturation. RESULTS: Of the 3,019 nurse-recorded 
      events, only 68% had any algorithm-detected ABD event. Of the 5,275 
      algorithm-detected prolonged apnea events > 30 seconds, only 26% had nurse-recorded 
      documentation within 1 hour. Monitor alarms sounded in only 74% of events of 
      algorithm-detected prolonged apnea events > 10 seconds. There were 8,190,418 monitor 
      alarms of any description throughout the neonatal intensive care unit during the 747 
      days analyzed, or one alarm every 2 to 3 minutes per nurse. CONCLUSION: An automated 
      computer algorithm for continuous ABD quantitation is a far more reliable tool than 
      the medical record to address the important research questions identified by the 
      2006 AOP consensus group.

AB  - We report on two new physiological phenomena: the long-term and total heart rate 
      asymmetry, which describe a significantly larger contribution of heart rate 
      accelerations to long-term and total heart rate variability. In addition to the 
      existing pair of indices, SD1(d); SD1(a); which are based on partitioning short-term 
      variance, we introduce two other pairs of descriptors based on partitioning longterm 
      (SD2(d); SD2(a)) and total (SDNN(d); SDNN(a)) heart rate variability. The new 
      asymmetric descriptors are used to analyze RR intervals time series derived from the 
      30-min ECG recordings of 241 healthy subjects resting in supine position. It is 
      shown that both new types of asymmetry are present in 76% of the subjects. The new 
      phenomena reported here are real physiological findings rather than artifacts of the 
      method since they vanish after data shuffling.

TI  - A preliminary study on the influence of obstructive sleep apnea upon cumulative 
      parasympathetic system activity.
PG  - 242-6
LID - 10.1016/j.anl.2007.11.001 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Although the autonomic nervous system plays a key role in mediating 
      cardiovascular changes during obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), parasympathetic nervous 
      system (PNS) activity during sleep apnea has not yet been sufficiently investigated. 
      This study is to discuss the relationship between PNS activity and OSA. METHODS: 
      Polysomnography recording was carried out in 76 patients (71 male and 5 female) with 
      OSA. Cumulative PNS activity during sleep for each patient was derived from time 
      series data of electrocardiogram (ECG) and analyzed by coarse graining spectral 
      analysis of heart rate variability. The correlation between cumulative PNS activity 
      and apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) was then discussed. RESULTS: Cumulative PNS activity 
      and PNS peaks during sleep were lowly but significantly correlated with OSA severity 
      (r=-0.344, p<0.005; and r=-0.266, p<0.05 respectively), and a linear regression 
      equation could be established. Furthermore, significant correlation was also 
      observed in the adult groups and in the moderate and severe groups, but not in the 
      juvenile and the elderly and mild groups. CONCLUSION: These findings indicated that 
      PNS function was obviously influenced by OSA during sleep. Cumulative PNS activity 
      level might also serve as a useful parameter for the evaluation of OSA.

TI  - Multifractal characterisation of electrocardiographic RR and QT time-series before 
      and after progressive exercise.
PG  - 176-85
LID - 10.1016/j.cmpb.2012.02.014 [doi]
AB  - The scaling (fractal) characteristics of electrocardiograms (ECG) provide 
      information complementary to traditional linear measurements (heart rate, 
      repolarisation rate etc.) allowing them to discriminate signal changes induced 
      pathologically or pharmacologically. Under such interventions scaling behaviour is 
      described by multiple local scaling exponents and the signal is termed multifractal. 
      Exercise testing is used extensively to quantify and monitor cardiorespiratory 
      health, yet to our knowledge there has been no previous multifractal investigation 
      of exercise-induced changes in heart rate dynamics. Ambulatory ECGs were acquired 
      from eight healthy participants. Linear descriptive statistics and a 
      parameterisation of multifractal singularity spectra were determined for inter-beat 
      (RR) and intra-beat (QT) time-series before and after exercise. Multivariate 
      analyses of both linear and multifractal measures discriminated between pre- and 
      post-exercise periods and proportionally more significant correlations were observed 
      between linear than between multifractal measures. Variance was more uniformly 
      distributed over the first three principal components for multifractal measures and 
      the two classes of measures were uncorrelated. Order and phase randomisation of the 
      time-series indicated that both sample distribution and correlation properties 
      contribute to multifractalilty. This exploratory study indicates the possibility of 
      using physical exercise in conjunction with multifractal methodology as an 
      adjunctive description of autonomically mediated modulation of heart rate.

AB  - Acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) is a major public health problem throughout 
      the world and its importance is continuing to grow. More than 50% of ADHF patients 
      have coronary artery disease, which is generally associated with a history of 
      hypertension. Recent data suggest that half of the patients presenting with acute 
      heart failure have preserved left ventricular systolic function. The diagnosis of 
      ADHF may be difficult at times, and the clinical assessment and patient profiling is 
      essential for appropriate therapy. Immediate therapeutic goals are not only to 
      improve symptoms, restore oxygenation and stabilize hemodynamic conditions, but also 
      to improve short- and long-term survival. In addition to general supportive measures 
      such as oxygen supplementation, noninvasive ventilation, analgesia, diuretics, 
      vasodilators together with inotropic agents and/or vasopressors remain the 
      cornerstone of therapy in patients with ADHF.

TI  - Low Resource Complexity R-peak Detection Based on Triangle Template Matching and 
      Moving Average Filter.
LID - 10.3390/s19183997 [doi]
LID - 3997
AB  - A novel R-peak detection algorithm suitable for wearable electrocardiogram (ECG) 
      devices is proposed with four objectives: robustness to noise, low latency 
      processing, low resource complexity, and automatic tuning of parameters. The 
      approach is a two-pronged algorithm comprising (1) triangle template matching to 
      accentuate the slope information of the R-peaks and (2) a single moving average 
      filter to define a dynamic threshold for peak detection. The proposed algorithm was 
      validated on eight ECG public databases. The obtained results not only presented 
      good accuracy, but also low resource complexity, all of which show great potential 
      for detection R-peaks in ECG signals collected from wearable devices.

TI  - A Fast Multimodal Ectopic Beat Detection Method Applied for Blood Pressure 
      Estimation Based on Pulse Wave Velocity Measurements in Wearable Sensors.
LID - 10.3390/s17010158 [doi]
LID - 158
AB  - Automatic detection of ectopic beats has become a thoroughly researched topic, with 
      literature providing manifold proposals typically incorporating morphological 
      analysis of the electrocardiogram (ECG). Although being well understood, its 
      utilization is often neglected, especially in practical monitoring situations like 
      online evaluation of signals acquired in wearable sensors. Continuous blood pressure 
      estimation based on pulse wave velocity considerations is a prominent example, which 
      depends on careful fiducial point extraction and is therefore seriously affected 
      during periods of increased occurring extrasystoles. In the scope of this work, a 
      novel ectopic beat discriminator with low computational complexity has been 
      developed, which takes advantage of multimodal features derived from ECG and pulse 
      wave relating measurements, thereby providing additional information on the 
      underlying cardiac activity. Moreover, the blood pressure estimations' vulnerability 
      towards ectopic beats is closely examined on records drawn from the Physionet 
      database as well as signals recorded in a small field study conducted in a geriatric 
      facility for the elderly. It turns out that a reliable extrasystole identification 
      is essential to unsupervised blood pressure estimation, having a significant impact 
      on the overall accuracy. The proposed method further convinces by its applicability 
      to battery driven hardware systems with limited processing power and is a favorable 
      choice when access to multimodal signal features is given anyway.

TI  - [Application of fuzzy reasoning to myocardial ischemia judgment based on 
      electrocardiogram ST-T complex].
PG  - 147-51, 156
AB  - Electrocardiogram (ECG) is a convenient, economic, and non-invasive detecting tool 
      in myocardial ischemia (MI). Its clinical appearance is mainly exhibited by ST-T 
      complex change. MI events are usually instantaneous and asymptomatic in some cases, 
      which cannot be forecasted to have a precautionary measure in time by doctors. The 
      automatic detection of MI by computer and a cued warning of danger in real time play 
      an important role in diagnosing heart disease. With the help of the medical staff, 
      some quantitative approbatory indicators, such as ST-segment deviation, the 
      amplitude of T-wave peak and the rate of ST and heart rate (HR), were combined to 
      judge MI using fuzzy reasoning. After MIT-BIH database and the long-term ST database 
      (LTST) verification, sensitivity and positive predictive values reached 75% and 78% 
      respectively, and specificity and negative predictive values were 85% and 87% 
      respectively. In addition, the proposed method was close to human way of thinking 
      and understanding, and easy to apply in clinical detection and engineering fields.

TI  - Continuous ST-segment monitoring: nurses' attitudes, practices, and quality of 
      patient care.
PG  - 226-37; quiz 238
LID - 10.4037/ajcc2011129 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Continuous ischemia monitoring helps identify patients with acute, but 
      often silent, myocardial ischemia. Evidence suggests nurses do not activate ischemia 
      monitoring because they think it is difficult to use. ST-Map software incorporates 
      graphic displays to make monitoring of ongoing ischemia easier. OBJECTIVES: To 
      determine if nurses' use of and attitude toward ischemia monitoring and the quality 
      of patient care improve with use of ST-Map. METHODS: The study included 61 nurses 
      and 202 patients with acute coronary syndrome in a cardiac intensive care unit. 
      Baseline data on nurses' use of and attitude toward ischemia monitoring and quality 
      of care were obtained. Education was then provided and ST-Map software was installed 
      on all monitors. Follow-up data were obtained 4 months later. RESULTS: The 
      percentage of nurses who had ever used ischemia monitoring was 13% before ST Map and 
      90% afterward (P < .001). The most common reason for not using ischemia monitoring 
      before ST Map was inadequate knowledge (62%). The most common reason for liking 
      ischemia monitoring after ST Map was knowing when a patient has ischemia (80%). Time 
      to acquisition of a 12-lead electrocardiogram in response to symptoms or ST-segment 
      changes was 5 to 15 minutes before ST Map and always less than 5 minutes afterward 
      (P < .001). Time to return to the catheterization laboratory did not differ before 
      and after ST Map. CONCLUSIONS: ST Map was associated with more frequent use of 
      ischemia monitoring, improved attitudes of nurses toward ischemia monitoring, and 
      shorter time to obtaining 12-lead electrocardiograms.

TI  - Influence of 2nd-degree AV blocks, ECG recording length, and recording time on heart 
      rate variability analyses in horses.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the influence of 2nd-degree AV blocks (AVB) on RR 
      interval-based heart rate variability (HRV) variables; to investigate the effect of 
      using PP interval time series and of artifact filtering on HRV analyses; to 
      investigate the influence of electrocardiogram (ECG) recording length and time of 
      recording; and to calculate day-to-day variability and reference intervals of HRV 
      variables. ANIMALS: Thirty healthy adult horses. METHODS: RR and PP interval time 
      series were extracted from 10-h Holter ECGs and an automated filter was applied to 
      the RR time series (RR(f)). Time-domain HRV variables were calculated based on RR, 
      PP, and RR(f) time series and their relation to the number of AVBs was assessed. 
      Hourly 10- and 60-min segments were extracted to investigate the influence of 
      segment length and recording time on HRV variables. Day-to-day variability and 
      reference intervals of HRV variables were calculated. RESULTS: Variables of 
      short-term HRV were significantly influenced by the number of AVBs when based on RR, 
      but not when based on PP- and RR(f) time series. PP- and RR(f)-based HRV variables 
      were in good agreement. The majority of HRV variables were influenced by recording 
      time and ECG segment length. Day-to-day variability of HRV variables was low when 
      based on 10-h ECG recordings but moderate to high when based on 60-min and 10-min 
      recordings. CONCLUSIONS: Second-degree AVBs significantly influence conventional 
      RR-based, but not PP- and RR(f)-based time-domain HRV variables. However, PP and 
      RR(f) analyses have limitations and recording length and time of recording must be 
      considered.

PG  - 8360475
LID - 10.1155/2018/8360475 [doi]
LID - 8360475
AB  - DATABASE: The efficiency and robustness of the proposed method has been tested on 
      Fantasia Database (FTD), MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database (MIT-AD), and MIT-BIH Normal 
      Sinus Rhythm Database (MIT-NSD). AIM: Because of the importance of QRS complex in 
      the diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases, improvement in accuracy of its measurement 
      has been set as a target. The present study provides an algorithm for automatic 
      detection of QRS complex on the ECG signal, with the benefit of energy and reduced 
      impact of noise on the ECG signal. METHOD: The method is basically based on the 
      Teager energy operator (TEO), which facilitates the detection of the baseline 
      threshold and extracts QRS complex from the ECG signal. RESULTS: The testing of the 
      undertaken method on the Fanatasia Database showed the following results: 
      sensitivity (Se) = 99.971%, positive prediction (P+) = 99.973%, detection error rate 
      (DER) = 0.056%, and accuracy (Acc) = 99.944%. On MIT-AD involvement, Se = 99.74%, 
      P+ = 99.97%, DER = 0.291%, and Acc = 99.71%. On MIT-NSD involvement, Se = 99.878%, 
      P+ = 99.989%, DER = 0.134%, and Acc = 99.867%. CONCLUSION: Despite the closeness of 
      the recorded peaks which inflicts a constraint in detection of the two consecutive 
      QRS complexes, the proposed method, by applying 4 simple and quick steps, has 
      effectively and reliably detected the QRS complexes which make it suitable for 
      practical purposes and applications.

TI  - Joint symbolic dynamics as an effective approach to study the influence of 
      respiratory phase on baroreflex function.
PG  - 49-52
LID - 10.1109/EMBC.2013.6609434 [doi]
AB  - This study sought to employ a novel approach based on joint symbolic dynamics (JSD) 
      to study the influence of respiratory phase on baroreflex function. We recorded 
      electrocardiograms (ECG), blood pressure and respiration in 10 (5 male/5 female) 
      healthy experienced athletes. For our analysis, time series of R-R intervals and 
      systolic blood pressure were extracted, and respiratory phases were obtained using 
      the Hilbert transform. Based on the changes between successive values, each series 
      was transformed into binary symbol vectors, and words of length '2' were formed. 
      From parallel analysis of the symbolic dynamics in the three time series, the 
      relationship between respiratory phases and baroreflex function was quantified. We 
      analysed baroreflex patterns via different word combinations for specific 
      respiratory phases and observed that baroreflex patterns occurred at similar 
      frequency during expiration, inspiration and phase transitions (25.0±14.4% vs. 
      33.4±19.5%, expiration-inspiration: 25.0±12.6% and inspiration-expiration: 
      22.1±17.4%, respectively). From this study, it appears that JSD provides a novel and 
      efficient technique for the combined analysis of interactions between respiration, 
      heart rate and blood pressure.

TI  - Cuff-less Blood Pressure Measurement Based on Deep Convolutional Neural Network.
PG  - 3775-3778
LID - 10.1109/EMBC.2019.8856588 [doi]
AB  - Cuff-less blood pressure (BP) monitoring is increasingly being needed for 
      cardiovascular events management in clinical. Many of the existing methods, however, 
      are based on manual feature extraction, which cannot characterize the complex 
      relationship between the physiological signals and BP. In this study, the 16-layer 
      VGGNet was used to construct cuff-less BP from electrocardiogram (ECG) and pressure 
      pulse wave (PPW) signals, with no need extract features from raw signals. The deep 
      network architecture has the ability of automatic feature learning, and the learned 
      features are the higher-level abstract description of low-level raw physiological 
      signals. Eight-nine middle-aged and elderly subjects were enrolled to evaluate the 
      performance of the proposed BP estimation method, with oscillometric technique-based 
      BP as a reference. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method had a 
      commendable accuracy in BP estimation, with a correlation coefficient of 0.91 and an 
      estimation error of -2.06 ± 6.89 mmHg for systolic BP, and 0.89 and -4.66 ± 4.91 
      mmHg for diastolic BP. This study shows that the proposed method provided a 
      potential novel insight for the cuff-less BP estimation.

      cardiopulmonary arrests. DESIGN: Retrospective, observational study. SETTING: 
      Tertiary children's hospital 21-bed cardiovascular ICU and 36-bed step-down unit. 
      PATIENTS: Twenty single ventricle infants who received stage 1 palliation surgery 
      between January 2013 and January 2014. Twenty rapid response events resulting in 
      cardiopulmonary arrests (arrest group) were recorded in 13 subjects, and nine 
      subjects had no interstage cardiopulmonary arrest (control group). INTERVENTIONS: 
      None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Arrest data were collected over the 4-hour time 
      window prior to cardiopulmonary arrest. Control data were collected from subjects 
      with no interstage arrest using the 4-hour time window prior to cardiovascular ICU 
      discharge. A paired subgroup analysis was performed comparing subject 4-hour windows 
      prior to arrest (prearrest group) with 4-hour windows prior to discharge (postarrest 
      group). Raw values of ST segments were compared between groups. A 3D ST-segment 
      vector was created using three quasi-orthogonal leads (II, aVL, and V5). Magnitude 
      and instability of this continuous vector were compared between groups. There was no 
      significant difference in mean unprocessed ST-segment values in the arrest and 
      control groups. Utilizing signal processing, there was an increase in the ST-vector 
      magnitude (p = 0.02) and instability (p = 0.008) in the arrest group. In the paired 
      subgroup analysis, there was an increase in the ST-vector magnitude (p = 0.05) and 
      instability (p = 0.05) in the prearrest state compared with the postarrest state 
      prior to discharge. CONCLUSIONS: In single ventricle patients, increased ST 
      instability and magnitude were associated with rapid response events that required 
      intervention for cardiopulmonary arrest, whereas conventional ST-segment monitoring 
      did not differentiate an arrest from control state.

AB  - The computer-aided interpretation of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals provides a 
      non-invasive and inexpensive technique for analyzing heart activity under various 
      cardiac conditions. Further, the proliferation of smartphones and wireless networks 
      makes it possible to perform continuous Holter monitoring. However, although 
      considerable attention has been paid to automated detection and classification of 
      heartbeats from ECG data, classifier learning strategies have never been used to 
      deal with individual variations in cardiac activity. In this paper, we propose a 
      novel method for automatic classification of an individual׳s ECG beats for Holter 
      monitoring. We use the Pan-Tompkins algorithm to accurately extract features such as 
      the QRS complex and P wave, and employ a decision tree to classify each beat in 
      terms of these features. Evaluations conducted against the MIT-BIH arrhythmia 
      database before and after personalization of the decision tree using a patient׳s own 
      ECG data yield heartbeat classification accuracies of 94.6% and 99%, respectively. 
      These are comparable to results obtained from state-of-the-art schemes, validating 
      the efficacy of our proposed method.

TI  - Modified automatic R-peak detection algorithm for patients with epilepsy using a 
      portable electrocardiogram recorder.
PG  - 4082-4085
LID - 10.1109/EMBC.2017.8037753 [doi]
AB  - Earlier studies have shown that short term heart rate variability (HRV) analysis of 
      ECG seems promising for detection of epileptic seizures. A precise and accurate 
      automatic R-peak detection algorithm is a necessity in a real-time, continuous 
      measurement of HRV, in a portable ECG device. We used the portable CE marked ePatch® 
      heart monitor to record the ECG of 14 patients, who were enrolled in the videoEEG 
      long term monitoring unit for clinical workup of epilepsy. Recordings of the first 7 
      patients were used as training set of data for the R-peak detection algorithm and 
      the recordings of the last 7 patients (467.6 recording hours) were used to test the 
      performance of the algorithm. We aimed to modify an existing QRS-detection algorithm 
      to a more precise R-peak detection algorithm to avoid the possible jitter Qand 
      S-peaks can create in the tachogram, which causes error in short-term HRVanalysis. 
      The proposed R-peak detection algorithm showed a high sensitivity (Se = 99.979%) and 
      positive predictive value (P+ = 99.976%), which was comparable with a previously 
      published QRS-detection algorithm for the ePatch® ECG device, when testing the same 
      dataset. The novel R-peak detection algorithm designed to avoid jitter has very high 
      sensitivity and specificity and thus is a suitable tool for a robust, fast, 
      real-time HRV-analysis in patients with epilepsy, creating the possibility for 
      real-time seizure detection for these patients.

TI  - Electrical And Hemodynamic Evalution Of Ventricular And Supraventricular 
      Tachycardias With An Implantable Dual-Chamber Pacemaker.
PG  - 1075
LID - 10.4022/jafib.1075 [doi]
LID - 1075
AB  - The discrimination between ventricular (VT) and supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) 
      and the evaluation of their hemodynamic impact are essential issues in the 
      arrhythmia management. A new pacing device features a tachycardia diagnostic system 
      relying on simultaneous recording of the transvalvular impedance (TVI) and a special 
      integrated electric signal derived by the whole set of endocardial electrodes 
      (iECG). The iECG waveform is sensitive to the pattern of ventricular activation, 
      similarly to the surface ECG. The TVI increases in systole and decreases in diastole 
      and the amplitude of this cyclic fluctuation is an expression of the effectiveness 
      of the pump function. In order to test the value of these signals in the analysis of 
      a tachycardia, we have assessed the iECG and TVI modifications induced by different 
      SVTs and tolerated and non-tolerated VTs, during electrophysiological (EP) studies. 
      In case of SVT, the ventricular component of the iECG maintained the same morphology 
      as in sinus rhythm. The peak-peak amplitude of the TVI fluctuation was reduced to 66 
      ± 11 % of the individual sinus rhythm reference, but the signal was present at every 
      beat and showed a remarkable stability (variation coefficient 0.19 ± 0.01). In case 
      of VT, the ventricular component of the iECG was strikingly different than in sinus 
      rhythm. Regular TVI fluctuation was observed with tolerated VTs (peak-peak amplitude 
      74 ± 6 %; variation coefficient 0.21 ± 0.04). In contrast, with non-tolerated VTs 
      the TVI amplitude was depressed below 40%, and the signal was virtually absent in 
      the event of very fast VT or VF. Our results confirm that the iECG is a reliable 
      tool to quickly discriminate VTs from SVTs and that TVI can provide information on 
      the severity of the hemodynamic impairment produced by a tachycardia, with potential 
      clinical benefit in the follow-up of pacemaker patients. Furthermore, the 
      application of these signals to automatic algorithms of arrhythmia recognition might 
      improve the specificity of therapy administration by an implantable defibrillator 
      (ICD).

TI  - Assessing ECG signal quality indices to discriminate ECGs with artefacts from 
      pathologically different arrhythmic ECGs.
PG  - 1370-82
LID - 10.1088/0967-3334/37/8/1370 [doi]
AB  - False and non-actionable alarms in critical care can be reduced by developing 
      algorithms which assess the trueness of an arrhythmia alarm from a bedside monitor. 
      Computational approaches that automatically identify artefacts in ECG signals are an 
      important branch of physiological signal processing which tries to address this 
      issue. Signal quality indices (SQIs) derived considering differences between 
      artefacts which occur in ECG signals and normal QRS morphology have the potential to 
      discriminate pathologically different arrhythmic ECG segments as artefacts. Using 
      ECG signals from the PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2015 training set, 
      we studied previously reported ECG SQIs in the scientific literature to 
      differentiate ECG segments with artefacts from arrhythmic ECG segments. We found 
      that the ability of SQIs to discriminate between ECG artefacts and arrhythmic ECG 
      varies based on arrhythmia type since the pathology of each arrhythmic ECG waveform 
      is different. Therefore, to reduce the risk of SQIs classifying arrhythmic events as 
      noise it is important to validate and test SQIs with databases that include 
      arrhythmias. Arrhythmia specific SQIs may also minimize the risk of misclassifying 
      arrhythmic events as noise.

      recordings.
PG  - 1917-28
LID - 10.1007/s10439-012-0551-2 [doi]
AB  - This paper presents a novel method for automatic identification of motion artifact 
      beats in ECG recordings. The proposed method is based on the ECG complexes 
      clustering, fuzzy logic and multi-parameters decision. Firstly, eight simulated 
      datasets with different signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) were built for identification 
      experiments. Results show that the identification sensitivity of our method is 
      sensitive to SNR levels and acts like a low-pass filter that matches the 
      cardiologists' recognition, while the Norm FP rate and PVB FP rate keep 
      significantly low regardless of SNR. Furthermore, a simulated dataset including 
      random durations of motion activities superimposed segments and two clinical 
      datasets acquired from two different commercial recorders were adopted for the 
      evaluation of accuracy and robustness. The overall identification results on these 
      datasets were: sensitivity >94.69%, Norm FP rate <0.60% and PVB FP rate <2.65%. All 
      the results were obtained without any manual threshold adjustment according to the 
      priori information, thus dissolving the drawbacks of previous published methods. 
      Additionally, the total cost time of our method applied to 24 h recordings is less 
      than 1 s, which is extremely suitable in the situation of magnanimity data in 
      long-term ECG recordings.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: ECG is one of the biometric signals that has been studied 
      in peer-reviewed over past years. The developments on the signal analysis methods 
      show that the studies on the ECG would continue unabatedly. It has a common use on 
      cardiac diseases with high rates of classification performances by integrating it 
      with signal analysis methods. The aim of the study is to utilize the ECG for human 
      identification. METHODS: Second Order Difference Plot (SODP) is a non-linear 
      time-series analysis method that allows determining the features using the 
      statistical analysis of the wave distributions. The SODP features were extracted 
      using different quantification methods for ECG-based human identification. A new 
      quantification approach has been proposed on the SODP for ECG-based human 
      identification. The proposed method, Logarithmic Grid Analysis, was compared with 
      the existing quantification methods on the SODP. The region of the SODP was divided 
      into sub-regions with logarithmically increasing distances and the numbers of data 
      points in each logarithmic sub regions were calculated in the proposed method. Three 
      different databases were used to test the validity of the method. These records have 
      been tested with the conventional feature extraction methods on the SODP. The 
      long-term ECG signals were divided into 5-s short-term ECG signals. RESULTS: The 
      Logarithmic Grid Analysis features that were counted from short-time ECG signals 
      were classified with k-Nearest Neighbor algorithm using 10-fold cross validation, 
      and the identification performance of the proposed model was evaluated. 
      Consequently, high accuracy rates of 91.96%, 99.86% and 95.12% were achieved on 
      ECG-based human identification using the Logarithmic Grid Analysis method on the 
      SODP. CONCLUSIONS: The density score of data points at the center of the SODP is too 
      high. This case increases the importance of the regions close the center in order to 
      find the detailed and significant features from the SODP. The number of data points 
      at the center has been extracted in more detail and the vertex areas of the major 
      axes of the SODP can be interpreted in the aggregate sub-regions by using 
      logarithmically increasing distances with a small number of feature size.

TI  - Analysis of the ST-T complex of the electrocardiogram using the Karhunen--Loève 
      transform: adaptive monitoring and alternans detection.
PG  - 175-89
AB  - The Karhunen-Loève transform (KLT) is applied to study the ventricular 
      repolarisation period as reflected in the ST-T complex of the surface ECG. The KLT 
      coefficients provide a sensitive means of quantitating ST-T shapes. A training set 
      of ST-T complexes is used to derive a set of KLT basis vectors that permits 
      representation of 90% of the signal energy using four KLT coefficients. As a 
      truncated KLT expansion tends to favor representation of the signal over any 
      additive noise, a time series of KLT coefficients obtained from successive ST-T 
      complexes is better suited for representation of both medium-term variations (such 
      as ischemic changes) and short-term variations (such as ST-T alternans) than 
      discrete parameters such as the ST level or other local indices. For analysis of 
      ischemic changes, an adaptive filter is described that can be used to estimate the 
      KLT coefficient, yielding an increase in the signal-to-noise ratio of 10 dB (u = 
      0.1), with a convergence time of about three beats. A beat spectrum of the 
      unfiltered KLT coefficient series is used for detection of ST-T alterans. These 
      methods are illustrated with examples from the European ST-T Database. About 20% of 
      records revealed quasi-periodic salvos of ischemic ST-T change episodes and another 
      20% exhibit repetitive, but not clearly periodic patterns of ST-T change episodes. 
      About 5% of ischemic episodes were associated with ST-T alterans.

TI  - Computer-based rhythm diagnosis and its possible influence on nonexpert 
      electrocardiogram readers.
PG  - 18-22
LID - 10.1016/j.jelectrocard.2011.05.007 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Systems providing computer-based analysis of the resting 
      electrocardiogram (ECG) seek to improve the quality of health care by providing 
      accurate and timely automatic diagnosis of, for example, cardiac rhythm to 
      clinicians. The accuracy of these diagnoses, however, remains questionable. 
      OBJECTIVES: We tested the hypothesis that (a) 2 independent automated ECG systems 
      have better accuracy in rhythm diagnosis than nonexpert clinicians and (b) both 
      systems provide correct diagnostic suggestions in a large percentage of cases where 
      the diagnosis of nonexpert clinicians is incorrect. METHODS: Five hundred ECGs were 
      manually analyzed by 2 senior experts, 3 nonexpert clinicians, and automatically by 
      2 automated systems. The accuracy of the nonexpert rhythm statements was compared 
      with the accuracy of each system statement. The proportion of rhythm statements when 
      the clinician's diagnoses were incorrect and the systems instead provided correct 
      diagnosis was assessed. RESULTS: A total of 420 sinus rhythms and 156 rhythm 
      disturbances were recognized by expert reading. Significance of the difference in 
      accuracy between nonexperts and systems was P = .45 for system A and P = .11 for 
      system B. The percentage of correct automated diagnoses in cases when the clinician 
      was incorrect was 28% ± 10% for system A and 25% ± 11% for system B (P = .09). 
      CONCLUSION: The rhythm diagnoses of automated systems did not reach better average 
      accuracy than those of nonexpert readings. The computer diagnosis of rhythm can be 
      incorrect in cases where the clinicians fail in reaching the correct ECG diagnosis.

TI  - Characterization and classification of patients with different levels of cardiac 
      death risk by using Poincaré plot analysis.
PG  - 1332-1335
LID - 10.1109/EMBC.2017.8037078 [doi]
AB  - Cardiac death risk is still a big problem by an important part of the population, 
      especially in elderly patients. In this study, we propose to characterize and 
      analyze the cardiovascular and cardiorespiratory systems using the Poincaré plot. A 
      total of 46 cardiomyopathy patients and 36 healthy subjets were analyzed. Left 
      ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was used to stratify patients with low risk 
      (LR: LVEF > 35%, 16 patients), and high risk (HR: LVEF ≤ 35%, 30 patients) of heart 
      attack. RR, SBP and T(Tot) time series were extracted from the ECG, blood pressure 
      and respiratory flow signals, respectively. Parameters that describe the 
      scatterplott of Poincaré method, related to short- and long-term variabilities, 
      acceleration and deceleration of the dynamic system, and the complex correlation 
      index were extracted. The linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and the support vector 
      machines (SVM) classification methods were used to analyze the results of the 
      extracted parameters. The results showed that cardiac parameters were the best to 
      discriminate between HR and LR groups, especially the complex correlation index (p = 
      0.009). Analising the interaction, the best result was obtained with the relation 
      between the difference of the standard deviation of the cardiac and respiratory 
      system (p = 0.003). When comparing HR vs LR groups, the best classification was 
      obtained applying SVM method, using an ANOVA kernel, with an accuracy of 98.12%. An 
      accuracy of 97.01% was obtained by comparing patients versus healthy, with a SVM 
      classifier and Laplacian kernel. The morphology of Poincaré plot introduces 
      parameters that allow the characterization of the cardiorespiratory system dynamics.

TI  - An artificial vector model for generating abnormal electrocardiographic rhythms.
PG  - 595-609
LID - 10.1088/0967-3334/31/5/001 [doi]
AB  - We present generalizations of our previously published artificial models for 
      generating multi-channel ECG to provide simulations of abnormal cardiac rhythms. 
      Using a three-dimensional vectorcardiogram (VCG) formulation, we generate the normal 
      cardiac dipole for a patient using a sum of Gaussian kernels, fitted to real VCG 
      recordings. Abnormal beats are specified either as perturbations to the normal 
      dipole or as new dipole trajectories. Switching between normal and abnormal beat 
      types is achieved using a first-order Markov chain. Probability transitions can be 
      learned from real data or modeled by coupling to heart rate and sympathovagal 
      balance. Natural morphology changes from beat-to-beat are incorporated by varying 
      the angular frequency of the dipole as a function of the inter-beat (RR) interval. 
      The RR interval time series is generated using our previously described model 
      whereby time- and frequency-domain heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability 
      characteristics can be specified. QT-HR hysteresis is simulated by coupling the 
      Gaussian kernels associated with the T-wave in the model with a nonlinear factor 
      related to the local HR (determined from the last n RR intervals). Morphology 
      changes due to respiration are simulated by introducing a rotation matrix couple to 
      the respiratory frequency. We demonstrate an example of the use of this model by 
      simulating HR-dependent T-wave alternans (TWA) with and without phase-switching due 
      to ectopy. Application of our model also reveals previously unreported effects of 
      common TWA estimation methods.

TI  - Development and validation of a risk score to predict QT interval prolongation in 
      hospitalized patients.
PG  - 479-87
LID - 10.1161/CIRCOUTCOMES.113.000152 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Identifying hospitalized patients at risk for QT interval prolongation 
      could lead to interventions to reduce the risk of torsades de pointes. Our objective 
      was to develop and validate a risk score for QT prolongation in hospitalized 
      patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this study, in a single tertiary care institution, 
      consecutive patients (n=900) admitted to cardiac care units comprised the risk score 
      development group. The score was then applied to 300 additional patients in a 
      validation group. Corrected QT (QTc) interval prolongation (defined as QTc>500 ms or 
      an increase of >60 ms from baseline) occurred in 274 (30.4%) and 90 (30.0%) patients 
      in the development group and validation group, respectively. Independent predictors 
      of QTc prolongation included the following: female (odds ratio, 1.5; 95% confidence 
      interval, 1.1-2.0), diagnosis of myocardial infarction (2.4 [1.6-3.9]), septic shock 
      (2.7 [1.5-4.8]), left ventricular dysfunction (2.7 [1.6-5.0]), administration of a 
      QT-prolonging drug (2.8 [2.0-4.0]), ≥2 QT-prolonging drugs (2.6 [1.9-5.6]), or loop 
      diuretic (1.4 [1.0-2.0]), age >68 years (1.3 [1.0-1.9]), serum K⁺ <3.5 mEq/L (2.1 
      [1.5-2.9]), and admitting QTc >450 ms (2.3; confidence interval [1.6-3.2]). Risk 
      scores were developed by assigning points based on log odds ratios. Low-, moderate-, 
      and high-risk ranges of 0 to 6, 7 to 10, and 11 to 21 points, respectively, best 
      predicted QTc prolongation (C statistic=0.823). A high-risk score ≥11 was associated 
      with sensitivity=0.74, specificity=0.77, positive predictive value=0.79, and 
      negative predictive value=0.76. In the validation group, the incidences of QTc 
      prolongation were 15% (low risk); 37% (moderate risk); and 73% (high risk). 
      CONCLUSIONS: A risk score using easily obtainable clinical variables predicts 
      patients at highest risk for QTc interval prolongation and may be useful in guiding 
      monitoring and treatment decisions.

TI  - Evaluation of cardiac autonomic function using heart rate variability in children 
      with acute carbon monoxide poisoning.
PG  - 1662-1669

AB  - Introduction Carbon monoxide poisoning may cause myocardial toxicity and cardiac 
      autonomic dysfunction, which may contribute to the development of life-threatening 
      arrhythmias. We investigated the potential association between acute carbon monoxide 
      exposure and cardiac autonomic function measured by heart rate variability. METHOD: 
      The present study included 40 children aged 1-17 years who were admitted to the 
      Pediatric Intensive Care Unit with acute carbon monoxide poisoning and 40 healthy 
      age- and sex-matched controls. Carboxyhaemoglobin and cardiac enzymes were measured 
      at admission. Electrocardiography was performed on admission and discharge, and 
      24-hour Holter electrocardiography was digitally recorded. Heart rate variability 
      was analysed at both time points - 24-hour recordings - and frequency domains - from 
      the first 5 minutes of intensive care unit admission. RESULTS: Time domain and 
      frequency indices such as high-frequency spectral power and low-frequency spectral 
      power were similar between patient and control groups (p>0.05). The ratio of 
      low-frequency spectral power to high-frequency spectral power was significantly 
      lower in the carbon monoxide poisoning group (p<0.001) and was negatively correlated 
      with carboxyhaemoglobin levels (r=-0.351, p<0.05). The mean heart rate, QT 
      dispersion, corrected QT dispersion, and P dispersion values were higher in the 
      carbon monoxide poisoning group (p<0.05) on admission. The QT dispersion and 
      corrected QT dispersion remained longer in the carbon monoxide poisoning group 
      compared with controls on discharge (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: The frequency domain 
      indices, especially the ratio of low-frequency spectral power to high-frequency 
      spectral power, are useful for the evaluation of the cardiac autonomic function. The 
      decreased low-frequency spectral power-to-high-frequency spectral power ratio 
      reflects a balance of the autonomic nervous system, which shifted to parasympathetic 
      components.

TI  - Automated assessment of cardiac autonomic function by means of deceleration capacity 
      from noisy, nonstationary ECG signals: validation study.
PG  - 122-8
LID - 10.1111/anec.12107 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Assessment of heart rate variability by means of deceleration capacity 
      (DC) provides a noninvasive probe of cardiac autonomic activity. However, clinical 
      use of DC is limited by the need of manual review of the ECG signals to eliminate 
      artifacts, noise, and nonstationarities. OBJECTIVE: To validate a novel approach to 
      fully automatically assess DC from noisy, nonstationary signals METHODS: We analyzed 
      100 randomly selected ECG tracings recorded for 10 minutes by routine monitor 
      devices (GE DASH 4000, sample size 100 Hz) in a medical emergency department. We 
      used a novel automated R-peak detection algorithm, which is mainly based on a 
      Shannon energy envelope estimator and a Hilbert transformation. We transformed the 
      automatically generated RR interval time series by phase-rectified signal averaging 
      (PRSA) to assess DC of heart rate (DCauto ). DCauto was compared to DCmanual , which 
      was obtained from the same manually preprocessed ECG signals. RESULTS: DCauto and 
      DCmanual showed good correlation and agreement, particularly if a low-pass filter 
      was implemented into the PRSA algorithm. Correlation coefficient between DCauto and 
      DCmanual was 0.983 (P < 0.0001). Average difference between DCauto and DCmanual was 
      -0.23±0.49 ms with limits of agreement ranging from -1.19 to 0.73 ms. Significantly 
      lower correlations were observed when a different R-peak detection algorithm or 
      conventional heart rate variability (HRV) measures were tested. CONCLUSIONS: DC can 
      be fully automatically assessed from noisy, nonstationary ECG signals.

TI  - Automated detection of left ventricular dyskinesis by gated blood pool SPECT.
PG  - 881-8
LID - 10.1097/MNM.0b013e32833d82ff [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The ability to detect left ventricular (LV) apical dyskinesis, the 
      hallmark of an aneurysm, is an important requirement of diagnostic cardiac imaging 
      modalities that perform wall motion analysis. Our investigation assessed the ability 
      of gated blood pool single-photon emission-computed tomography (GBPS) to 
      automatically detect LV dyskinesis, using cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) as the 
      reference standard. MATERIALS AND METHODS: GBPS data were analyzed for 41 patients 
      with congestive heart failure or cardiomyopathy and compared with ECG-gated TrueFISP 
      CMR evaluations. An experienced nuclear cardiologist without the knowledge of 
      quantitative GBPS or CMR results graded visual impressions of regional wall motion 
      while examining cinematic playbacks of GBPS images. GBPS algorithms automatically 
      isolated LV counts and computed regional phase (phi) values in each of 17 
      conventional American Heart Association LV segments. LV asynchrony was quantified by 
      the two local measures: maximum apical phi difference (Deltaalpha), and standard 
      deviation among apical phases (sigmaalpha), and by the five global measures: varphi 
      histogram bandwidth (BWHistogram), phi histogram standard deviation 
      (sigmaHistogram), Z-scores, Entropy, and Synchrony. For CMR data, an expert manually 
      drew endocardial LV outlines to measure regional wall motion in 17 LV segments. 
      RESULTS: Apical dyskinesis was present in nine patients. Among GBPS measurements, 
      the method with the greatest accuracy for detecting dyskinesis was Deltaalpha 
      (receiver operating characteristic area=95%). The only method with a sufficiently 
      high kappa statistic to represent 'very good agreement' with CMR was Deltaalpha, 
      with kappa=0.81. Deltaalpha was more sensitive in detecting dyskinesis than visual 
      analysis (100 vs. 33%, P=0.01). CONCLUSION: Automatic GBPS computations accurately 
      identified patients with LV dyskinesis, and detected dyskinesis more successfully 
      than did visual analysis.

TI  - [Electrocardiographic abnormalities in acute olanzapine poisonings].
PG  - 422-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: Olanzapine is an atypical antipsychotic used for many years in the 
      treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Poisonings with this medicine can 
      results with cardiotoxic effects in the form of ECG abnormalities. AIM OF THE STUDY: 
      To evaluate the nature and incidence of electrocardiographic abnormalities in 
      patients with acute olanzapine poisoning. MATERIAL: 23 adult (mean age 38.4 +/- 15.5 
      years) patients with acute olanzapine poisoning, including 10 men (30.4 +/- 8.1 
      years) and 11 women (45.7 +/- 17.2 years), where 1 man and 1 woman were poisoned 
      twice. The toxic serum level of olanzapine (above 100 ng/mL) was confirmed in each 
      patient. METHODS: Evaluation of electrocardiograms performed in patients in the 
      first day of hospitalization with automatic measurement of durations of PQ, QRS and 
      QTc and the identification of arrhythmias and conduction disorders on the basis of 
      visual analysis of the ECG waveforms. Statistical analysis of the results using the 
      methods of descriptive statistics. RESULTS: The mean durations of PQ, QRS and QTc in 
      the study group were as follows: 135 +/- 23 ms, 91 +/- 12 ms, and 453 +/- 48 ms, 
      respectively. The most common ECG abnormalities were prolonged QTc and 
      supraventricular tachycardia (including sinus tachycardia) - each 22%; less common 
      were ST-T changes (17%) and supraventricular premature complexes (9%), and only in 
      individual cases (4%) ventricular premature complexes, bundle branch block, sinus 
      bradycardia and atrial fibrillation were present. CONCLUSIONS: In the course of 
      acute olanzapine poisonings: (1) prolonged QTc interval is quite common, but rarely 
      leads to torsade de pointes tachycardia; (2) fast supraventricular rhythms are also 
      common, but rarely cause irregular tachyarrhythmias, eg. atrial fibrillation; (3) 
      conduction disorders (atrioventricular blocks, bundle branch blocks) are not typical 
      abnormalities; (4) the observed ECG abnormalities emphasize the need of continuous 
      ECG monitoring in these patients.

TI  - Quantitative evaluation of heartbeat interval time series using Poincaré analysis 
      reveals distinct patterns of heart rate dynamics during cycles of vagus nerve 
      stimulation in patients with heart failure.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Optimization of stimulation parameters is essential to maximizing 
      therapeutic efficacy and minimizing side effects. METHODS: The ANTHEM-HF study 
      enrolled patients with heart failure who received chronic autonomic regulation 
      therapy (ART) with an implantable vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) system on either the 
      right (n=30) or left side (n=29). Acute effects of continuously cycling VNS on R-R 
      interval dynamics were evaluated using post hoc Poincaré analysis of ECG recordings 
      collected during multiple titration sessions over an 8-12week period. During each 
      titration session, VNS intensity associated with maximum tolerable dose was 
      determined. Poincaré plots of R-R interval time series were created for epochs when 
      VNS cycled from OFF to ON at varying intensity levels. RESULTS: VNS produced an 
      immediate, relatively small change in beat-to-beat distribution of R-R intervals 
      during the 14-sec ON time, which was correlated with stimulation current amplitude 
      (r=0.85, p=0.05). During titration of right-sided stimulation, there was a strong 
      correlation (r=0.91, p=0.01) between stimulus intensity and the Poincaré parameter 
      of standard deviation, SD1, which is associated with high-frequency heart rate 
      variability. The effect of VNS on instantaneous heart rate was indicated by a shift 
      in the centroid of the beat-to-beat cloud distribution demarcated by the encircling 
      ellipse. As anticipated, left-sided stimulation did not alter any Poincaré parameter 
      except at high stimulation intensities (≥2mA). CONCLUSION: Quantitative Poincaré 
      analysis reveals a tight coupling in beat-to-beat dynamics during VNS ON cycles that 
      is directly related to stimulation intensity, providing a useful measurement for 
      confirming autonomic engagement.

TI  - A Novel Wavelet Transform-Homogeneity Model for Sudden Cardiac Death Prediction 
      Using ECG Signals.
PG  - 176
LID - 10.1007/s10916-018-1031-5 [doi]
AB  - Sudden cardiac death (SCD) is one of the main causes of death among people. A new 
      methodology is presented for predicting the SCD based on ECG signals employing the 
      wavelet packet transform (WPT), a signal processing technique, homogeneity index 
      (HI), a nonlinear measurement for time series signals, and the Enhanced 
      Probabilistic Neural Network classification algorithm. The effectiveness and 
      usefulness of the proposed method is evaluated using a database of measured ECG data 
      acquired from 20 SCD and 18 normal patients. The proposed methodology presents the 
      following significant advantages: (1) compared with previous works, the proposed 
      methodology achieves a higher accuracy using a single nonlinear feature, HI, thus 
      requiring low computational resource for predicting an SCD onset in real-time, 
      unlike other methodologies proposed in the literature where a large number of 
      nonlinear features are used to predict an SCD event; (2) it is capable of predicting 
      the risk of developing an SCD event up to 20 min prior to the onset with a high 
      accuracy of 95.8%, superseding the prior 12 min prediction time reported recently, 
      and (3) it uses the ECG signal directly without the need for transforming the signal 
      to a heart rate variability signal, thus saving time in the processing.

TI  - Impact of sedation and organ failure on continuous heart and respiratory rate 
      variability monitoring in critically ill patients: a pilot study.
PG  - 433-44

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Our aim is to better characterize the impact of sedation and its 
      interruption on continuously monitored heart rate variability and respiratory rate 
      variability in critically ill patients. We aim to explore whether sedation reduces 
      heart rate variability and respiratory rate variability in critically ill patients 
      and whether the extent of reduction depends on degree of organ dysfunction. DESIGN: 
      Prospective observational pilot study. SETTING: Intensive care unit in tertiary care 
      teaching hospital. PATIENTS: Thirty-three critically ill adult patients experiencing 
      respiratory and/or cardiac failure. INTERVENTIONS: Electrocardiogram and end-tidal 
      capnography waveform capture were initiated from admission or intubation, 
      respectively, and continued to intensive care unit discharge or a maximum of 14 d. 
      MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: All patient days with a sedation interruption 
      (defined as cessation of a continuous infusion of sedation agent) were identified. 
      Mean heart rate variability and respiratory rate variability were computed over two 
      periods: 4 hrs directly prior to the sedation interruption, and the duration of 
      sedation interruption (median: 1 hr 45 mins, interquartile range: 4 hrs 15 mins or 
      max 4 hrs). Severity of organ dysfunction was assessed through multiple organ 
      dysfunction syndrome scores, and sedative agents were recorded for each sedation 
      interruption. Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome levels were defined as low (0-2), 
      medium (3-4), and high (> 4). Variability before and during sedation interruption 
      was compared and analyzed across multiple organ dysfunction syndrome levels and 
      sedative types. Our results suggest that both heart rate variability and respiratory 
      rate variability increased during sedation interruption (p < 0.05 for coefficient of 
      variation). Patients with low and medium multiple organ dysfunction syndrome 
      experienced greater increase in heart rate variability during sedation interruption 
      (p < 0.05 for coefficient of variation), compared to patients with high multiple 
      organ dysfunction syndrome, who failed to mount a significant increase in heart rate 
      variability when sedation was stopped. Similarly, sedation interruption led to 
      increased respiratory rate variability for low multiple organ dysfunction syndrome 
      patients (p < 0.05 for SD), but in contrast, a further deterioration in respiratory 
      rate variability occurred in the high multiple organ dysfunction syndrome patients. 
      All trends persisted when controlling for sedative agents. CONCLUSIONS: Interruption 
      of sedation allows for uncovering a greater restoration of heart rate variability 
      and respiratory rate variability in patients with low organ failure. The further 
      reduction in respiratory variability during the elimination of sedation in patients 
      with high multiple organ dysfunction syndrome suggests a differential response and 
      benefit from sedation interruption, and merits further investigation. As reduced 
      variability correlates with severity of illness, and need for sedation depends on 
      organ failure, variability monitoring may offer a dynamic measure of a variable 
      response to the benefit, timing, and duration of sedation interruption.

TI  - A Deep Learning Method to Detect Atrial Fibrillation Based on Continuous Wavelet 
      Transform.
PG  - 1908-1912
LID - 10.1109/EMBC.2019.8856834 [doi]
AB  - Atrial fibrillation (AF) is one of the most common arrhythmias. The automatic AF 
      detection is of great clinical significance but at the same time it remains a big 
      problem to researchers. In this study, a novel deep learning method to detect AF was 
      proposed. For a 10 s length single lead electrocardiogram (ECG) signal, the 
      continuous wavelet transform (CWT) was used to obtain the wavelet coefficient 
      matrix, and then a convolutional neural network (CNN) with a specific architecture 
      was trained to discriminate the rhythm of the signal. The ECG data in multiple 
      databases were divided into 4 classes according to the rhythm annotation: normal 
      sinus rhythm (NSR), atrial fibrillation (AF), other types of arrhythmia except AF 
      (OTHER), and noise signal (NOISE). The method was evaluated using three different 
      wavelet bases. The experiment showed promising results when using a Morlet wavelet, 
      with an overall accuracy of 97.56%, an average sensitivity of 97.56%, an average 
      specificity of 99.19%. Besides, the area under curve (AUC) value is 0.9983, which 
      showed that the proposed method was effective for detecting AF.

TI  - Classification of normal and arrhythmic ECG using wavelet transform based 
      template-matching technique.
PG  - 843-847
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To propose a wavelet-based template matching technique to extract 
      features for automatic classification of electrocardiogram signals of normal and 
      arrhythmic individuals. METHODS: The study was conducted from December 2014 to 
      December 2015 at the Department of Electrical Engineering, Institute of Space 
      Technology, Islamabad, Pakistan. Electrocardiogram signals analysed in this study 
      were taken from the freely available database www.physionet.org. The data for normal 
      subjects was taken from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology-Beth Israel 
      Hospital's normal sinus rhythm database and data for diseased subjects was taken 
      from the arrhythmia database. RESULTS: Of the 30 subjects, there were 15(50%) normal 
      and 15(50%) diseased subjects. The group-averaged phase difference indices of 
      arrhythmic subjects were significantly larger than that of normal individuals 
      (p<0.05) within the frequency range of 0.9-1.1 Hz. Moreover, the scatter plot 
      between the phase difference index and magnitude of wavelet cross-spectrum for 
      frequency range of 0.9-1.1 Hz demonstrated a satisfactory delineation between normal 
      and arrhythmic individuals. CONCLUSIONS: Wavelet decomposition-based template 
      matching technique achieved satisfactory delineation of normal and arrhythmic 
      electrocardiogram dynamics.

TI  - Left Ventricular Diastolic Dysfunction in a Rat Model of Diabetic Cardiomyopathy 
      using ECG-gated (18)F-FDG PET.
PG  - 17631

LID - 17631
AB  - In diabetic cardiomyopathy, left ventricular (LV) diastolic dysfunction is one of 
      the earliest signs of cardiac involvement prior to the definitive development of 
      heart failure (HF). We aimed to explore the LV diastolic function using 
      electrocardiography (ECG)-gated (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission 
      tomography ((18)F-FDG PET) imaging beyond the assessment of cardiac glucose 
      utilization in a diabetic rat model. ECG-gated (18)F-FDG PET imaging was performed 
      in a rat model of type 2 diabetes (ZDF fa/fa) and ZL control rats at age of 13 weeks 
      (n = 6, respectively). Under hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp to enhance cardiac 
      activity, (18)F-FDG was administered and subsequently, list-mode imaging using a 
      dedicated small animal PET system with ECG signal recording was performed. List-mode 
      data were sorted and reconstructed into tomographic images of 16 frames per cardiac 
      cycle. Left ventricular functional parameters (systolic: LV ejection fraction (EF), 
      heart rate (HR) vs. diastolic: peak filling rate (PFR)) were obtained using an 
      automatic ventricular edge detection software. No significant difference in systolic 
      function could be obtained (ZL controls vs. ZDF rats: LVEF, 62.5 ± 4.2 vs. 
      59.4 ± 4.5%; HR: 331 ± 35 vs. 309 ± 24 bpm; n.s., respectively). On the contrary, 
      ECG-gated PET imaging showed a mild but significant decrease of PFR in the diabetic 
      rats (ZL controls vs. ZDF rats: 12.1 ± 0.8 vs. 10.2 ± 1 Enddiastolic Volume/sec, 
      P < 0.01). Investigating a diabetic rat model, ECG-gated (18)F-FDG PET imaging 
      detected LV diastolic dysfunction while systolic function was still preserved. This 
      might open avenues for an early detection of HF onset in high-risk type 2 diabetes 
      before cardiac symptoms become apparent.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The mechanisms whereby aerobic training reduces the occurrence of sudden 
      cardiac death in humans are not clear. We test the hypothesis that exercise-induced 
      increased resistance to ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation (VT/VF) involve an 
      intrinsic remodeling in healthy hearts. METHODS AND RESULTS: Thirty rats were 
      divided into a sedentary (CTRL, n = 16) and two exercise groups: short- (4 weeks, 
      ST, n = 7) and long-term (8 weeks, LT, n = 7) trained groups. Following the exercise 
      program hearts were isolated and studied in a Langendorff perfusion system. An S1-S2 
      pacing protocol was applied at the right ventricle to determine inducibility of 
      VT/VF. Fast Fourier transforms were applied on ECG time-series. In-vivo measurements 
      showed training-induced increase in aerobic capacity, heart-to-body weight ratio and 
      a 50% low-to-high frequency ratio reduction in the heart rate variability (p<0.05). 
      In isolated hearts the probability for VF decreased from 26.1±14.4 in CTRL to 
      13.9±14.1 and 6.7±8.5% in the ST and LT, respectively (p<0.05). Duration of VF also 
      decreased from 19.0±5.7 in CTRL to 8.8±7.1 and 6.0±5.8 sec in ST and LT respectively 
      (p<0.05). Moreover, the pacing current required for VF induction increased following 
      exercise (2.9±1.7 vs. 5.4±2.1 and 8.5±0.9 mA, respectively; p<0.05). Frequency 
      analysis of ECG revealed an exercise-induced VF transition from a narrow single peak 
      spectrum at 17 Hz in CTRL to a broader range of peaks ranging between 8.8 and 22.5 
      Hz in the LT group (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: Exercise in rats leads to reduced VF 
      propensity associated with an intrinsic cardiac remodeling related to a broader 
      spectral range and faster frequency components in the ECG.

AB  - Although electrical impedance tomography (EIT) for ventilation monitoring is on the 
      verge of clinical trials, pulmonary perfusion imaging with EIT remains a challenge, 
      especially in spontaneously breathing subjects. In anticipation of more research on 
      this subject, we believe a thorough review is called for. In this paper, findings 
      related to the physiological origins and electrical characteristics of this signal 
      are summarized, highlighting properties that are particularly relevant to EIT. The 
      perfusion impedance change signal is significantly smaller in amplitude compared 
      with the changes due to ventilation. Therefore, the hardware used for this purpose 
      must be more sensitive and more resilient to noise. In previous works, some signal- 
      or image-processing methods have been required to separate these two signals. Three 
      different techniques are reviewed in this paper, including the ECG-gating method, 
      frequency-domain-filtering-based methods and a principal-component-analysis-based 
      method. In addition, we review a number of experimental studies on both human and 
      animal subjects that employed EIT for perfusion imaging, with promising results in 
      the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE) and pulmonary arterial hypertension as well 
      as other potential applications. In our opinion, PE is most likely to become the 
      main focus for perfusion EIT in the future, especially for heavily instrumented 
      patients in the intensive care unit (ICU).

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The authors' primary objective was to test the hypothesis that Cerebral 
      State Index (CSI)-guided control of anesthetic depth might reduce the consumption of 
      anesthetics and shorten the duration of ICU and hospital stays after surgical 
      correction of combined valve disorders. DESIGN: Single center, randomized trial. 
      SETTING: City Hospital Number 1 of Arkhangelsk, Russian Federation. PARTICIPANTS: 
      Fifty adult patients with combined valve disorders requiring surgical correction. 
      INTERVENTIONS: The patients were randomized into 2 groups. In the CSI group, 
      anesthetic depth was monitored, and the rate of infusion of propofol was titrated to 
      maintain the depth of anesthesia corresponding to a CSI of 40-60. In the control 
      group, the depth of anesthesia was monitored clinically, and the dosage of propofol 
      was administered according to the recommendations of the manufacturer. MEASUREMENTS 
      AND MAIN RESULTS: All patients received standard perioperative monitoring. 
      Consumption of anesthetics and length of ICU and hospital stays were recorded. 
      Preoperative patient characteristics did not differ significantly between the 
      groups. In the CSI group, average intraoperative doses of midazolam and propofol 
      were reduced by 41% and 19%, respectively (p<0.01). Maintenance of anesthesia guided 
      by CSI shortened the time until fit for ICU discharge by 50% and reduced the lengths 
      of ICU and postoperative hospital stays by 35% and 25%, respectively (p< 0.05). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Monitoring of anesthetic depth reduces the requirements for midazolam 
      and propofol, resulting in a faster recovery and a shorter postoperative ICU and 
      hospital stay after surgical correction of combined valve disorders.

AB  - This work focuses on finding the most discriminatory or representative features that 
      allow to classify commercials according to negative, neutral and positive 
      effectiveness based on the Ace Score index. For this purpose, an experiment 
      involving forty-seven participants was carried out. In this experiment 
      electroencephalography (EEG), electrocardiography (ECG), Galvanic Skin Response 
      (GSR) and respiration data were acquired while subjects were watching a 30-min 
      audiovisual content. This content was composed by a submarine documentary and nine 
      commercials (one of them the ad under evaluation). After the signal pre-processing, 
      four sets of features were extracted from the physiological signals using different 
      state-of-the-art metrics. These features computed in time and frequency domains are 
      the inputs to several basic and advanced classifiers. An average of 89.76% of the 
      instances was correctly classified according to the Ace Score index. The best 
      results were obtained by a classifier consisting of a combination between AdaBoost 
      and Random Forest with automatic selection of features. The selected features were 
      those extracted from GSR and HRV signals. These results are promising in the 
      audiovisual content evaluation field by means of physiological signal processing.

TI  - [Analysis of heart rate variability].
PG  - 820-31
AB  - Heart rate variability (HRV) is a measure of the beat-to-beat variations in heart 
      rate. It is usually calculated by analyzing a time series of beat-to-beat intervals 
      from the ECG. Various measures of heart rate variability have been proposed, which 
      can be subdivided into time domain, frequency domain and non-linear measures. HRV is 
      regarded as an indicator of the activity of autonomic regulation of circulatory 
      function. HRV has considerable potential to assess the role of autonomic nervous 
      system fluctuations in normal healthy individuals, in patients with various 
      cardiovascular and noncardiovascular disorders and, in patients undergoing general 
      anesthesia. HRV studies should enhance our understanding of physiological phenomena, 
      perioperative cardiovascular changes, the actions of medications, and disease 
      mechanisms.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: With the emergence of long-term electrocardiogram (ECG) 
      recordings that extend several days beyond the typical 24-48 h, the development of 
      new tools to measure heart rate variability (HRV) and QT variability is needed to 
      utilize the full potential of such extra-long-term ECG recordings. METHODS: In this 
      report, we propose a new nonlinear time-frequency analysis approach, the 
      concentration of frequency and time (ConceFT), to study the HRV QT variability from 
      extra-long-term ECG recordings. This approach is a generalization of Short Time 
      Fourier Transform and Continuous Wavelet Transform approaches. RESULTS: As proof of 
      concept, we used 14-day ECG recordings to show that the ConceFT provides a sharpened 
      and stabilized spectrogram by taking the phase information of the time series and 
      the multitaper technique into account. CONCLUSION: The ConceFT has the potential to 
      provide a sharpened and stabilized spectrogram for the heart rate variability and QT 
      variability in 14-day ECG recordings.

TI  - Quantification of cardiorespiratory interactions based on joint symbolic dynamics.
PG  - 2604-14
LID - 10.1007/s10439-011-0332-3 [doi]
AB  - Cardiac and respiratory rhythms are highly nonlinear and nonstationary. As a result 
      traditional time-domain techniques are often inadequate to characterize their 
      complex dynamics. In this article, we introduce a novel technique to investigate the 
      interactions between R-R intervals and respiratory phases based on their joint 
      symbolic dynamics. To evaluate the technique, electrocardiograms (ECG) and 
      respiratory signals were recorded in 13 healthy subjects in different body postures 
      during spontaneous and controlled breathing. Herein, the R-R time series were 
      extracted from ECG and respiratory phases were obtained from abdomen impedance belts 
      using the Hilbert transform. Both time series were transformed into ternary symbol 
      vectors based on the changes between two successive R-R intervals or respiratory 
      phases. Subsequently, words of different symbol lengths were formed and the 
      correspondence between the two series of words was determined to quantify the 
      interaction between cardiac and respiratory cycles. To validate our results, 
      respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) was further studied using the phase-averaged 
      characterization of the RSA pattern. The percentage of similarity of the sequence of 
      symbols, between the respective words of the two series determined by joint symbolic 
      dynamics, was significantly reduced in the upright position compared to the supine 
      position (26.4 ± 4.7 vs. 20.5 ± 5.4%, p < 0.01). Similarly, RSA was also reduced 
      during upright posture, but the difference was less significant (0.11 ± 0.02 vs. 
      0.08 ± 0.01 s, p < 0.05). In conclusion, joint symbolic dynamics provides a new 
      efficient technique for the analysis of cardiorespiratory interaction that is highly 
      sensitive to the effects of orthostatic challenge.

AB  - Computerized interpretation of the electrocardiogram (ECG) began in the 1950s when 
      conversion of its analog signal to digital form became available. Since then, 
      automatic computer interpretations of the ECG have become routine, even at the point 
      of care, by the addition of interpretive algorithms to portable ECG carts. Now, more 
      than 100 million computerized ECG interpretations are recorded yearly in the United 
      States. These interpretations have contributed to medical care by reducing physician 
      reading time and accurately interpreting most normal ECGs. But errors do occur. The 
      computer cannot be held responsible for misinterpretations due to recording errors, 
      such as muscle artifacts or lead reversal. But, in many abnormal ECGs, the computer 
      makes its own errors-sometimes critical-in its incorrect detection of arrhythmias, 
      pacemakers, and myocardial infarctions. These errors require that all computerized 
      statements be over-read by trained physicians who have the advantage of clinical 
      context, unavailable to the computer. Together, the computer and over-readers now 
      provide the most accurate ECG interpretations available.

AB  - This paper proposes a method for the automatic classification of heartbeats in an 
      ECG signal. Since this task has specific characteristics such as time dependences 
      between observations and a strong class unbalance, a specific classifier is proposed 
      and evaluated on real ECG signals from the MIT arrhythmia database. This classifier 
      is a weighted variant of the conditional random fields classifier. Experiments show 
      that the proposed method outperforms previously reported heartbeat classification 
      methods, especially for the pathological heartbeats.

AB  - In industrialized countries with aging populations, heart failure affects 0.3-2% of 
      the general population. The investigation of 24 h-ECG recordings revealed the 
      potential of nonlinear indices of heart rate variability (HRV) for enhanced risk 
      stratification in patients with ischemic heart failure (IHF). However, long-term 
      analyses are time-consuming, expensive, and delay the initial diagnosis. The 
      objective of this study was to investigate whether 30 min short-term HRV analysis is 
      sufficient for comparable risk stratification in IHF in comparison to 24 h-HRV 
      analysis. From 256 IHF patients [221 at low risk (IHFLR) and 35 at high risk 
      (IHFHR)] (a) 24 h beat-to-beat time series (b) the first 30 min segment (c) the 30 
      min most stationary day segment and (d) the 30 min most stationary night segment 
      were investigated. We calculated linear (time and frequency domain) and nonlinear 
      HRV analysis indices. Optimal parameter sets for risk stratification in IHF were 
      determined for 24 h and for each 30 min segment by applying discriminant analysis on 
      significant clinical and non-clinical indices. Long- and short-term HRV indices from 
      frequency domain and particularly from nonlinear dynamics revealed high univariate 
      significances (p < 0.01) discriminating between IHFLR and IHFHR. For multivariate 
      risk stratification, optimal mixed parameter sets consisting of 5 indices (clinical 
      and nonlinear) achieved 80.4% AUC (area under the curve of receiver operating 
      characteristics) from 24 h HRV analysis, 84.3% AUC from first 30 min, 82.2 % AUC 
      from daytime 30 min and 81.7% AUC from nighttime 30 min. The optimal parameter set 
      obtained from the first 30 min showed nearly the same classification power when 
      compared to the optimal 24 h-parameter set. As results from stationary daytime and 
      nighttime, 30 min segments indicate that short-term analyses of 30 min may provide 
      at least a comparable risk stratification power in IHF in comparison to a 24 h 
      analysis period.

TI  - An Artificial Multi-Channel Model for Generating Abnormal Electrocardiographic 
      Rhythms.
PG  - 773-776
AB  - We present generalizations of our previously published artificial models for 
      generating multi-channel ECG so that the simulation of abnormal rhythms is possible. 
      Using a three-dimensional vectorcardiogram (VCG) formulation, we generate the normal 
      cardiac dipole for a patient using a sum of Gaussian kernels, fitted to real VCG 
      recordings. Abnormal beats are then specified either as new dipoles, or as 
      perturbations of the existing dipole. Switching between normal and abnormal beat 
      types is achieved using a hidden Markov model (HMM). Probability transitions can be 
      learned from real data or modeled by coupling to heart rate and sympathovagal 
      balance. Natural morphology changes form beat-to-beat are incorporated as before 
      from varying the angular frequency of the dipole as a function of the inter-beat 
      (RR) interval. The RR interval time series is generated using our previously 
      described model whereby time-and frequency-domain heart rate (HR) and heart rate 
      variability (HRV) characteristics can be specified. QT-HR hysteresis is simulated by 
      coupling the Gaussian kernels associated with the T-wave in the model with a 
      nonlinear factor related to the local HR (determined from the last n RR intervals). 
      Morphology changes due to respiration are simulated by coupling the RR interval to 
      the angular frequency of the dipole. We demonstrate an example of the use of this 
      model by simulating T-Wave Alternans (TWA). The magnitude of the TWA effect is 
      modeled as a disturbance on the T-loop of the dipole with a magnitude that differs 
      in each of the three VCG planes. The effect is then turned on or off using a HMM. 
      The values of the transition matrix are determined by the local heart rate, such 
      that when the HR ramps up towards 100 BPM, the probability of observing a TWA effect 
      rapidly but smoothly increases. In this way, no 'sudden' switching from non-TWA to 
      TWA is observed, and the natural tendency for TWA to be associated with a critical 
      HR-related activation level is simulated. Finally, to generate multi-lead signals, 
      the VCG is mapped to any set of clinical leads using a Dower-like transform derived 
      from a least-squares optimization between known VCGs and known lead morphologies. 
      ECGs with calibrated amounts of TWA were generated by this model and included in the 
      PhysioNet/CinC Challenge 2008 data set.

TI  - A low-complexity algorithm for detection of atrial fibrillation using an ECG.
PG  - 064003
LID - 10.1088/1361-6579/aac76c [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We present a method for automatic processing of single-lead 
      electrocardiogram (ECG) with duration of up to 60 s for the detection of atrial 
      fibrillation (AF). The method categorises an ECG recording into one of four 
      categories: normal, AF, other and noisy rhythm. For training the classification 
      model, 8528 scored ECG signals were used; for independent performance assessment, 
      3658 scored ECG signals. APPROACH: Our method was based on features derived from RR 
      interbeat intervals. The features included time domain, frequency domain and 
      distribution features. We assessed the performance of three different classifiers 
      (linear and quadratic discriminant analysis, and quadratic neural network (QNN)) on 
      the training set using 100-fold cross-validation. The QNN was selected as the 
      highest performing classifier, and a further performance assessment on the test data 
      made. MAIN RESULTS: On the test set, our method achieved an F1 score for the normal, 
      AF, other and noisy classes of 0.90, 0.75, 0.68 and 0.32, respectively. The overall 
      F1 score was 0.78. SIGNIFICANCE: The computational cost of our algorithm is low as 
      all features are derived from RR intervals and are processed by a single hidden 
      layer neural network. This makes it potentially suitable for low-power devices.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To measure the magnitude of the effect of an individualized 
      parameterization protocol for hemodynamic alarms in patients with acute myocardial 
      infarction. METHOD: Pragmatic clinical trial, open label and single arm, whose 
      intervention was performed through a protocol validated and tested in 32 patients 
      using multiparametric monitors. The heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, 
      oxygen saturation and ST segment-monitoring were measured and classified for 
      clinical consistency one hour before and after the intervention, for 64 hours. 
      RESULTS: The protocol obtained Content Validity Index of 0.92. Of the 460 registered 
      alarms, 261 were considered inconsistent before the intervention and 47 after it. 
      The Relative Risk of inconsistent alarms after the protocol was 0.32 (95% CI 
      0.23-0.43, p <0.0001). CONCLUSION: The protocol proved to be a protective factor to 
      the appearance of inconsistent clinical alarms of multiparametric monitors.

PG  - 419-22
AB  - The use of spectral techniques to quantify short term heart rate fluctuations on the 
      order of seconds to minutes has helped define the autonomic contributions to 
      beat-to-beat control of heart rate. We used similar techniques to quantify the 
      entire spectrum (0.00003-1.0 Hz) of heart rate variability during 24 hour ambulatory 
      ECG monitoring. The ECG from standard Holter monitor recordings from normal subjects 
      was sampled with the use of a phase locked loop, and a heart rate time series was 
      constructed at 3 Hz. Frequency analysis of the heart rate signal was performed after 
      a nonlinear filtering algorithm was used to eliminate artifacts. A power spectrum of 
      the entire 24 hour record revealed power that was inversely proportional to 
      frequency, 1/f, over 4 decades from 0.00003 to 0.1 Hz (period approximately 10 hours 
      to 10 seconds). Displaying consecutive spectra calculated at 5 minute intervals 
      revealed marked variability in the peaks at all frequencies throughout the 24 hours, 
      probably accounting for the lack of distinct peaks in the spectra of the entire 
      records.

TI  - Ultradian rhythms during day and night in normal and COPD subjects.
PG  - 1120-2
AB  - The analysis of heart rate variability (HRV) is a powerful tool in the study of the 
      autonomic control of the heart. While circadian HRV rhythms have widely been 
      characterized by traditional spectral measures, ultradian oscillations are not 
      commonly investigated. In this study the identification of HRV ultradian rhythms is 
      assigned to a quantitative measure characterizing the fractal-like behavior of the 
      time series: the fractal dimension (FD). In order to assess ultradian regulation in 
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) 24-h Holter ECG recordings of 52 COPD 
      and 10 normal (healthy) subjects were analyzed. The FD was calculated by Higuchi's 
      algorithm both during daytime and nighttime to highlight possible wake-sleep states 
      differences. All subjects showed a similar common rhythm (0.06mHz) that persists 
      with generally higher amplitude during night-time. A further rhythm becomes 
      predominant in normal subjects in the day-to-night transition (0.15mHz), probably 
      under the influence of the REM/non-REM ultradian sleep cycle. A very large 
      difference between night and day amplitudes of this rhythm and of the next one (at 
      about 0.22mHz) characterize the HRV fractal dimension of the Normal in respect of 
      COPD. In conclusion, the FD could be used as a marker of ultradian cardiac autonomic 
      regulation providing new insights into autonomic physiology of normal and COPD 
      patients.

TI  - Probabilistic estimation of respiratory rate using Gaussian processes.
PG  - 2902-5
LID - 10.1109/EMBC.2013.6610147 [doi]
AB  - The presence of respiratory information within the electrocardiogram (ECG) signal is 
      a well-documented phenomenon. We present a Gaussian process framework for the 
      estimation of respiratory rate from the different sources of modulation in a 
      single-lead ECG. We propose a periodic covariance function to model the frequency- 
      and amplitude-modulation time series derived from the ECG, where the hyperparameters 
      of the process are used to derive the respiratory rate. The approach is evaluated 
      using data taken from 40 healthy subjects each with 2 hours of monitoring, 
      containing ECG and respiration waveforms. Results indicate that the accuracy of our 
      proposed method is comparable with that of existing methods, but with the advantages 
      of a principled probabilistic approach, including the direct quantification of the 
      uncertainty in the estimation.

AB  - An automatic configuration that can detect the position of R-waves, classify the 
      normal sinus rhythm (NSR) and other four arrhythmic types from the continuous ECG 
      signals obtained from the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database is proposed. In this 
      configuration, a support vector machine (SVM) was used to detect and mark the ECG 
      heartbeats with raw signals and differential signals of a lead ECG. An algorithm 
      based on the extracted markers segments waveforms of Lead II and V1 of the ECG as 
      the pattern classification features. A self-constructing neural fuzzy inference 
      network (SoNFIN) was used to classify NSR and four arrhythmia types, including 
      premature ventricular contraction (PVC), premature atrium contraction (PAC), left 
      bundle branch block (LBBB), and right bundle branch block (RBBB). In a real 
      scenario, the classification results show the accuracy achieved is 96.4%. This 
      performance is suitable for a portable ECG monitor system for home care purposes.

TI  - Surgical implantation and functional assessment of an invasive telemetric system to 
      measure autonomic responses in domestic pigs.

AB  - The first aim of this study was to establish a surgical procedure to implant a new 
      telemetric device for the continuous recording of electrocardiogram (ECG) and blood 
      pressure (BP) in freely moving pigs. A second aim was the functional assessment of 
      cardiovascular parameters, including heart rate variability (HRV) and blood pressure 
      variability (BPV), so that these data could be used as the basis for the objective 
      evaluation of autonomic activity and balance in different behavioural contexts. 
      Eleven domestic pigs (German Landrace) underwent surgery for the placement of a 
      telemetric device. At day 15 after surgery, 512 consecutive inter-beat intervals and 
      pressure waves were analysed using different detection methods (automatic and 
      manually corrected) while the animals were resting or feeding, respectively. HRV and 
      BPV were calculated. Incomplete datasets were found in four pigs due to missing ECG 
      or BP signals. Technical and surgical issues concerning catheterisation and 
      detachment of the negative ECG lead were continuously improved. In the remaining 
      pigs, excellent signal quality (manually corrected data of 1%) was obtained during 
      resting and acceptable signal quality (<10%) was obtained during feeding. Automatic 
      triggering was sufficiently reliable to eliminate errors in BP recordings during 
      active behaviour, but this was not the case for ECG recordings. Sympathetic arousal 
      with accompanying vagal withdrawal during feeding was documented. The established 
      surgical implantation and functional assessment of the telemetric system with the 
      reliable registration of cardiovascular parameters in freely moving pigs could serve 
      as a basis for future studies of autonomic regulation in context of stress and 
      animal welfare.

TI  - The use of heart rate variability for the early detection of treatable complications 
      after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.
PG  - 385-93
LID - 10.1007/s10877-013-9467-0 [doi]
AB  - High-grade aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage patients are monitored in the ICU for 
      up to 21 days, as they are at risk for complications such as vasospasm of cerebral 
      arteries, cardiac arrhythmias and neurogenic stress cardiomyopathy. The diagnosis of 
      these treatable complications is often delayed by the limitations of monitoring 
      capabilities. We applied computational analysis to a cohort of 24 aneurysmal 
      subarachnoid hemorrhage patients, to identify heart rate variability and ECG 
      frequency profiles that may be potential biomarkers of severe vasospasm, reversible 
      cardiomyopathy and death.

TI  - Heart rate variability in the human transplanted heart: nonlinear dynamics and QT vs 
      RR-QT alterations during exercise suggest a return of neurocardiac regulation in 
      long-term recovery.
PG  - 289-305
AB  - RATIONALE: Functional reinnervation of the transplanted human heart by the autonomic 
      nervous system has not been demonstrated. A lack of autonomic control of the 
      transplanted allograft is reflected by an increased resting heart rate, a sluggish 
      heart rate response to dynamical exercise and a reduced heart rate variability. 
      Recent evidence suggests that a measure of deterministic chaos in the heartbeat 
      interval series (point correlation dimension, PD2i) is superior to the conventional 
      power spectrum or other stochastic measures in detecting changes in the mechanism 
      underlying heartbeat generation. METHODS: The PD2i is based on the presumption that 
      the variability is determined and patterned, whereas the stochastic measures all 
      assume that the variability is around a stationary mean and is noise. The PD2i 
      reconstructs the degrees of freedom (number of independent variables) in the system 
      that generates the time series examined, and does this irrespective of whether the 
      system is stochastic or deterministic and is stationary in time. RESULTS: PD2i was 
      determined for heartbeat intervals (RR, ECG digitized at 1200 Hz; supine posture) of 
      23 heart transplant recipients (HTR: 9 adults, 14 children; 0.04-7.7 years after 
      transplantation) and 21 healthy control subjects (CTL; 13 adults, 8 children). The 
      PD2i (+/-SD) averaged 5.4 +/- 0.7 for the CTL adults and 5.4 +/- 0.6 for the CTL 
      children. Mean PD2i was reduced after transplantation to 1.1 +/- 0.1 in 6 HTRs 
      recorded within 1 year after surgery; in one HTR recorded 2 weeks after surgery the 
      mean PD2i was 3.7. Between 1 to 2 years PD2i was found increased in 2 of 3 subjects 
      and between 2 to 8 years it was increased in 13 of 13, but not to control levels. In 
      normal hearts the QT subinterval of each heartbeat cycle is associated with inotropy 
      and the RR-QT remainder with chronotropy (i.e., the dyastolic interval during which 
      RR is primarily regulated). To examine more closely the residual and returning 
      heartbeat dynamics of the HTR subjects, these subinterval series were examined 
      during mild exercise (40 to 90 Watts) and its recovery. In recent HTRs, resting QT 
      and RR-QT were moderately reduced and modulated by exercise and recovery, but with 
      an approximate 100 beat latency. In long-term (7-8 years) HTR subjects there was a 
      rapid and larger response to exercise/recovery, but compared to normal the range was 
      smaller and the complexity of the subinterval trajectories in time was simpler. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Recurrence of low-dimensional deterministic dynamics after 
      transplantation suggests recovery of neurocardiac control attributable to 1) 
      reorganization of the viable intrinsic cardiac nervous system, 2) reinnervation by 
      the extrinsic autonomic nervous system, or 3) both.

TI  - ECG signal classification for the detection of cardiac arrhythmias using a 
      convolutional recurrent neural network.
PG  - 094006
LID - 10.1088/1361-6579/aad9ed [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The electrocardiogram (ECG) provides an effective, non-invasive approach 
      for clinical diagnosis in patients with cardiac diseases such as atrial fibrillation 
      (AF). AF is the most common cardiac rhythm disturbance and affects ~2% of the 
      general population in industrialized countries. Automatic AF detection in clinics 
      remains a challenging task due to the high inter-patient variability of ECGs, and 
      unsatisfactory existing approaches for AF diagnosis (e.g. atrial or ventricular 
      activity-based analyses). APPROACH: We have developed RhythmNet, a 21-layer 1D 
      convolutional recurrent neural network, trained using 8528 single-lead ECG 
      recordings from the 2017 PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology (CinC) Challenge, to 
      classify ECGs of different rhythms including AF automatically. Our RhythmNet 
      architecture contained 16 convolutions to extract features directly from raw ECG 
      waveforms, followed by three recurrent layers to process ECGs of varying lengths and 
      to detect arrhythmia events in long recordings. Large 15  ×  1 convolutional filters 
      were used to effectively learn the detailed variations of the signal within small 
      time-frames such as the P-waves and QRS complexes. We employed residual connections 
      throughout RhythmNet, along with batch-normalization and rectified linear activation 
      units to improve convergence during training. MAIN RESULTS: We evaluated our 
      algorithm on 3658 testing data and obtained an F (1) accuracy of 82% for classifying 
      sinus rhythm, AF, and other arrhythmias. RhythmNet was also ranked 5th in the 2017 
      CinC Challenge. SIGNIFICANCE: Potentially, our approach could aid AF diagnosis in 
      clinics and be used for patient self-monitoring to improve the early detection and 
      effective treatment of AF.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Guidelines recommend continuous ECG monitoring in patients 
      with cerebrovascular events. Studies on intensive care units (ICU) demonstrated high 
      sensitivity but high rates of false alarms of monitoring systems resulting in 
      desensitization of medical personnel potentially endangering patient safety. Data on 
      patients with acute stroke are lacking. METHODS: One-hundred fifty-one consecutive 
      patients with acute cerebrovascular events were prospectively included. 
      Automatically identified arrhythmia events were analyzed by manual ECG analysis. 
      Muting of alarms was registered. Sensitivity was evaluated by beat-to-beat analysis 
      of the entire recorded ECG data in a subset of patients. Ethics approval was 
      obtained by University of Erlangen-Nuremberg. RESULTS: A total of 4809.5 hours of 
      ECG registration and 22 509 alarms were analyzed. The automated detection algorithm 
      missed no events but the overall rate of false alarms was 27.4%. Only 0.6% of all 
      alarms indicated acute life-threatening events and 91.4% of these alarms were 
      incorrect. Transient muting of acoustic alarms was observed in 20.5% patients. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Continuous ECG monitoring using automated arrhythmia detection is 
      highly sensitive in acute stroke. However, high rates of false alarms and alarms 
      without direct therapeutic consequence cause desensitization of personnel. 
      Therefore, acoustic alarms may be limited to life-threatening events but 
      standardized manual evaluation of all alarms should complement automated systems to 
      identify clinically relevant arrhythmias.

AB  - Fundamental understanding of higher cognitive functions can greatly benefit from 
      imaging of cortical activity with high spatiotemporal resolution in the behaving 
      non-human primate. To achieve rapid imaging of high-resolution dynamics of cortical 
      representations of spontaneous and evoked activity, we designed a novel data 
      acquisition protocol for sensory stimulation by rapidly interleaving multiple 
      stimuli in continuous sessions of optical imaging with voltage-sensitive dyes. We 
      also tested a new algorithm for the "temporally structured component analysis" 
      (TSCA) of a multidimensional time series that was developed for our new data 
      acquisition protocol, but was tested only on simulated data (Blumenfeld, 2010). In 
      addition to the raw data, the algorithm incorporates prior knowledge about the 
      temporal structure of the data as well as input from other information. Here we 
      showed that TSCA can successfully separate functional signal components from other 
      signals referred to as noise. Imaging of responses to multiple visual stimuli, 
      utilizing voltage-sensitive dyes, was performed on the visual cortex of awake 
      monkeys. Multiple cortical representations, including orientation and ocular 
      dominance maps as well as the hitherto elusive retinotopic representation of 
      orientation stimuli, were extracted in only 10s of imaging, approximately two orders 
      of magnitude faster than accomplished by conventional methods. Since the approach is 
      rather general, other imaging techniques may also benefit from the same stimulation 
      protocol. This methodology can thus facilitate rapid optical imaging explorations in 
      monkeys, rodents and other species with a versatility and speed that were not 
      feasible before.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Accurate measurement of QRS complex duration (QRSd) remains crucial for 
      the selection of patients for cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). However, 
      assessment of QRSd on conventional surface electrocardiograms (ECG), especially when 
      performed without computer assistance, may be challenging due to the limited 
      accuracy of the human eye to discriminate differences in the range of 10 ms at 
      25 mm/s. The value and reproducibility of visual assessment of QRSd at 25 mm/s on 
      conventional ECGs was compared to those obtained using an electrophysiology 
      recording system (EPRS) with simultaneous 12 lead traces at 100 mm/s, which was 
      considered the gold standard. METHODS: The ECGs of 102 consecutive patients with 
      left ventricular dysfunction undergoing electrophysiological evaluation were 
      collected. Two sets of measurements were obtained: 1) QRSd-25 measured on 
      conventional 12-lead ECGs printed at 25 mm/s with standard amplification (10 mm/mV) 
      by 4 different observers, and 2) QRSd-100 measured on simultaneous 12-lead traces at 
      100 mm/s and 40 mm/mV by 2 different observers using electronic callipers. RESULTS: 
      Significant differences were observed between QRSd-100 and QRSd-25 measurements 
      (19.3 ± 9.9 ms, range 1.0-47.5, p < 0.001). QRSd-25 showed significant inter and 
      intra-observer variability. When categorizing individual ECGs in three QRSd-25 
      subgroups (<120 ms, 120-149 ms and ≥150 ms), low concordance was observed between 
      both techniques (kappa index 0.25, p < 0.001). The sensitivity and specificity of 
      QRSd-25 to detect QRSd-100 ≥ 150 ms was 36.6% and 100.0% respectively. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Visual measurement of QRSd at 25 mm/s often underestimates its magnitude and 
      presents significant inter and intraobserver variability.

TI  - Haemodynamic adaptation during sudden gravity transitions.
PG  - 79-89
LID - 10.1007/s00421-011-1956-6 [doi]
AB  - Haemodynamic responses during parabolic flight were studied. The hypothesis that 
      haemodynamic changes may be counteracted by a transient vagal reflex during acute 
      gravity transitions was tested. ECG, arterial pressure and respiration were recorded 
      continuously in seven male subjects during parabolic flight. Beat-to-beat 
      haemodynamic parameters were estimated. In the supine position no significant 
      differences were shown among the different gravity phases. In the upright position, 
      significant within-group differences were observed across gravity phases for all 
      parameters. Postural differences in haemodynamic data disappeared during the 
      microgravity phase and were enlarged during hypergravity phases. Detailed temporal 
      analysis of cardiac time series in standing subjects confirmed the hypothesized 
      biphasic response of initial parasympathetic modulation: a sharp increase of RRI 
      within 3-5 s followed by a 10% decrease in the remaining period of microgravity (p < 
      0.001); a sharp increase in SAP within 2-4 s followed by a slow decrease of 25%. 
      Significant within-group differences were observed in the standing position for mean 
      RRI (836 ± 170 ms, p = 0.003), DAP (66 ± 8 mmHg, p < 0.001), MAP (139 ± 12 mmHg, p = 
      0.001), RRI HF amplitude (17.6 ± 7.5 ms, p < 0.001), SV (146 ± 5%, p < 0.001) and 
      SVR (73 ± 10%, p = 0.020). In standing subjects, the initial baroreflex-mediated 
      vagal heart rate response is limited to a transition period at early microgravity 
      lasting about 3-5 s, followed by a gradual heart rate recovery during the remaining 
      15-17 s due to a parasympathetic withdrawal. The resultant increase in cardiac 
      output induces a baroreflex-mediated systemic vasodilatation, which may be the 
      driving force for a decreased arterial pressure in weightlessness.

TI  - Performance Evaluation of New-Generation Pulse Oximeters in the NICU: Observational 
      Study.
PG  - 383-91
LID - 10.1007/s13239-015-0229-7 [doi]
AB  - This crossover observational study compares the data characteristics and performance 
      of new-generation Nellcor OXIMAX and Masimo SET SmartPod pulse oximeter 
      technologies. The study was conducted independent of either original equipment 
      manufacturer (OEM) across eleven preterm infants in a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit 
      (NICU). The SmartPods were integrated with Dräger Infinity Delta monitors. The Delta 
      monitor measured the heart rate (HR) using an independent electrocardiogram sensor, 
      and the two SmartPods collected arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2) and pulse rate 
      (PR). All patient data were non-Gaussian. Nellcor PR showed a higher correlation 
      with the HR as compared to Masimo PR. The statistically significant difference found 
      in their median values (1% for SpO2, 1 bpm for PR) was deemed clinically 
      insignificant. SpO2 alarms generated by both SmartPods were observed and categorized 
      for performance evaluation. Results for sensitivity, positive predictive value, 
      accuracy and false alarm rates were Nellcor (80.3, 50, 44.5, 50%) and Masimo (72.2, 
      48.2, 40.6, 51.8%) respectively. These metrics were not statistically significantly 
      different between the two pulse oximeters. Despite claims by OEMs, both pulse 
      oximeters exhibited high false alarm rates, with no statistically or clinically 
      significant difference in performance. These findings have a direct impact on alarm 
      fatigue in the NICU. Performance evaluation studies can also impact medical device 
      purchase decisions made by hospital administrators.

TI  - QT/RR relation during atrial fibrillation based on a single beat analysis in 24-h 
      Holter ECG: the role of the second and further preceding RR intervals in QT 
      modification.
PG  - 269-74
LID - 10.1016/j.jjcc.2011.01.013 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: During atrial fibrillation (AF) irregularity of RR intervals may modify 
      QT/RR relation differently from sinus rhythm. The purpose of this study was to 
      compare QT/RR relation based on a single-beat analysis using the first preceding RR 
      interval with the modified RR interval reflecting not only the first preceding but 
      also the second and further preceding RR intervals during AF. METHODS: QT and RR 
      intervals were measured using an automatic QT analyzing system in 32 patients who 
      had both AF and sinus rhythm on the same 24-h Holter ECG recording. In 12 patients 
      antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) were administered. To reflect irregularity of the 
      preceding RR intervals during AF, a modified RR (mRR) using a weighted average of 
      five successive RR intervals: (5RR(1)+2RR(2)+RR(3)+RR(4)+RR(5))/10 was adopted. 
      Linear regression analyses between QT and RR intervals were performed using the 
      preceding RR(1) (QT/RR) and the modified RR (QT/mRR) during AF. RESULTS: During AF 
      the slope of QT/RR was lower than that of QT/mRR and was also lower than that of 
      QT/RR during sinus rhythm in patients with and without AAD. Slopes of regression 
      line in QT/RR during sinus rhythm, QT/RR and QT/mRR during AF were steeper in 
      patients with AAD than those in patients without. Slopes of QT/RR during sinus 
      rhythm correlated with those of QT/mRR (r=0.79, p<0.01) better than those of QT/RR 
      (r=0.64, p<0.05) during AF. QT interval at an RR interval of 1.20s or 1.00 s 
      obtained from QT/RR during AF was significantly smaller than that during sinus 
      rhythm in patients with and without AAD. CONCLUSIONS: The slope of QT/mRR during AF 
      became closer to that of QT/RR during sinus rhythm compared with that of QT/RR 
      during AF. QT interval during sinus rhythm could be estimated better using QT/mRR 
      than using QT/RR during AF.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to present the project of telecardiology within the ASP of 
      Cosenza, one of the largest provinces of Italy characterized by a particular 
      orography, with difficult and inaccessible roads. The goal of this project is to 
      manage the emergency more efficiently by reducing the time of intervention by 
      bringing the patient not to the nearest hospital, but more importantly to the 
      hospital more appropriately suited to better manage the cardiological emergency. 
      This system also uses the most modern web-based interface technology protected by 
      login and password. The project also provides the integration, supply and 
      installation of advanced and modern central by ensuring efficient screening is 
      carried out using monitors in all the coronary care units of the ASP of Cosenza, 
      networking with electrocardiography of all the point of first medical contact and 
      all the 118 emergency rescue service. By integrating all these procedures and 
      information and making them available to any point in the hospital and territorial 
      network, this project becomes not only a more efficient system for managing cardiac 
      emergency but also a pathway that will guarantee increased care of patients from the 
      onset of symptoms to discharge.

TI  - Individual and institutional factors affecting cardiac monitoring in coronary care 
      units: a national survey of Chinese nurses.
PG  - 570-8
LID - 10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2011.10.004 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: As cardiovascular diseases have become the leading cause of death in 
      many countries including China, nurses are increasingly required to be abreast of 
      technological advances and the skills necessary to manage this increasing health 
      care problem. Chinese nurses are under pressure to provide skilled 
      electrocardiography monitoring, and be sufficiently skilled to detect myocardial 
      ischemia and infarction, in this large patient population. This presents a challenge 
      for the nursing profession in China, particularly for nurses working in coronary 
      care in a country where advancement has been so rapid, yet little research has been 
      conducted or reported in the literature. OBJECTIVES: The two main objectives were: 
      to explore the demographic and educational factors that affect the use of ST-segment 
      monitoring and correct electrode placement by CCU/ICU nurses in China; and to 
      explore the factors both individual and institutional that affect monitoring and 
      lead placement. METHODS: A self-administered questionnaire was distributed to nurses 
      in 126 randomly selected tertiary hospitals, which were stratified into three 
      homogeneous regions across China. The instrument examined demographics, information 
      about hospitals, electrocardiogram devices, current practice patterns and 
      perceptions toward monitoring and lead placement. Data from 734 nurses and 59 nurse 
      managers from 59 hospitals were analyzed using t-tests, ANOVA, Chi-square test and 
      logistic regression. RESULTS: Electrocardiogram monitoring was used to detect 
      myocardial ischemia by 43.7% of respondents, and 35.1% selected leads according to 
      electrocardiogram or angiography findings. Most (70%) agreed that monitoring for 
      acute coronary syndrome was important, while 39.2% did so, and 15.7% were able to 
      identify correct placement. Logistic regression revealed a significant relationship 
      between the uses of ST-segment monitoring and number of hospital beds, continuing 
      education and a belief in its use and ease of use. Correct electrode placement was 
      significantly correlated with respondents from university hospitals, hospitals with 
      more acute coronary syndrome admissions and more independent thinking nurses. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Despite best practice evidence, less than half of the sample used 
      electrocardiogram monitoring to detect myocardial ischemia and the majority could 
      not identify correct electrode placement, while ST-segment monitoring was not used 
      routinely. This paper highlights the need for improvements in education both in 
      universities and hospitals and discussion addresses conventions in units, which 
      inhibit development of nurses' skills.

      study".
PG  - 638-682
LID - 10.4103/0971-9784.191552 [doi]
AB  - Goal-directed therapy (GDT) encompasses guidance of intravenous (IV) fluid and 
      vasopressor/inotropic therapy by cardiac output or similar parameters to help in 
      early recognition and management of high-risk cardiac surgical patients. With the 
      aim of establishing the utility of perioperative GDT using robust clinical and 
      biochemical outcomes, we conducted the present study. This multicenter randomized 
      controlled study included 130 patients of either sex, with European system for 
      cardiac operative risk evaluation ≥3 undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting on 
      cardiopulmonary bypass. The patients were randomly divided into the control and GDT 
      group. All the participants received standardized care; arterial pressure monitored 
      through radial artery, central venous pressure (CVP) through a triple lumen in the 
      right internal jugular vein, electrocardiogram, oxygen saturation, temperature, 
      urine output per hour, and frequent arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis. In addition, 
      cardiac index (CI) monitoring using FloTrac™ and continuous central venous oxygen 
      saturation (ScVO2) using PreSep™ were used in patients in the GDT group. Our aim was 
      to maintain the CI at 2.5-4.2 L/min/m2, stroke volume index 30-65 ml/beat/m2, 
      systemic vascular resistance index 1500-2500 dynes/s/cm5/m2, oxygen delivery index 
      450-600 ml/min/m2, continuous ScVO2 >70%, and stroke volume variation <10%; in 
      addition to the control group parameters such as CVP 6-8 mmHg, mean arterial 
      pressure 90-105 mmHg, normal ABG values, oxygen saturation, hematocrit value >30%, 
      and urine output >1 ml/kg/h. The aims were achieved by altering the administration 
      of IV fluids and doses of inotropes or vasodilators. The data of sixty patients in 
      each group were analyzed in view of ten exclusions. The average duration of 
      ventilation (19.89 ± 3.96 vs. 18.05 ± 4.53 h, P = 0.025), hospital stay (7.94 ± 1.64 
      vs. 7.17 ± 1.93 days, P = 0.025), and Intensive Care Unit (ICU) stay (3.74 ± 0.59 
      vs. 3.41 ± 0.75 days, P = 0.012) was significantly less in the GDT group, compared 
      to the control group. The extra volume added and the number of inotropic dose 
      adjustments were significantly more in the GDT group. The two groups did not differ 
      in duration of inotropic use, mortality, and other complications. The perioperative 
      continuation of GDT affected the early decline in the lactate levels after 6 h in 
      ICU, whereas the control group demonstrated a settling lactate only after 12 h. 
      Similarly, the GDT group had significantly lower levels of brain natriuretic 
      peptide, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin levels as compared to the 
      control. The study clearly depicts the advantage of GDT for a favorable 
      postoperative outcome in high-risk cardiac surgical patients.

TI  - Low dose oral haloperidol does not prolong QTc interval in older acutely 
      hospitalised adults: a subanalysis of a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled 
      study.
PG  - 401-407
LID - 10.11909/j.issn.1671-5411.2018.06.003 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Haloperidol is the most frequently prescribed antipsychotic for delirium 
      symptoms. The risk of QTc prolongation often raises concerns, although the effect of 
      haloperidol on QTc interval has not yet been investigated in a randomised 
      placebo-controlled fixed-dose study. METHODS: A subanalysis of a randomised 
      double-blind placebo-controlled study was conducted to evaluate the effect of 
      prophylactic haloperidol 1 mg or placebo 1 mg orally twice-daily (maximum of 14 
      doses) on QTc interval in patients aged 70 years and over. Bedside, 12-lead ECGs 
      were recorded before, during and after the one-week intervention period. Automatic 
      QTc measurements were obtained in addition to manual measurements of QT and RR 
      intervals, blinded for treatment status. Manual measurements were corrected (QTc) 
      using Bazett (QTc-B), Framingham (QTc-Fa), Fridericia (QTc-Fi) and Hodges (QTc-H) 
      methods. Mixed model analyses were used to test for differences in longitudinal 
      course of QTc between patients receiving haloperidol and placebo. RESULTS: ECG 
      recordings of 72 patients (haloperidol n = 38) were analysed, 45.8% male. Median 
      (range) haloperidol serum concentration on day 4 was 0.71 (0.32-1.82) µg/L (n = 23). 
      Longitudinal course of mean QTc did not significantly differ between treatment arms 
      for any of the automatic or manually derived QTc values. CONCLUSIONS: Low dose oral 
      haloperidol did not result in QTc prolongation in older acutely hospitalised 
      patients. Results may not be generalizable to patients with existing ECG 
      abnormalities such as atrial fibrillation.

      effective means to denoise biologically sourced single channel signals, especially 
      Electromyogram (EMG) and Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals amongst others. There are 
      numerous applications whereby the signal acquisition process results in the mixing 
      of both types of signals along with body motion artifacts and the inevitable 
      electromagnetic interference. Both ECG and EMG signals are very useful to 
      physicians, though preferably in isolation, though they rarely present themselves in 
      this manner. Simple filtering techniques are ineffective in their separation as both 
      signal spectra overlap in the frequency domain. In this paper, we propose a 
      technique based on a sliding SSA algorithm which proves to be more successful in 
      separating real mixed EMG and ECG signals than traditional block based approaches on 
      single channel data. SSA is a non-parametric technique that decomposes the original 
      time series into a number of additive components, each of which can then be readily 
      identified based on statistical analysis as belonging to EMG or ECG signals. This 
      approach could be applied equally to other signal types using different statistical 
      methods as required, moreover, this technique is relatively straight-forward to 
      implement and does not require any reference signals or training.

      subarachnoid hemorrhage.
PG  - 382-9
LID - 10.1007/s12028-014-9966-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We sought to determine if monitoring heart rate variability (HRV) would 
      enable preclinical detection of secondary complications after subarachnoid 
      hemorrhage (SAH). METHODS: We studied 236 SAH patients admitted within the first 48 
      h of bleed onset, discharged after SAH day 5, and had continuous electrocardiogram 
      records available. The diagnosis and date of onset of infections and DCI events were 
      prospectively adjudicated and documented by the clinical team. Continuous ECG was 
      collected at 240 Hz using a high-resolution data acquisition system. The 
      Tompkins-Hamilton algorithm was used to identify R-R intervals excluding ectopic and 
      abnormal beats. Time, frequency, and regularity domain calculations of HRV were 
      generated over the first 48 h of ICU admission and 24 h prior to the onset of each 
      patient's first complication, or SAH day 6 for control patients. Clinical prediction 
      rules to identify infection and DCI events were developed using bootstrap 
      aggregation and cost-sensitive meta-classifiers. RESULTS: The combined infection and 
      DCI model predicted events 24 h prior to clinical onset with high sensitivity (87 %) 
      and moderate specificity (66 %), and was more sensitive than models that predicted 
      either infection or DCI. Models including clinical and HRV variables together 
      substantially improved diagnostic accuracy (AUC 0.83) compared to models with only 
      HRV variables (AUC 0.61). CONCLUSIONS: Changes in HRV after SAH reflect both delayed 
      ischemic and infectious complications. Incorporation of concurrent disease severity 
      measures substantially improves prediction compared to using HRV alone. Further 
      research is needed to refine and prospectively evaluate real-time bedside HRV 
      monitoring after SAH.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Sudden cardiac arrest continues to be the leading cause of death in 
      the industrialized world. SOURCES OF DATA: Original papers, reviews and guidelines. 
      AREAS OF AGREEMENT: Community programs for lay bystander cardiopulmonary 
      resuscitation (CPR) and automatic external defibrillation improve outcomes. 
      Post-arrest care, including targeted temperature management (TTM) combined with 
      early coronary angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention, is helpful for 
      those suffering cardiac arrest during an ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. 
      AREAS OF CONTROVERSY: (1) The optimal approach to encourage lay bystanders to assist 
      with resuscitation efforts. (2) Whether TTM combined with early coronary angiography 
      is cost effective for those without ST elevation on their post-arrest ECG is 
      unknown. GROWING POINTS: Increasing data show that chest compression-only CPR is 
      preferred by lay rescuers and improves local survival rates. AREAS TIMELY FOR 
      DEVELOPING RESEARCH: Randomized clinical trials are underway to examine the utility 
      of early coronary angiography in the treatment of post-arrest patients without 
      ST-segment elevation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Pneumonia is the leading infectious cause of death. Early deterioration 
      and death commonly result from progressive sepsis, shock, respiratory failure, and 
      cardiac complications. Recent data suggest that cardiac arrest may also be common, 
      yet few previous studies have addressed this. Accordingly, we sought to characterize 
      early cardiac arrest in patients who are hospitalized with coexisting pneumonia. 
      METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of a multicenter cardiac arrest 
      database, with data from > 500 North American hospitals. We included in-hospital 
      cardiac arrest events that occurred in community-dwelling adults with pneumonia 
      within the first 72 h after hospital admission. We compared patient and event 
      characteristics for patients with and without pneumonia. For patients with 
      pneumonia, we also compared events according to event location. RESULTS: We 
      identified 4,453 episodes of early cardiac arrest in patients who were hospitalized 
      with pneumonia. Among patients with preexisting pneumonia, only 36.5% were receiving 
      mechanical ventilation and only 33.3% were receiving infusions of vasoactive drugs 
      prior to cardiac arrest. Only 52.3% of patients on the ward were receiving ECG 
      monitoring prior to cardiac arrest. Shockable rhythms were uncommon in all patients 
      with pneumonia (ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation, 14.8%). Patients on the 
      ward were significantly older than patients in the ICU. CONCLUSIONS: In patients 
      with preexisting pneumonia, cardiac arrest may occur in the absence of preceding 
      shock or respiratory failure. Physicians should be alert to the possibility of 
      abrupt cardiopulmonary collapse, and future studies should address this possibility. 
      The mechanism may involve myocardial ischemia, a maladaptive response to hypoxia, 
      sepsis-related cardiomyopathy, or other phenomena.

AB  - This article presents a new deep learning approach for cardiac arrhythmia (17 
      classes) detection based on long-duration electrocardiography (ECG) signal analysis. 
      Cardiovascular disease prevention is one of the most important tasks of any health 
      care system as about 50 million people are at risk of heart disease in the world. 
      Although automatic analysis of ECG signal is very popular, current methods are not 
      satisfactory. The goal of our research was to design a new method based on deep 
      learning to efficiently and quickly classify cardiac arrhythmias. Described research 
      are based on 1000 ECG signal fragments from the MIT - BIH Arrhythmia database for 
      one lead (MLII) from 45 persons. Approach based on the analysis of 10-s ECG signal 
      fragments (not a single QRS complex) is applied (on average, 13 times less 
      classifications/analysis). A complete end-to-end structure was designed instead of 
      the hand-crafted feature extraction and selection used in traditional methods. Our 
      main contribution is to design a new 1D-Convolutional Neural Network model (1D-CNN). 
      The proposed method is 1) efficient, 2) fast (real-time classification) 3) 
      non-complex and 4) simple to use (combined feature extraction and selection, and 
      classification in one stage). Deep 1D-CNN achieved a recognition overall accuracy of 
      17 cardiac arrhythmia disorders (classes) at a level of 91.33% and classification 
      time per single sample of 0.015 s. Compared to the current research, our results are 
      one of the best results to date, and our solution can be implemented in mobile 
      devices and cloud computing.

      signals.

AB  - Electrocardiogram (ECG) is the electrical activity of the heart indicated by P, 
      Q-R-S and T wave. The minute changes in the amplitude and duration of ECG depicts a 
      particular type of cardiac abnormality. It is very difficult to decipher the hidden 
      information present in this nonlinear and nonstationary signal. An automatic 
      diagnostic system that characterizes cardiac activities in ECG signals would provide 
      more insight into these phenomena thereby revealing important clinical information. 
      Various methods have been proposed to detect cardiac abnormalities in ECG 
      recordings. Application of higher order spectra (HOS) features is a seemingly 
      promising approach because it can capture the nonlinear and dynamic nature of the 
      ECG signals. In this paper, we have automatically classified five types of beats 
      using HOS features (higher order cumulants) using two different approaches. The five 
      types of ECG beats are normal (N), right bundle branch block (RBBB), left bundle 
      branch block (LBBB), atrial premature contraction (APC) and ventricular premature 
      contraction (VPC). In the first approach, cumulant features of segmented ECG signal 
      were used for classification; whereas in the second approach cumulants of discrete 
      wavelet transform (DWT) coefficients were used as features for classifiers. In both 
      approaches, the cumulant features were subjected to data reduction using principal 
      component analysis (PCA) and classified using three layer feed-forward neural 
      network (NN) and least square-support vector machine (LS-SVM) classifiers. In this 
      study, we obtained the highest average accuracy of 94.52%, sensitivity of 98.61% and 
      specificity of 98.41% using first approach with NN classifier. The developed system 
      is ready clinically to run on large datasets.

AB  - BACKGROUND: It is widely accepted by the scientific community that bioelectrical 
      signals, which can be used for the identification of neurophysiological biomarkers 
      indicative of a diseased or pathological state, could direct patient treatment 
      towards more effective therapeutic strategies. However, the design and realisation 
      of an instrument that can precisely record weak bioelectrical signals in the 
      presence of strong interference stemming from a noisy clinical environment is one of 
      the most difficult challenges associated with the strategy of monitoring 
      bioelectrical signals for diagnostic purposes. Moreover, since patients often have 
      to cope with the problem of limited mobility being connected to bulky and 
      mains-powered instruments, there is a growing demand for small-sized, 
      high-performance and ambulatory biopotential acquisition systems in the Intensive 
      Care Unit (ICU) and in High-dependency wards. Finally, to the best of our knowledge, 
      there are no commercial, small, battery-powered, wearable and wireless 
      recording-only instruments that claim the capability of recording 
      electrocorticographic (ECoG) signals. METHODS: To address this problem, we designed 
      and developed a low-noise (8 nV/√Hz), eight-channel, battery-powered, wearable and 
      wireless instrument (55 × 80 mm(2)). The performance of the realised instrument was 
      assessed by conducting both ex vivo and in vivo experiments. RESULTS: To provide ex 
      vivo proof-of-function, a wide variety of high-quality bioelectrical signal 
      recordings are reported, including electroencephalographic (EEG), electromyographic 
      (EMG), electrocardiographic (ECG), acceleration signals, and muscle fasciculations. 
      Low-noise in vivo recordings of weak local field potentials (LFPs), which were 
      wirelessly acquired in real time using segmented deep brain stimulation (DBS) 
      electrodes implanted in the thalamus of a non-human primate, are also presented. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The combination of desirable features and capabilities of this 
      instrument, namely its small size (~one business card), its enhanced recording 
      capabilities, its increased processing capabilities, its manufacturability (since it 
      was designed using discrete off-the-shelf components), the wide bandwidth it offers 
      (0.5-500 Hz) and the plurality of bioelectrical signals it can precisely record, 
      render it a versatile and reliable tool to be utilized in a wide range of 
      applications and environments.

AB  - The aim of this paper was to study the effect of spontaneous arousals during 
      night-time sleep on the interactions between R-R intervals and respiratory phases in 
      healthy children. We collected overnight polysomnography data of 40 healthy children 
      and investigated cardio-respiratory interaction before and after spontaneous 
      arousals during stage 2 sleep using joint symbolic dynamics. The R-R time series 
      were extracted from electrocardiograms (ECG) and respiratory phases were obtained 
      from abdominal sensors using the Hilbert transform. Both the series were transformed 
      into ternary symbol vectors based on the changes between two successive R-R 
      intervals or respiratory phases, respectively. Subsequently, words of length '2' 
      were formed and the correspondence between words of the two series was determined to 
      quantify cardio-respiratory interaction for pre- and post-spontaneous arousal 
      episodes. We observed a brief but significant shortening in R-R and respiratory 
      intervals after arousal. There was also a significant short-term increase in 
      cardio-respiratory interaction during the first 30-second post-arousal episode as 
      compared to 30-second pre-arousal episode (7.5±3.4 vs. 5.2±3.7%, p&#60;0.0001, 
      respectively). In conclusion, spontaneous arousals in healthy children during 
      night-time sleep are associated with a temporal but significant increase in 
      cardio-respiratory interaction.

AB  - Telemedicine was recognized in the 1970s as a legitimate entity for applying the use 
      of modern information and communications technologies to the delivery of health 
      services. Telecardiology is one of the fastest growing fields in telemedicine. The 
      advancement of technologies and Web-based applications has allowed better 
      transmission of health care delivery. This article discusses current advancements, 
      the scope of telemedicine in cardiology, and its application to the critically ill. 
      The impact of telecardiology consultation continues to evolve and includes many 
      promising applications with potential positive implications for admission rates, 
      morbidity, and mortality.

TI  - Serotonin and catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia: a possible 
      therapeutic role for SSRIs?
PG  - 225-8
AB  - Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is a rare malignant 
      arrhythmia, usually diagnosed in the adolescent years. The diagnosis can typically 
      be made by one or more of the following: a positive family history, exercise 
      electrocardiography, ambulatory ECG monitoring and/or an intra-cardiac, 
      electrophysiological examination. This is a case report of a patient with CPVT that 
      was refractory to treatment with beta-blockade and an implanted automatic 
      cardioverter defibrillator. However, after a selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor 
      (SSRI) was added to the therapeutic regimen, no further episodes of ventricular 
      tachycardia occurred during the following two years.

TI  - Cardiorespiratory Coupling Analysis Based on Entropy and Cross-Entropy in 
      Distinguishing Different Depression Stages.
PG  - 359
LID - 10.3389/fphys.2019.00359 [doi]
LID - 359
AB  - AIMS: This study used entropy- and cross entropy-based methods to explore the 
      cardiorespiratory coupling of depressive patients, and thus to assess the values of 
      those entropy methods for identifying depression patients with different disease 
      severities. METHODS: Electrocardiogram (ECG) and respiration signals from 69 
      depression patients were recorded simultaneously for 5 min. Patients were classified 
      into three groups according to the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) scores: 
      group Non-De (HDRS 0-7), Mid-De (HDRS 8-17), and Con-De (HDRS >17). Sample entropy 
      (SEn), fuzzy measure entropy (FMEn) and high-frequency power (HF) were computed on 
      the original RR interval time series and breath-to-breath interval time series. 
      Cross sample entropy (CSEn) and cross fuzzy measure entropy (CFMEn) were computed on 
      interval time series resampled at 2 Hz and 4 Hz, respectively. The difference among 
      three patient groups and correlation between entropy values and HDRS scores were 
      analyzed by statistical analysis. Surrogate data were also employed to confirm the 
      validation of entropy measures in this study. RESULTS: A consistent increasing trend 
      has been found among most entropy measures from Non-De, to Mid-De, and to Con-De 
      groups, and a significant (p < 0.05) difference in FMEn of RR intervals exists 
      between Non-De and Mid-De or Con-De groups. Significant differences have been also 
      found in all cross entropies, between Non-De and Con-De groups and between Mid-De 
      and Con-De groups. Furthermore, significant correlations also exist between HDRS 
      scores and FMEn of RR intervals (R = 0.24, p < 0.05), CSEn at 4 Hz (R = 0.26, p < 
      0.05) or 2 Hz (R = 0.28, p < 0.05) resampling, and CFMEn at 4 Hz (R = 0.31, p < 
      0.01) or 2 Hz (R = 0.30, p < 0.05) resampling. A significant difference of 
      cardiorespiratory coupling parameters between different depression stages and 
      significant correlations between entropy measures and depression severity both 
      indicate central autonomic dysregulation in depression patients and reflect varying 
      degrees of vagal modulation reduction among different depression levels. Analysis 
      based on surrogate data confirms that the non-linear properties of the physiological 
      signals played a major role in depression recognition. CONCLUSION: The current study 
      demonstrates the potential of cardiorespiratory coupling in the auxiliary diagnosis 
      of depression based on the entropy method.

AB  - Computer systems for Electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis support the clinician in 
      tedious tasks (e.g., Holter ECG monitored in Intensive Care Units) or in prompt 
      detection of dangerous events (e.g., ventricular fibrillation). Together with 
      clinical applications (arrhythmia detection and heart rate variability analysis), 
      ECG is currently being investigated in biometrics (human identification), an 
      emerging area receiving increasing attention. Methodologies for clinical 
      applications can have both differences and similarities with respect to biometrics. 
      This paper reviews methods of ECG processing from a pattern recognition perspective. 
      In particular, we focus on features commonly used for heartbeat classification. 
      Considering the vast literature in the field and the limited space of this review, 
      we dedicated a detailed discussion only to a few classifiers (Artificial Neural 
      Networks and Support Vector Machines) because of their popularity; however, other 
      techniques such as Hidden Markov Models and Kalman Filtering will be also mentioned.

AB  - With age, our blood vessels are prone to aging, which induces cardiovascular 
      disease. As an important basis for diagnosing heart disease and evaluating heart 
      function, the electrocardiogram (ECG) records cardiac physiological electrical 
      activity. Abnormalities in cardiac physiological activity are directly reflected in 
      the ECG. Thus, ECG research is conducive to heart disease diagnosis. Considering the 
      complexity of arrhythmia detection, we present an improved convolutional neural 
      network (CNN) model for accurate classification. Compared with the traditional 
      machine learning methods, CNN requires no additional feature extraction steps due to 
      the automatic feature processing layers. In this paper, an improved CNN is proposed 
      to automatically classify the heartbeat of arrhythmia. Firstly, all the heartbeats 
      are divided from the original signals. After segmentation, the ECG heartbeats can be 
      inputted into the first convolutional layers. In the proposed structure, kernels 
      with different sizes are used in each convolution layer, which takes full advantage 
      of the features in different scales. Then a max-pooling layer followed. The outputs 
      of the last pooling layer are merged and as the input to fully-connected layers. Our 
      experiment is in accordance with the AAMI inter-patient standard, which included 
      normal beats (N), supraventricular ectopic beats (S), ventricular ectopic beats (V), 
      fusion beats (F), and unknown beats (Q). For verification, the MIT arrhythmia 
      database is introduced to confirm the accuracy of the proposed method, then, 
      comparative experiments are conducted. The experiment demonstrates that our proposed 
      method has high performance for arrhythmia detection, the accuracy is 99.06%. When 
      properly trained, the proposed improved CNN model can be employed as a tool to 
      automatically detect different kinds of arrhythmia from ECG.

TI  - Cyclic variation in heart rate score by holter electrocardiogram as screening for 
      sleep-disordered breathing in subjects with heart failure.
PG  - 72-80
LID - 10.4187/respcare.03341 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is critically associated with 
      cardiovascular mortality and morbidity, especially in patients with heart failure 
      (HF). However, the majority of SDB patients remain undiagnosed. In contrast, 
      abnormality in heart rate variability has been reported in patients with SDB. To 
      explore an efficient electrocardiogram (ECG)-based screening tool for SDB, we 
      examined the usefulness of cyclic variation in heart rate score (CVHRS) by Holter 
      ECG in subjects with HF. METHODS: In this study, 102 subjects with HF were enrolled. 
      We simultaneously performed Holter ECG with overnight portable sleep monitoring, and 
      we measured the respiratory disturbance index (RDI) and CVHRS. We determined the 
      temporal position of the individual dips comprising the CVHRS using time-domain 
      methods. CVHRS was measured as cyclic and autocorrelated dips in smoothed interbeat 
      interval time series. RESULTS: There were 25 subjects with severe SDB (RDI ≥ 30 
      events/h) and 77 subjects with none-to-moderate SDB (0 ≤ RDI < 30 events/h). There 
      was a significant positive correlation between CVHRS and RDI (r = 0.60, P < .001). 
      In receiver operating characteristic analysis, CVHRS (cutoff of 30 events/h) 
      identified severe SDB with a sensitivity of 82%, a specificity of 77%, and an area 
      under the curve of 0.83. CONCLUSIONS: CVHRS determined by Holter ECG is a useful 
      screening index for severe SDB in subjects with HF.

TI  - Prolonged Tpeak-end and Tpeak-end/QT ratio as predictors of malignant ventricular 
      arrhythmias in the acute phase of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction: a 
      prospective case-control study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Prolonged Tpeak-end (the interval from the peak of the T wave to the end 
      of the T wave) and Tpeak-end/QT ratio have been shown to be markers of 
      arrhythmogenesis in various cardiac disorders. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study 
      was to evaluate the utility of Tpeak-end and Tpeak-end/QT ratio at admission in 
      patients with acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) in predicting 
      malignant ventricular arrhythmias. METHODS: The study group included 50 patients 
      presenting with STEMI, in whom Tpeak-end and Tpeak-end/QT ratio were measured at 
      admission; these patients were monitored for arrhythmias with a continuous 
      electrocardiogram in the intensive care unit for 48 hours, and 50 healthy 
      individuals acted as controls. RESULTS: The Tpeak-end (0.11 ± 0.04 seconds vs 0.08 ± 
      0.006 seconds; P < .0010) and Tpeak-end/QT ratio (0.30 ± 0.06 vs 0.21 ± 0.02; P < 
      .001) were prolonged in patients with STEMI. Three patients with STEMI who sustained 
      ventricular fibrillation (VF) within 24 hours of admission had prolonged corrected 
      QT interval (0.39 ± 0.04 seconds vs 0.46 ± 0.13 seconds; P = .019), Tpeak-end (0.10 
      ± 0.02 seconds vs 0.20 ± 0.11 seconds; P < .001), and Tpeak-end/QT ratio (0.26 ± 
      0.05 vs 0.41 ± 0.09; P < .001) as compared with patients with STEMI without VF. 
      Tpeak-end > 0.1 seconds and Tpeak-end/QT ratio > 0.3 predicted VF with a sensitivity 
      of 100%. However, the Tpeak-end/QT ratio had a higher specificity (82.9% for 
      Tpeak-end/QT ratio vs 44.7% for Tpeak-end) and accuracy (84% for Tpeak-end/QT ratio 
      vs 48% for Tpeak-end). CONCLUSION: Tpeak-end and Tpeak-end/QT ratio are prolonged in 
      patients with STEMI compared with healthy individuals, and Tpeak-end > 0.1 and 
      Tpeak-end/QT ratio > 0.3 predict malignant ventricular arrhythmias within 24 hours 
      of STEMI.

TI  - Detection of Atrial fibrillation from non-episodic ECG data: a review of methods.
PG  - 4992-5
LID - 10.1109/IEMBS.2011.6091237 [doi]
AB  - Atrial fibrillation (A-fib) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia. To effectively 
      treat or prevent A-fib, automatic A-fib detection based on Electrocardiograph (ECG) 
      monitoring is highly desirable. This paper reviews recently developed techniques for 
      A-fib detection based on non-episodic surface ECG monitoring data. A-fib detection 
      methods in the literature can be mainly classified into three categories: (1) time 
      domain methods; (2) frequency domain methods; and (3) non-linear methods. In general 
      the performances of these methods were evaluated in terms of sensitivity, 
      specificity and overall detection accuracy on the datasets from the Physionet 
      repository. Based on our survey, we conclude that no promising A-fib detection 
      method that performs consistently well across various scenarios has been proposed 
      yet.

TI  - Electrocardiogram characteristics prior to in-hospital cardiac arrest.
PG  - 385-92
LID - 10.1007/s10877-014-9616-0 [doi]
AB  - Survival after in-hospital cardiac arrest (I-HCA) remains < 30 %. There is very 
      limited literature exploring the electrocardiogram changes prior to I-HCA. The 
      purpose of the study was to determine demographics and electrocardiographic 
      predictors prior to I-HCA. A retrospective study was conducted among 39 
      cardiovascular subjects who had cardiopulmonary resuscitation from I-HCA with 
      initial rhythms of pulseless electrical activity (PEA) and asystole. Demographics 
      including medical history, ejection fraction, laboratory values, and medications 
      were examined. Electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters from telemetry were studied to 
      identify changes in heart rate, QRS duration and morphology, and time of occurrence 
      and location of ST segment changes prior to I-HCA. Increased age was significantly 
      associated with failure to survive to discharge (p < 0.05). Significant change was 
      observed in heart rate including a downtrend of heart rate within 15 min prior to 
      I-HCA (p < 0.05). There was a significant difference in heart rate and QRS duration 
      during the last hour prior to I-HCA compared to the previous hours (p < 0.05). 
      Inferior ECG leads showed the most significant changes in QRS morphology and ST 
      segments prior to I-HCA (p < 0.05). Subjects with an initial rhythm of asystole 
      demonstrated significantly greater ECG changes including QRS morphology and ST 
      segment changes compared to the subjects with initial rhythms of PEA (p < 0.05). 
      Diagnostic ECG trends can be identified prior to I-HCA due to PEA and asystole and 
      can be further utilized for training a predictive machine learning model for I-HCA.

TI  - An advanced algorithm for fetal heart rate estimation from non-invasive low 
      electrode density recordings.
PG  - 1621-36
LID - 10.1088/0967-3334/35/8/1621 [doi]
AB  - Non-invasive fetal electrocardiography is still an open research issue. The recent 
      publication of an annotated dataset on Physionet providing four-channel non-invasive 
      abdominal ECG traces promoted an international challenge on the topic. Starting from 
      that dataset, an algorithm for the identification of the fetal QRS complexes from a 
      reduced number of electrodes and without any a priori information about the 
      electrode positioning has been developed, entering into the top ten best-performing 
      open-source algorithms presented at the challenge.In this paper, an improved version 
      of that algorithm is presented and evaluated exploiting the same challenge metrics. 
      It is mainly based on the subtraction of the maternal QRS complexes in every lead, 
      obtained by synchronized averaging of morphologically similar complexes, the 
      filtering of the maternal P and T waves and the enhancement of the fetal QRS through 
      independent component analysis (ICA) applied on the processed signals before a final 
      fetal QRS detection stage. The RR time series of both the mother and the fetus are 
      analyzed to enhance pseudoperiodicity with the aim of correcting wrong annotations. 
      The algorithm has been designed and extensively evaluated on the open dataset A 
      (N = 75), and finally evaluated on datasets B (N = 100) and C (N = 272) to have the 
      mean scores over data not used during the algorithm development. Compared to the 
      results achieved by the previous version of the algorithm, the current version would 
      mark the 5th and 4th position in the final ranking related to the events 1 and 2, 
      reserved to the open-source challenge entries, taking into account both official and 
      unofficial entrants. On dataset A, the algorithm achieves 0.982 median sensitivity

AB  - This paper discusses the effect of atrioventricular conduction time (AVCT) on the 
      short-term Heart Rate Variability (HRV) by computing HRV parameters using intervals 
      between the onsets of successive P waves (PP time series) for three groups: normal, 
      arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death (SCD) patients. A very precise wavelet transform 
      based ECG delineator was developed to detect PP, PR and RR time series. Mean PR 
      variation in arrhythmia and SCD group was found to be significantly high as compared 
      to the normal group. It was observed that when PR variations in arrhythmia and SCD 
      cases crossed a certain threshold, RR variability no longer provided a very accurate 
      estimate of HRV. In such cases, PP variability was able to provide a better 
      assessment of HRV.

TI  - The ability of several short-term measures of RR variability to predict mortality 
      after myocardial infarction.
PG  - 927-34
AB  - BACKGROUND: We studied 715 patients 2 weeks after myocardial infarction to test the 
      hypothesis that short-term power spectral measures of RR variability (calculated 
      from 2 to 15 minutes of normal RR interval data) will predict all-cause mortality or 
      arrhythmic death. METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed power spectral analyses on the 
      entire 24-hour RR interval time series. To compare with the 24-hour analyses, we 
      selected short segments of ECG recordings from two time periods for analysis: 8 AM 
      to 4 PM and midnight to 5 AM. The former corresponds to the time interval during 
      which short-term measures of RR variability would most likely be obtained. The 
      latter, during sleep, represent a period of increased vagal tone, which may simulate 
      the conditions that exist when patients have a signal-averaged ECG recorded, ie, 
      lying quietly in the laboratory. Four frequency domain measures were calculated from 
      spectral analysis of heart period data over a 24-hour interval. We computed the 
      24-hour power spectral density and calculated the power within three frequency 
      bands: (1) 0.0033 to < 0.04 Hz, very low frequency power, (2) 0.04 to < 0.15 Hz, low 
      frequency power, and (3) 0.15 to 0.40 Hz, high frequency power. In addition, we 
      calculated the ratio of low to high frequency power. These measures were calculated 
      for 15-, 10-, 5-, and 2-minute segments during the day and at night. Mean power 
      spectral values from short periods during the day and night were similar to 24-hour 
      values, and the correlations between short segment values and 24-hour values were 
      strong (many correlations were > or = 0.75). Using the optimal cutpoints determined 
      previously for the 24-hour power spectral values, we compared the survival 
      experience of patients with low values for RR variability in short segments of ECG 
      recordings to those with high values. We found that power spectral measures of RR 
      variability were excellent predictors of all-cause, cardiac, and arrhythmic 
      mortality and sudden death. Patients with low values were 2 to 4 times as likely to 
      die over an average follow-up of 31 months as were patients with high values. The 
      power spectral measures of RR variability did not predict arrhythmic or sudden 
      deaths substantially better than all-cause mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Power spectral 
      measures of RR variability calculated from short (2 to 15 minutes) ECG recordings 
      are remarkably similar to those calculated over 24 hours. The power spectral 
      measures of RR variability are excellent predictors of all-cause mortality and 
      sudden cardiac death.

      free-living conditions--a pilot study.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: A number of small portable systems that can measure HRV are available to 
      address questions related to autonomic regulation in free-living subjects. However, 
      ambulatory HRV measurements obtained through use of these systems have not 
      previously been validated against standard clinical measurements such as Holter 
      recordings. The objective of this study was to validate HRV obtained using a 
      commonly used system, Actiheart, during occupational and leisure-time activities. 
      METHOD: Full-day ambulatory electrocardiography (ECG) signals were recorded from 8 
      females simultaneously using Actiheart and Holter recorders, and signals were 
      processed to RR-interval time series. Segments of 5-minute duration were sampled 
      every 30 minutes, and spectral components of the heart rate variability were 
      calculated. Actiheart and Holter values were compared using Deming regression 
      analysis and Bland-Altman plots. RESULTS: In total, 489 segments were available with 
      an HRV value from both Actiheart and Holter recordings after filtering out segments 
      with >10% interpolated beats. No systematic differences between Actiheart and Holter 
      HRV were found. The random deviations between Actiheart and Holter were comparable 
      to the repeatability standard deviation between consecutive Holter measurements. 
      DISCUSSION: The results show that Actiheart is suited as a stand-alone ambulatory 
      method for heart rate variability monitoring during occupational and leisure-time 
      activities.

AB  - This paper addresses the challenge of extracting meaningful information from 
      measured bioelectric signals generated by complex, large scale physiological systems 
      such as the brain or the heart. We focus on a combination of the well-known 
      Laplacian eigenmaps machine learning approach with dynamical systems ideas to 
      analyze emergent dynamic behaviors. The method reconstructs the abstract dynamical 
      system phase-space geometry of the embedded measurements and tracks changes in 
      physiological conditions or activities through changes in that geometry. It is 
      geared to extract information from the joint behavior of time traces obtained from 
      large sensor arrays, such as those used in multiple-electrode ECG and EEG, and 
      explore the geometrical structure of the low dimensional embedding of moving time 
      windows of those joint snapshots. Our main contribution is a method for mapping 
      vectors from the phase space to the data domain. We present cases to evaluate the 
      methods, including a synthetic example using the chaotic Lorenz system, several sets 
      of cardiac measurements from both canine and human hearts, and measurements from a 
      human brain.

AB  - This study investigates ECG features, focusing on T-wave amplitude, from a wearable 
      ECG device as a potential method for fitness monitoring in exercise rehabilitation. 
      An automatic T-peak detection algorithm is presented that uses local baseline 
      detection to overcome baseline drift without the need for preprocessing, and offers 
      adequate performance on data recorded in noisy environments. The algorithm is 
      applied to 24 hour data recordings from two subject groups with different physical 
      activity histories. Results indicate that, while mean heart rate (HR) differs most 
      significantly between the groups, T-amplitude features could be useful depending on 
      the disparities in fitness level, and require further investigation on an individual 
      basis.

TI  - Automatic QRS complex detection using two-level convolutional neural network.
PG  - 13
LID - 10.1186/s12938-018-0441-4 [doi]
LID - 13
AB  - BACKGROUND: The QRS complex is the most noticeable feature in the electrocardiogram 
      (ECG) signal, therefore, its detection is critical for ECG signal analysis. The 
      existing detection methods largely depend on hand-crafted manual features and 
      parameters, which may introduce significant computational complexity, especially in 
      the transform domains. In addition, fixed features and parameters are not suitable 
      for detecting various kinds of QRS complexes under different circumstances. METHODS: 
      In this study, based on 1-D convolutional neural network (CNN), an accurate method 
      for QRS complex detection is proposed. The CNN consists of object-level and 
      part-level CNNs for extracting different grained ECG morphological features 
      automatically. All the extracted morphological features are used by multi-layer 
      perceptron (MLP) for QRS complex detection. Additionally, a simple ECG signal 
      preprocessing technique which only contains difference operation in temporal domain 
      is adopted. RESULTS: Based on the MIT-BIH arrhythmia (MIT-BIH-AR) database, the 
      proposed detection method achieves overall sensitivity Sen = 99.77%, positive 
      predictivity rate PPR = 99.91%, and detection error rate DER = 0.32%. In addition, 
      the performance variation is performed according to different signal-to-noise ratio 
      (SNR) values. CONCLUSIONS: An automatic QRS detection method using two-level 1-D CNN 
      and simple signal preprocessing technique is proposed for QRS complex detection. 
      Compared with the state-of-the-art QRS complex detection approaches, experimental 
      results show that the proposed method acquires comparable accuracy.

TI  - Different Methods to Measure QRS Duration in CRT Patients: Impact on the Predictive 
      Value of QRS Duration Parameters.
PG  - 305-15
LID - 10.1111/anec.12313 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Measurements of QRS duration (QRSD) in patients undergoing cardiac 
      resynchronization therapy (CRT) are not standardized. We hypothesized that both the 
      measurement of QRSD and its predictive value on CRT response are sensitive to the 
      method by which QRSD is measured. METHODS: Electrocardiograms (ECGs) pre- and 
      post-CRT from 52 CRT patients (66 ± 12 years, 65% male) were retrospectively 
      analyzed. Custom-made software was developed to measure global QRSD (QRSDglobal ) 
      and lead-specific QRSD (QRSDI,II,III,aVR,aVL,aVF,V1,V2,V3,V4,V5,V6 ). QRSD was also 
      assessed automatic by a routinely used ECG device. For each method we measured QRSD 
      pre- and post-CRT and shortening of QRSD (∆QRSD). Response to CRT at 6 months was 
      defined as an improvement of ≥1 class in New York Heart Association classification 
      and an increase by >7.5% in left ventricular ejection fraction. RESULTS: The CRT 
      response rate was 77% (n = 40). Different methods to measure QRSD show divergent 
      nominal values before (median range 152-172 ms, P < 0.001) and after CRT (130-152 
      ms, P < 0.001). The predictive value of QRSD measurements for CRT response also 
      varies significantly according to the method used (range AUC pre-CRT QRSD 
      0.400-0.580, P < 0.05; AUC post-CRT QRSD 0.447-0.768, P < 0.05; AUC ΔQRSD 
      0.540-0.858, P < 0.05). Global QRSD measurements revealed lower variability compared 
      to lead-specific QRSD. CONCLUSION: Different methods to measure QRSD yield not only 
      different nominal values but also influence the value of QRSD in predicting CRT 
      response. Measuring QRSD by a global method can help to standardize QRSD 
      measurements in future studies.

PG  - 133-42
LID - 10.1007/s00421-010-1478-7 [doi]
AB  - Heart rate variability analysis is a dynamic method to estimate the autonomic 
      control over the cardiac cycle. Although dysfunction in this control system may 
      appear spontaneously, other deficits may require provocation of the system. In this 
      article we describe a non-invasive method to perturb the autonomic influences on the 
      cardiac cycle. We recorded the ECG and respiratory pressure of ten healthy 
      volunteers while introducing a random forced oscillation pressure wave onto 
      spontaneous respiration. The heart period time series was determined and the power 
      spectra for the 0.05-0.15, 0.15-0.3 and 0.05-0.4 Hz bands were calculated. The 
      random input did not alter mean heart rate. However, the segments with the forced 
      oscillation input demonstrated, on average, a tenfold increase in spectral power 
      averaged across all subjects, with a maximum observed effect of 100-fold increase in 
      power. This increase in power correlated with the respiratory frequency. This study 
      demonstrates that random noise ventilation, such as used in respiratory forced 
      oscillation impedance estimates, significantly alters the autonomic input to cardiac 
      cycle variability in wake subjects.

AB  - Cardiac monitoring is routinely performed on all adult patients in the immediate 
      postoperative period in the Phase I PACU, regardless of the surgery/procedure or 
      type of anesthesia given. This practice is based on the premise that there may be a 
      possibility of a postanesthesia arrhythmia or cardiac event that would need to be 
      recognized and treated. The purpose of this study was to explore whether routine 
      cardiac monitoring is a valid practice for healthy individuals (ASA I) or merely a 
      tradition of postanesthesia nursing care.

AB  - The analysis of heart rate variability (HRV) has been performed on long-term 
      electrocardiography (ECG) recordings (12~24 hours) and short-term recordings (2~5 
      minutes), which may not capture momentary change of HRV. In this study, we present a 
      new method to analyze the momentary HRV (mHRV). The ECG recordings were segmented 
      into a series of overlapped HRV analysis windows with a window length of 5 minutes 
      and different time increments. The performance of the proposed method in delineating 
      the dynamics of momentary HRV measurement was evaluated with four commonly used time 
      courses of HRV measures on both synthetic time series and real ECG recordings from 
      human subjects and dogs. Our results showed that a smaller time increment could 
      capture more dynamical information on transient changes. Considering a too short 
      increment such as 10 s would cause the indented time courses of the four measures, a 
      1-min time increment (4-min overlapping) was suggested in the analysis of mHRV in 
      the study. ECG recordings from human subjects and dogs were used to further assess 
      the effectiveness of the proposed method. The pilot study demonstrated that the 
      proposed analysis of mHRV could provide more accurate assessment of the dynamical 
      changes in cardiac activity than the conventional measures of HRV (without time 
      overlapping). The proposed method may provide an efficient means in delineating the 
      dynamics of momentary HRV and it would be worthy performing more investigations.

TI  - Moving toward automatic and standalone delineation of seismocardiogram signal.
PG  - 7163-6
LID - 10.1109/EMBC.2015.7320044 [doi]
AB  - The purpose of this research is to propose an algorithm that could accomplish 
      automatic delineation of the seismocardiogram (SCG) signal without using a reference 
      electrocardiogram R-wave. As a result, the SCG signal could be used, as a 
      stand-alone solution for many cardiovascular medical applications such as hemorrhage 
      detection, cardiac computed tomographic gating, cardiac resynchronization therapy, 
      hemodynamics estimations and diastolic timed vibration. Multiple envelopes were 
      derived from the seismocardiogram signal by using filtering and triple integration. 
      The first envelope is referred as the heart rate envelope, which has the 
      characteristics of having a period of exactly one cardiac cycle and its purpose is 
      to replace the ECG R-wave as a reference point. Our dataset is based on the lower 
      body negative pressure (LBNP) test that was conducted on 18 individuals, containing 
      21610 cardiac cycles. For 94% of the LBNP dataset, the aforementioned envelope 
      estimated heart rate within 3 beats per minute. Three different peaks of the SCG 
      signal are of our interest: isovolumic contraction (IM), aortic valve opening (AO) 
      and aortic valve closure (AC). For each of these desired peaks of the SCG signal, a 
      different envelope was designed in a manner that its peak is very close to IM, AO 
      and AC, respectively. For the same lower body negative pressure data set, a mean 
      difference of (9, 9, 6) and standard deviation of (8, 9, 9) millisecond between the 
      peak of envelopes and IM, AO and AC is accomplished. This could be used as a good 
      initial estimation of the annotation points.

LID - 10.1016/j.diii.2017.10.011 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to retrospectively assess the accuracy of the 
      maximal left atrial volume (LAV(max)) measured at 75% of the cardiac cycle compared 
      to the 40% measurements and to evaluate this volume according to age and gender. 
      PATIENTS AND METHOD: A total of 150 patients with a mean age of 50±17 (SD) years 
      (range: 21-79 years) were analyzed. There were 78 men and 72 women. LAV(max) were 
      measured from retrospective triphasic cardiac-gated multi-detector computed 
      tomography (MDCT) data at the 40% (LAV(40)) and 75% (LAV(75)) of the RR cycle phases 
      by a semi-automatic method. RESULTS: LAV(40)was 50.7±14mL/m(2) and LAV(75) was 
      42.5±13mL/m(2). The difference was statistically significant. Considering the 
      reference range of LAV(max) reported in the literature, 33% of the patients had 
      enlarged LA with LAV(40) and only 17% with LAV(75). These volumes were positively 
      influenced by age but not by gender. The relationship between LAV(75) and LAV(40) 
      was: LAV(75)=0.908 LAV(40)-3.486 (r(2)=0.92) or LAV(40)=1.1×LAV(75)+3.8 (r(2)=0.92). 
      CONCLUSION: LAV(max) measured at the 75% of the cardiac cycle phase significantly 
      underestimates actual LAV leading to reconsider normal values. LAV(40) can be 
      computed from the measured value of LAV(75) obtained on prospective ECG-gated MDCT.

AB  - One of the biggest challenges in averaging ECG or EEG signals is to overcome 
      temporal misalignments and distortions, due to uncertain timing or complex 
      non-stationary dynamics. Standard methods average individual leads over a collection 
      of epochs on a time-sample by time-sample basis, even when multi-electrode signals 
      are available. Here we propose a method that averages multi electrode recordings 
      simultaneously by using spatial patterns and without relying on time or frequency.

AB  - It is significant to establish scene ECG database which improves the automatic 
      diagnostic function of electrocardiograph under different application scenarios. We 
      built the ECG database in different scene according to the hospital level (grade 3, 
      grade 2, grade 1) and clinical environment (intensive care and acute wards, 
      outpatient clinics and general wards). Sample size was obtained according to the 
      incidence of various ECG diagnoses. The database covers ECG signal, ECG waveform, 
      ECG characteristic values, ECG diagnostic results by experts and clinical 
      information of patients etc. It not only provides important reference for 
      electrocardiograph manufacturers to evaluate and test the parameters of automatic 
      diagnosis under different clinical scene, but also provides valuable scientific 
      research and teaching resources for medical workers.

TI  - Atrial Fibrillation Beat Identification Using the Combination of Modified Frequency 
      Slice Wavelet Transform and Convolutional Neural Networks.

AB  - Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a serious cardiovascular disease with the phenomenon of 
      beating irregularly. It is the major cause of variety of heart diseases, such as 
      myocardial infarction. Automatic AF beat detection is still a challenging task which 
      needs further exploration. A new framework, which combines modified frequency slice 
      wavelet transform (MFSWT) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), was proposed for 
      automatic AF beat identification. MFSWT was used to transform 1 s electrocardiogram 
      (ECG) segments to time-frequency images, and then, the images were fed into a 
      12-layer CNN for feature extraction and AF/non-AF beat classification. The results 
      on the MIT-BIH Atrial Fibrillation Database showed that a mean accuracy (Acc) of 
      81.07% from 5-fold cross validation is achieved for the test data. The corresponding 
      sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp), and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) results 
      are 74.96%, 86.41%, and 0.88, respectively. When excluding an extremely poor signal 
      quality ECG recording in the test data, a mean Acc of 84.85% is achieved, with the 
      corresponding Se, Sp, and AUC values of 79.05%, 89.99%, and 0.92. This study 
      indicates that it is possible to accurately identify AF or non-AF ECGs from a 
      short-term signal episode.

AB  - To observe the effect of sub-hypothermia (HT) blood purification technique in the 
      treatment of cardiac shock after heart valve disease.The patients were randomly 
      divided into normothermic (NT) continuous blood purification (CBP) group (NT group) 
      and HT CBP group (HT group). Observe the cardiac index (CI), the oxygen delivery 
      (DO2) and oxygen consumption (VO2) ratio, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health 
      Evaluation III(APACHE III) score, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) score, 
      dynamic monitoring of electrocardiograph, blood loss with or without muscle tremors, 
      intensive care unit stay, mechanical ventilation time, CBP time, and the cases of 
      infection and mortality at 0 day, 1 day, 2 day, 3 day; all above indicators were 
      compared between 2 groups.Ninety-five patients were randomly assigned into HT group 
      (48 cases) and NT group (47 cases); there were no significant differences between 
      the 2 groups for age, gender, pre-operative cardiac function, cardiothoracic ratio, 
      and type of valve replacement (P > .05). There were no significant differences among 
      the 1 day, 2 day, 3 day after recruited for CI, DO2/VO2 ratio, APACHE III score, 
      MODS score (P > .05). But in HT group, DO2/VO2 ratio had been significantly improved 
      after treatment for 1 day (2.5 ± 0.7 vs 1.8 ± 0.4, P = .024), and CI (3.0 ± 0.5 vs 
      1.9 ± 0.7, P = .004), APACHE III score (50.6 ± 6.2 vs 77.5 ± 5.5 P = .022), MODS 
      score (6.0 ± 1.5 vs 9.3 ± 3.4, P = .013) also had been significantly improved after 
      treatment for 3 days. In clinical outcomes, there were no significant differences 
      between 2 groups for blood loss (617.0 ± 60.7 ml vs 550.9 ± 85.2 ml, P = .203), 
      infection ratio (54.17% vs 53.19%, P = .341), the incidence of ventricular 
      arrhythmia (31.25% vs 36.17%, P = .237), and muscle tremors (14.58% vs 8.51%, 
      P = .346), while there were significant differences between 2 groups for intensive 
      care unit stay (6.9 ± 3.4 days vs 12.5 ± 3.5 days, P = .017,), mechanical 
      ventilation time (4.2 ± 1.3 days vs 7.5 ± 2.7 days, P = .034,), CBP time (4.6 ± 1.4 
      days vs 10.5 ± 4.0 days, P = .019), mortality (12.50% vs 23.40%, P = .024). But the 
      incidence of bradycardia in HT group was much higher than the NT group (29.16% vs 
      14.89%, P = .029).HT blood purification is a safer and more effective treatment than 
      NT blood purification for patients who suffered from cardiac shock after valve 
      surgery.

TI  - Cardiac resuscitation events: one eyewitness is not enough.
PG  - 335-42
LID - 10.1097/PCC.0000000000000355 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the accuracy of paper cardiopulmonary resuscitation records. 
      DESIGN: Case series. SETTING: Twenty-six-bed video-monitored pediatric cardiac ICU. 
      PATIENTS: All patients who had a resuscitation event with available video and 
      electronically stored vital sign and waveform data from May 2012 to February 2013. 
      INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: There were 41 cardiopulmonary 
      resuscitation events during the study period. Fifteen had complete and valid data 
      from the paper cardiopulmonary resuscitation forms, the retrieved monitor data, and 
      the continuous bedside video monitoring. These 15 events occurred in 12 individual 
      patients, and there was 100% agreement of data in the documentation of interventions 
      in place (ventilation, arterial catheter, pulse oximetry, and vascular access) and 
      in the presence of a witness at the onset of the arrest. All events were witnessed. 
      Of the 15 events, video and monitor review revealed that 14 used waveform and 
      numeric capnometry to confirm endotracheal tube/tracheostomy placement, but this 
      section was only completed on the paper cardiopulmonary resuscitation record in 
      three of the 14 cases. All records showed no discrepancies in the time of return of 
      spontaneous circulation. The video and monitor review revealed delay in initiating 
      cardiopulmonary resuscitation (mode, 2 min; two cases ≥ 7 min) and shockable rhythms 
      (ventricular arrhythmia) in two cases. A sign of pulseless state was discovered in 
      seven cases classified on the paper record as "always with a pulse." Those include 
      sudden loss of consciousness, flat arterial line tracing, and abrupt drop in the 
      partial pressure of exhaled carbon dioxide tracing (< 10 mm Hg). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Eyewitness accounts of cardiopulmonary resuscitation are often inaccurate and 
      incomplete. Review of information from video and electronically stored vital sign 
      and waveform data provides more accurate information than review of paper-based 
      cardiopulmonary resuscitation records and may provide the insight necessary to 
      improving cardiopulmonary resuscitation.

LID - 10.1109/MC.2019.2932716 [doi]
AB  - The automatic and unsupervised analysis of biomedical time series is of primary 
      importance for diagnostic and preventive medicine, enabling fast and reliable data 
      processing to reveal clinical insights without the need for human intervention. 
      Representation learning (RL) methods perform an automatic extraction of meaningful 
      features that can be used, e.g., for a subsequent classification of the measured 
      data. The goal of this study is to explore and quantify the benefits of RL 
      techniques of varying degrees of complexity, focusing on modern deep learning (DL) 
      architectures. We focus on the automatic classification of atrial fibrillation (AF) 
      events from noisy single-lead electrocardiographic signals (ECG) obtained from 
      wireless sensors. This is an important task as it allows the detection of 
      sub-clinical AF which is hard to diagnose with a short in-clinic 12-lead ECG. The 
      effectiveness of the considered architectures is quantified and discussed in terms 
      of classification performance, memory/data efficiency and computational complexity.

AB  - Hypertension (HT) is an extreme increment in blood pressure that can prompt a 
      stroke, kidney disease, and heart attack. HT does not show any symptoms at the early 
      stage, but can lead to various cardiovascular diseases. Hence, it is essential to 
      identify it at the beginning stages. It is tedious to analyze electrocardiogram 
      (ECG) signals visually due to their low amplitude and small bandwidth. Hence, to 
      avoid possible human errors in the diagnosis of HT patients, an automated ECG-based 
      system is developed. This paper proposes the computerized segregation of low-risk 
      hypertension (LRHT) and high-risk hypertension (HRHT) using ECG signals with an 
      optimal orthogonal wavelet filter bank (OWFB) system. The HRHT class is comprised of 
      patients with myocardial infarction, stroke, and syncope ECG signals. The ECG-data 
      are acquired from physionet's smart health for accessing risk via ECG event (SHAREE) 
      database, which contains recordings of a total 139 subjects. First, ECG signals are 
      segmented into epochs of 5 min. The segmented epochs are then decomposed into six 
      wavelet sub-bands (WSBs) using OWFB. We extract the signal fractional dimension 
      (SFD) and log-energy (LOGE) features from all six WSBs. Using Student's t-test 
      ranking, we choose the high ranked WSBs of LOGE and SFD features. We develop a novel 
      hypertension diagnosis index (HDI) using two features (SFD and LOGE) to discriminate 
      LRHT and HRHT classes using a single numeric value. The performance of our developed 
      system is found to be encouraging, and we believe that it can be employed in 
      intensive care units to monitor the abrupt rise in blood pressure while screening 
      the ECG signals, provided this is tested with an extensive independent database.

TI  - EVALUATION OF RADIATION ABSORBED DOSE AND IMAGE QUALITY IN DIFFERENT 
      RETROSPECTIVE-ECG GATING ACQUISITION METHODS OF CARDIAC CT ANGIOGRAPHY.
PG  - 304-309
LID - 10.1093/rpd/ncx111 [doi]
AB  - Cardiac computed tomography angiography (CCTA) studies have risen concern of 
      radiobiological effects over the patients. Therefore, estimating radiation doses 
      absorbed during CCTA is important. In this study, we compared radiation dose and 
      image quality by using three different retrospective electrocardiography (ECG) 
      protocols. A total of 123 patients undergoing CCTA were divided in three different 
      groups. We used full-dose modulation (CareDose4D) technique in group (1); fixed tube 
      current 200 mAs for group (2); and in group (3), chest circumference was used to 
      adapt tube current (180-200 mAs) and tube potential (100-120 kVp). For groups (1) 
      and (2), tube potential adapted depends on body mass index (BMI) in which it was 100 
      kVp for BMI < 27 kg/m2, and 120 kVp for BMI ≥ 27 kg/m2. Quantitive assessment of 
      image quality was calculated by measuring signal intensity (SI) and image noise (IN) 
      in the proximal segments of aorta root on left and right coronary arteries. 
      Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) were also calculated 
      by using SI and IN. Two experienced radiologists using a 4-point scale assessed the 
      subjective image quality. Our results show that in group (1), the mean effective 
      dose was 4.46 mSv (range: 1.75-8.6 mSv) and for group (2), the mean effective 
      radiation dose was 5.07 mSv (range: 2.57-9.74 mSv) and in group (3), the mean 
      effective dose was 5.85 mSv (range: 3.36-12.17 mSv). Group (1) representing 12% and 
      23% decrease in radiation dose comparing by groups (2) and (3). In multivariate 
      analysis, adjusting for BMI, radiation dose for patients with BMI < 27 kg/m2 was 
      significantly different; 2.53 mSv for group (1) compared to 3.54 mSv in group (2) 
      and 5.207 in group (3) (p < 0.0001). In addition, lowering tube potential from 120 
      to 100 kVp in 200 mAs fixed tube current, represents 27% decrease in radiation dose. 
      The quantitative image quality (IN, SI, SNR and CNR) was not statistically 
      significant among the groups. To sum up, Retrospective-ECG gating may reduce 
      radiation dose by using automatic tube current modulation and 100kVp tube potential 
      with preservation of image quality in patient's whose BMI < 27 kg/m2.

TI  - Pseudo-real-time low-pass filter in ECG, self-adjustable to the frequency spectra of 
      the waves.
PG  - 1579-1588
LID - 10.1007/s11517-017-1625-y [doi]
AB  - The electrocardiogram (ECG) acquisition is often accompanied by high-frequency 
      electromyographic (EMG) noise. The noise is difficult to be filtered, due to 
      considerable overlapping of its frequency spectrum to the frequency spectrum of the 
      ECG. Today, filters must conform to the new guidelines (2007) for low-pass filtering 
      in ECG with cutoffs of 150 Hz for adolescents and adults, and to 250 Hz for 
      children. We are suggesting a pseudo-real-time low-pass filter, self-adjustable to 
      the frequency spectra of the ECG waves. The filter is based on the approximation 
      procedure of Savitzky-Golay with dynamic change in the cutoff frequency. The filter 
      is implemented pseudo-real-time (real-time with a certain delay). An additional 
      option is the automatic on/off triggering, depending on the presence/absence of EMG 
      noise. The analysis of the proposed filter shows that the low-frequency components 
      of the ECG (low-power P- and T-waves, PQ-, ST- and TP-segments) are filtered with a 
      cutoff of 14 Hz, the high-power P- and T-waves are filtered with a cutoff frequency 
      in the range of 20-30 Hz, and the high-frequency QRS complexes are filtered with 
      cutoff frequency of higher than 100 Hz. The suggested dynamic filter satisfies the 
      conflicting requirements for a strong suppression of EMG noise and at the same time 
      a maximal preservation of the ECG high-frequency components.

TI  - Real-time multi-signal frequency tracking with a bank of notch filters to estimate 
      the respiratory rate from the ECG.
PG  - 1573-87
LID - 10.1088/0967-3334/37/9/1573 [doi]
AB  - Measuring the instantaneous frequency of a signal rapidly and accurately is 
      essential in many applications. However, the instantaneous frequency by definition 
      is a parameter difficult to determine. Fourier-based methods introduce estimation 
      delays as computations are performed in a time-window. Instantaneous methods based 
      on the Hilbert transform lack robustness. State-of-the-art adaptive filters yield 
      accurate estimates, however, with an adaptation delay. In this study we propose an 
      algorithm based on short length-3 FIR notch filters to estimate the instantaneous 
      frequency of a signal at each sample, in a real-time manner and with very low delay. 
      The output powers of a bank of the above-mentioned filters are used in a recursive 
      weighting scheme to estimate the dominant frequency of the input. This scheme has 
      been extended to process multiple inputs containing a common frequency by 
      introducing an additional weighting scheme upon the inputs. The algorithm was tested 
      on synthetic data and then evaluated on real biomedical data, i.e. the estimation of 
      the respiratory rate from the electrocardiogram. It was shown that the proposed 
      method provided more accurate estimates with less delay than those of 
      state-of-the-art methods. By virtue of its simplicity and good performance, the 
      proposed method is a worthy candidate to be used in biomedical applications, for 
      example in health monitoring developments based on portable and automatic devices.

TI  - ECG-based pulse detection during cardiac arrest using random forest classifier.
PG  - 453-462
LID - 10.1007/s11517-018-1892-2 [doi]
AB  - Sudden cardiac arrest is one of the leading causes of death in the industrialized 
      world. Pulse detection is essential for the recognition of the arrest and the 
      recognition of return of spontaneous circulation during therapy, and it is therefore 
      crucial for the survival of the patient. This paper introduces the first method 
      based exclusively on the ECG for the automatic detection of pulse during 
      cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Random forest classifier is used to efficiently 
      combine up to nine features from the time, frequency, slope, and regularity analysis 
      of the ECG. Data from 191 cardiac arrest patients was used, and 1177 ECG segments 
      were processed, 796 with pulse and 381 without pulse. A leave-one-patient out cross 
      validation approach was used to train and test the algorithm. The statistical 
      distributions of sensitivity (SE) and specificity (SP) for pulse detection were 
      estimated using 500 patient-wise bootstrap partitions. The mean (std) SE/SP for 
      nine-feature classifier was 88.4 (1.8) %/89.7 (1.4) %, respectively. The designed 
      algorithm only requires 4-s-long ECG segments and could be integrated in any 
      commercial automated external defibrillator. The method permits to detect the 
      presence of pulse accurately, minimizing interruptions in cardiopulmonary 
      resuscitation therapy, and could contribute to improve survival from cardiac arrest.

TI  - Estimation of the Blood Pressure Waveform using Electrocardiography().
PG  - 7060-7063
LID - 10.1109/EMBC.2019.8856399 [doi]
AB  - This work presents a modelling approach to accurately predict the blood pressure 
      (BP) waveform time series from a single input signal. A nonlinear autoregressive 
      model with exogenous input (NARX) is implemented using artificial neural networks 
      and trained on Electrocardiography (ECG) signals to predict the BP waveform. The 
      efficacy of the model is demonstrated using the MIMIC II database. The proposed 
      method can accurately estimate systolic and diastolic BP. The NARX model together 
      with ECG measurement allows continuous monitoring of BP, enables the estimation of 
      other physiological measurements, such as the cardiac output, and provides more 
      insight on the patient health condition.

TI  - Heartbeat classification using morphological and dynamic features of ECG signals.
PG  - 2930-41
AB  - In this paper, we propose a new approach for heartbeat classification based on a 
      combination of morphological and dynamic features. Wavelet transform and independent 
      component analysis (ICA) are applied separately to each heartbeat to extract 
      morphological features. In addition, RR interval information is computed to provide 
      dynamic features. These two different types of features are concatenated and a 
      support vector machine classifier is utilized for the classification of heartbeats 
      into one of 16 classes. The procedure is independently applied to the data from two 
      ECG leads and the two decisions are fused for the final classification decision. The 
      proposed method is validated on the baseline MIT-BIH arrhythmia database and it 
      yields an overall accuracy (i.e., the percentage of heartbeats correctly classified) 
      of 99.3% (99.7% with 2.4% rejection) in the "class-oriented" evaluation and an 
      accuracy of 86.4% in the "subject-oriented" evaluation, comparable to the 
      state-of-the-art results for automatic heartbeat classification.

TI  - Automatic Cardiac Self-Gating of Small-Animal PET Data.
PG  - 109-16
LID - 10.1007/s11307-015-0868-y [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The cardiac gating signal (CGS) in positron emission tomography (PET) 
      studies is usually obtained from an electrocardiography (ECG) monitor. In this work, 
      we propose a method to obtain the CGS in small-animal PET using the acquired 
      list-mode data without using any hardware or end-user input. PROCEDURES: The CGS was 
      obtained from the number of coincidences over time acquired in the lines-of-response 
      connected with the cardiac region. This region is identified in the image as its 
      value changes with frequencies in the range of 3 to 12 Hz. The procedure was tested 
      in a study with 29 Wistar rats and 6 mice injected with 
      2-deoxy-2-[(18)F]fluoro-D-glucose, which underwent a 45-min single-bed list-mode PET 
      scan of the heart syncronized with an ECG. The estimated signals and the 
      reconstructed images using eight-gated frames were compared with the ones obtained 
      using the ECG signal from the monitor. RESULTS: The differences of the PET-based CGS 
      with respect to the ECG relative to the duration of the heartbeats were 5.6 % in 
      rats and 11.0 % in mice. The reconstructed gated images obtained from the proposed 
      method do not differ qualitatively with respect to the ones obtained with the ECG. 
      The quantitative analysis of both set of images were performed measuring the volume 
      of the left ventricle (LV) of the rats in the end-of-systole and end-of-diastole 
      phase. The differences found in these parameters between both methods were below 
      12.1 % in the ESV and 9.3 % in the EDV with a 95 % confidence interval, which are 
      comparable to the accuracy (7 %) of the method used for segmenting the LV. 
      CONCLUSION: The proposed method is able to provide a valid and accurate CGS in 
      small-animal PET list-mode data.

LID - e0127168
AB  - PURPOSE: We investigated incidence, risk factors for new-onset atrial fibrillation 
      (NAF), and prognostic impact during septic shock in medical Intensive Care Unit 
      (ICU) patients. METHODS: Prospective, observational study in a university hospital. 
      Consecutive patients from 03/2011 to 05/2013 with septic shock were eligible. 
      Exclusion criteria were age <18 years, history of AF, transfer with prior septic 
      shock. Included patients were equipped with long-duration (7 days) Holter ECG 
      monitoring. NAF was defined as an AF episode lasting >30 seconds. Patient 
      characteristics, infection criteria, cardiovascular parameters, severity of illness, 
      support therapies were recorded. RESULTS: Among 66 patients, 29(44%) developed NAF; 
      10 (34%) would not have been diagnosed without Holter ECG monitoring. NAF patients 
      were older, with more markers of heart failure (troponin and NT-pro-BNP), lower left 
      ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), longer QRS duration and more nonsustained 
      supra ventricular arrhythmias (<30s) on day 1 than patients who maintained sinus 
      rhythm. By multivariate analysis, age (OR: 1.06; p = 0.01) and LVEF<45% (OR: 13.01, 
      p = 0.03) were associated with NAF. NAF did not predict 28 or 90 day mortality. 
      CONCLUSIONS: NAF is common, especially in older patients, and is associated with low 
      ejection fraction. We did not find NAF to be independently associated with higher 
      mortality.

TI  - Chaotic dynamics in circulation with Tohoku University vibrating flow pump.
PG  - 119-23
AB  - For the development of a totally implantable ventricular assist system (VAS), we 
      have been developing the vibrating flow pump (VFP), which can generate oscillated 
      blood flow with a relative high frequency (10-50 Hz) for a totally implantable 
      system. In this study, the effects of left ventricular assistance with this unique 
      oscillated blood flow were analyzed by the use of nonlinear mathematics for 
      evaluation as the whole circulatory regulatory system, not as the decomposed parts 
      of the system. Left heart bypasses using the VFP from the left atrium to the 
      descending aorta were performed in chronic animal experiments using healthy adult 
      goats. The ECG, arterial blood pressure, VFP pump flow, and the flow of the 
      descending aorta were recorded in the data recorder during awake conditions and 
      analyzed in a personal computer system through an A-D convertor. By the use of 
      nonlinear mathematics, time series data were embedded into the phase space, the 
      Lyapunov numerical method, fractal dimension analysis, and power spectrum analysis 
      were performed to evaluate nonlinear dynamics. During left ventricular assistance 
      with the VFP, Mayer wave fluctuations were decreased in the power spectrum, the 
      fractal dimension of the hemodynamics was significantly decreased, and peripheral 
      vascular resistance was significantly decreased. These results suggest that 
      nonlinear dynamics, which mediate the cardiovascular dynamics, may be affected 
      during left ventricular (LV) bypass with oscillated flow. The decreased power of the 
      Mayer wave in the spectrum caused the limit cycle attractor of the hemodynamics and 
      decreased peripheral resistance. Decreased sympathetic discharges may be the origin 
      of the decreased Mayer wave and fractal dimension. These nonlinear dynamic analyses 
      may be useful to design optimal VAS control.

      Interrupted Time Series Design and Methods.
PG  - e10
LID - 10.2196/resprot.4802 [doi]
LID - e10
AB  - BACKGROUND: Most patients presenting to US Emergency Departments (ED) with chest 
      pain are hospitalized for comprehensive testing. These evaluations cost the US 
      health system >$10 billion annually, but have a diagnostic yield for acute coronary 
      syndrome (ACS) of <10%. The history/ECG/age/risk factors/troponin (HEART) Pathway is 
      an accelerated diagnostic protocol (ADP), designed to improve care for patients with 
      acute chest pain by identifying patients for early ED discharge. Prior efficacy 
      studies demonstrate that the HEART Pathway safely reduces cardiac testing, while 
      maintaining an acceptably low adverse event rate. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this 
      study is to determine the effectiveness of HEART Pathway ADP implementation within a 
      health system. METHODS: This controlled before-after study will accrue adult 
      patients with acute chest pain, but without ST-segment elevation myocardial 
      infarction on electrocardiogram for two years and is expected to include 
      approximately 10,000 patients. Outcomes measures include hospitalization rate, 
      objective cardiac testing rates (stress testing and angiography), length of stay, 
      and rates of recurrent cardiac care for participants. RESULTS: In pilot data, the 
      HEART Pathway decreased hospitalizations by 21%, decreased hospital length (median 
      of 12 hour reduction), without increasing adverse events or recurrent care. At the 
      writing of this paper, data has been collected on >5000 patient encounters. The 
      HEART Pathway has been fully integrated into health system electronic medical 
      records, providing real-time decision support to our providers. CONCLUSIONS: We 
      hypothesize that the HEART Pathway will safely reduce healthcare utilization. This 
      study could provide a model for delivering high-value care to the 8-10 million US ED 
      patients with acute chest pain each year. CLINICALTRIAL: Clinicaltrials.gov

PG  - 165-9
AB  - Spectral analysis of heart rate variability has recently been shown to be a reliable 
      noninvasive test for quantitative assessment of cardiovascular automatic regulatory 
      responses. In 12 ambulant normotensive healthy young males (mean age 23 +/- 1 years) 
      after a period of 10 min. for stabilisation, a continuous ecg recording (lead CM-5) 
      for 8 min. was obtained in the supine and standing position, with a controlled 
      respiration rate 15/min. Power spectrum of 512 point time series (R-R intervals) in 
      both positions was calculated using a fast Fourier transform-based window 
      periodogram method. Based upon results from the literature the power spectrum 
      analysis was performed on two components: low frequency LF (0.05-0.15 Hz) and high 
      frequency HF (0.15-0.50 Hz). Mean R-R interval decreased on standing position from 
      0.79 +/- 0.10 s to 0.59 +/- 0.11 s (p less than 0.001). The ratio HF/LF in supine 
      was 0.63 +/- 0.70 and on standing position 2.54 +/- 0.73 (p less than 0.001). The 
      relative LF component of the total HR power spectrum increased from 22.8% +/- 12.1% 
      to 42.9 +/- 14.4% (p less than 0.001) after changing the position from supine to 
      standing, and the relative HF component decreased from 56.3 +/- 22.4% to 25.5 +/- 
      16.2 (p less than 0.001). The total power was significantly lower when standing in 
      comparison to supine position (681 +/- 519 s2, 1188 +/- 963 s2 respectively, p less 
      than 0.05). Our results suggest that heart rate fluctuations in supine position in 
      normal men are mainly vagally determined (HF power spectrum component).(ABSTRACT

AB  - AIMS: automatic detection of the QRS complex on electrocardiogram (ECG) is used on 
      cardiac ultrasound scanners to separate ultrasound image series into cardiac cycles 
      for playback and storage. On small hand-held scanners it is unpractical to connect 
      ECG cables. We therefore aim to do automatic cardiac cycle separation using apical 
      B-mode ultrasound images. METHODS AND RESULTS: cardiac cycle length is estimated by 
      cyclicity analysis of B-mode intensities. To determine a cycle start estimate near 
      QRS, a deformable model is fitted to the left ventricle in real-time. The model is 
      used to initialize and constrain a speckle tracker positioned near the mitral 
      annulus. In the displacement curve generated by the speckle tracker, a time point 
      near maximum distance from the probe is detected as a cardiac cycle start estimate. 
      Validation against ECG was done on 233 recordings from normal subjects and 46 
      recordings from subjects with coronary pathology. Several test cases were run for 
      each recording to emulate B-mode series starting at all time points in the cardiac 
      cycle. Totally, 11 886 test cases were run. Cycle length estimation was feasible in 
      98% of normal subject cases and 91% of pathology cases. Median difference in cycle 
      length by ECG was 0 and -3 ms, respectively. Cycle start estimation was feasible in 
      90% of normal subject cases and 77% of pathology cases. Median difference to cycle 
      start by ECG was 62 and 76 ms, respectively. CONCLUSION: apical B-mode series can 
      automatically be separated into cardiac cycles without using ECG.

TI  - Efficient and robust ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation detection method for 
      wearable cardiac health monitoring devices.
PG  - 239-246
AB  - In this Letter, the authors propose an efficient and robust method for automatically 
      determining the VT and VF events in the electrocardiogram (ECG) signal. The proposed 
      method consists of: (i) discrete cosine transform (DCT)-based noise suppression; 
      (ii) addition of bipolar sequence of amplitudes with alternating polarity; (iii) 
      zero-crossing rate (ZCR) estimation-based VTVF detection; and (iv) peak-to-peak 
      interval (PPI) feature based VT/VF discrimination. The proposed method is evaluated 
      using 18,000 episodes of different ECG arrhythmias taken from 6 PhysioNet databases. 
      The method achieves an average sensitivity (Se) of 99.61%, specificity (Sp) of 
      99.96%, and overall accuracy (OA) of 99.92% in detecting VTVF and non-VTVF episodes 
      by using a ZCR feature. Results show that the method achieves a Se of 100%, Sp of 
      99.70% and OA of 99.85% for discriminating VT from VF episodes using PPI features 
      extracted from the processed signal. The robustness of the method is tested using 
      different kinds of ECG beats and various types of noises including the baseline 
      wanders, powerline interference and muscle artefacts. Results demonstrate that the 
      proposed method with the ZCR, PPI features can achieve significantly better 
      detection rates as compared with the existing methods.

AB  - Balloon floatation pulmonary artery catheters (PACs) have been used for hemodynamic 
      monitoring in cardiac, medical, and surgical intensive care units since the 1970s. 
      With the availability of newer noninvasive diagnostic modalities, particularly 
      echocardiography, the frequency of diagnostic pulmonary artery catheterization has 
      declined. In this review, the evolution of PACs, the results of nonrandomized and 
      randomized studies in various clinical conditions, the uses and abuses of bedside 
      hemodynamic monitoring, and current indications for pulmonary artery catheterization 
      are discussed.

TI  - Automatic pattern recognition in ECG time series.
PG  - 109-15
AB  - In this paper, a technique for the automatic detection of any recurrent pattern in 
      ECG time series is introduced. The wavelet transform is used to obtain a 
      multiresolution representation of some example patterns for signal structure 
      extraction. Neural Networks are trained with the wavelet transformed templates 
      providing an efficient detector even for temporally varying patterns within the 
      complete time series. The method is also robust against offsets and stable for 
      signal to noise ratios larger than one. Its reliability was tested on 60 Holter ECG 
      recordings of patients at the Department of Cardiology (University of Bonn). Due to 
      the convincing results and its fast implementation the method can easily be used in 
      clinical medicine. In particular, it solves the problem of automatic P wave 
      detection in Holter ECG recordings.

TI  - Electrocardiogram, hemodynamics, and core body temperatures of the normal freely 
      moving laboratory beagle dog by remote radiotelemetry.
PG  - 128-39
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The objectives of this study were to provide baseline normative values 
      for circadian changes in the time-series data collected over the course of a normal 
      day in laboratory-housed dogs and to assess the relative efficiency of standard 
      correction formulas to correct for the variations in QT intervals and heart rate 
      functions. METHODS: One hundred and twenty-three beagle dogs (65 M, 58 F) were 
      equipped with radiotelemetry transmitters and continuously monitored, while freely 
      moving in their home cages. Electrocardiograms (ECGs), hemodynamic parameters 
      (diastolic, systolic, and mean arterial pressures) as well as core body temperatures 
      were recorded for 22 h. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Blood pressures and core body 
      temperatures demonstrated only very slight variations in their respective values 
      over the 22-h monitoring period. ECGs were measured by a computerized waveform 
      analysis program and quantitative elements reported as RR, PR, QRS, and QT 
      intervals. Little circadian rhythmicity was demonstrated in the ECG intervals. 
      Standard study-specific correction formulas appeared to satisfactorily normalize 
      (i.e., compensate for) the relationship between heart rate and QT intervals in these 
      beagle dogs but elevated the values of the QTc as compared to the uncorrected QT 
      intervals. In sharp contrast, a subject-specific correction method based on analysis 
      of covariance produced a more linear function between heart rates and QT intervals 
      and, more importantly, provided QTc values within the normal range of actual, 
      recorded QT interval data.

TI  - False alarms during patient monitoring in clinical intensive care units are highly 
      related to poor quality of the monitored electrocardiogram signals.
PG  - 1383-91
LID - 10.1088/0967-3334/37/8/1383 [doi]
AB  - Electrocardiograms (ECGs) recorded from patients in intensive care were investigated 
      to quantify any relationship between ECG signal quality and false monitoring alarms. 
      False alarms are a considerable problem for nursing and medical staff as they 
      distract from clinical care, and are also a problem for patients as they disturb 
      rest, which is important for clinical recovery. ECG and alarm data were obtained for 
      750 patient alarms from the PhysioNet database. The final 8 s period before the 
      alarm was triggered was investigated. All but one ECG channel in 38 ECG recordings 
      with out-of-range data were associated with false positive alarms (p  <  0.0001). 
      The frequency contributions for baseline (BL) instability, electromyogram (EMG) 
      muscle noise, and high frequency (HF) noise were calculated. For all three frequency 
      bands, the contributions associated with false positive alarms were very 
      significantly greater than for true positive alarms (p  <  0.0001). The greatest 
      difference was for BL with a mean level for false positive alarms 4.0 times greater 
      than for true positive alarms, followed by EMG and HF at 1.6 times and 1.4 times 
      respectively. These results confirm that attention needs to be taken to improve ECG 
      signal quality to reduce the frequency of clinical false alarms, and hence improve 
      conditions for clinical staff and patients.

AB  - High false alarm rates in the ICU decrease quality of care by slowing staff response 
      times while increasing patient delirium through noise pollution. The 2015 
      PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge provides a set of 1250 multi-parameter 
      ICU data segments associated with critical arrhythmia alarms, and challenges the 
      general research community to address the issue of false alarm suppression using all 
      available signals. Each data segment was 5 minutes long (for real time analysis), 
      ending at the time of the alarm. For retrospective analysis, we provided a further 
      30 seconds of data after the alarm was triggered. A total of 750 data segments were 
      made available for training and 500 were held back for testing. Each alarm was 
      reviewed by expert annotators, at least two of whom agreed that the alarm was either 
      true or false. Challenge participants were invited to submit a complete, working 
      algorithm to distinguish true from false alarms, and received a score based on their 
      program's performance on the hidden test set. This score was based on the percentage 
      of alarms correct, but with a penalty that weights the suppression of true alarms 
      five times more heavily than acceptance of false alarms. We provided three example 
      entries based on well-known, open source signal processing algorithms, to serve as a 
      basis for comparison and as a starting point for participants to develop their own 
      code. A total of 38 teams submitted a total of 215 entries in this year's Challenge. 
      This editorial reviews the background issues for this challenge, the design of the 
      challenge itself, the key achievements, and the follow-up research generated as a 
      result of the Challenge, published in the concurrent special issue of Physiological 
      Measurement. Additionally we make some recommendations for future changes in the 
      field of patient monitoring as a result of the Challenge.

TI  - Monitoring cardiac function by accelerometer - detecting start systole from the 
      acceleration signal makes additional ECG recordings for R-peak detection redundant.
PG  - 4922-4925

AB  - A miniaturized accelerometer attached to the heart has been used for monitoring 
      functional parameters such as early systolic velocity and displacement. Currently, 
      processing of the accelerometer signal for derival of these functional parameters 
      depends on determining start systole by detecting the ECG R-peaks. This study 
      proposes an alternative method using only the accelerometer signal to detect start 
      systole, making additional ECG recordings for this purpose redundant. A signal 
      processing method for automatic detection of start systole by accelerometer alone 
      was developed and compared with detected R-peaks in 15 pigs during 5 different 
      interventions showing a difference of 30 ± 17 ms. Furthermore, the derived early 
      systolic velocity and displacement using only accelerometer measurements correlated 
      well (r(2)=0.91 and 0.82, respectively) with minor differences compared to the 
      current method using ECG R-peaks as time reference. The results show that an 
      accelerometer can be used to monitor cardiac function without the need to measure 
      ECG which can simplify the monitoring system.

TI  - Quasi-experimental study to improve nurses' QT-interval monitoring: results of QTIP 
      study.
PG  - 195-200; quiz 201
LID - 10.4037/ajcc2012245 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A collaboration led by the American Heart Association recently released 
      the scientific statement "Prevention of Torsade de Pointes in Hospital Settings." 
      Patients receiving proarrhythmic drugs, who have electrolyte disturbances, or who 
      have bradyarrhythmias require QT-interval monitoring. Prior studies have 
      demonstrated that physicians have a poor level of proficiency at calculating QT 
      intervals. The ability of nurses at calculating QT intervals remains untested. 
      OBJECTIVES: To evaluate nurses' knowledge and ability to perform QT/QTc interval 
      monitoring. METHODS: At a single institution, 47 QT-education classes were provided 
      to 480 eligible nurses who regularly perform cardiac monitoring. All nurses 
      completed a researcher-developed knowledge test at baseline and after the QT-related 
      education intervention. RESULTS: Overall 379 nurses participated (mean age 39 [SD, 
      10] years), 71% had more than 5 years' nursing experience. Total test scores 
      increased after intervention (46% vs 77%, P < .001). Education significantly 
      improved marking of the QT/RR intervals (QT: 65% vs 91%, RR: 83% vs 90%, P ≤ .001 
      and P = .02) and measurement of the QT/RR intervals (QT: 47% vs 84%, RR: 35% vs 71% 
      P ≤ .001 and P ≤ .001). Calculation of the QTc interval also increased significantly 
      (6% vs 52%, P ≤ .001). CONCLUSIONS: Our study results demonstrate that nurses' 
      baseline ability to perform QT interval monitoring is extremely poor. An 
      unacceptable amount of error persists after an educational intervention. Accurate 
      computer-assisted methods are needed to reduce the error associated with manual 
      QT-interval monitoring.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: In this work, we develop a fully automatic and real-time 
      ventricular heartbeat classifier based on a single ECG lead. Single ECG lead 
      classifiers can be especially useful for wearable technologies that provide 
      continuous and long-term monitoring of the electrocardiogram. These wearables 
      usually have a few non-standard leads and the quality of the signals depends on the 
      user physical activity. METHODS: The proposed method uses an Echo State Network 
      (ESN) to classify ECG signals following the Association for the Advancement of 
      Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) recommendations with an inter-patient scheme. To 
      achieve real-time classification, the classifier itself and the feature extraction 
      approach are fast and computationally efficient. In addition, our approach allows 
      transferring the knowledge from one database to another without additional training. 
      RESULTS: The classification performance of the proposed model is validated on the 
      MIT-BIH arrhythmia and INCART databases. The sensitivity and precision of the 
      proposed method for MIT-BIH arrhythmia database are 95.3 and 88.8 for the modified 
      lead II and 90.9 and 89.2 for the V1 lead. The results reported are further compared 
      to the existing methodologies in literature. Our methodology is a competitive single 
      lead ventricular heartbeat classifier, that is comparable to state-of-the-art 
      algorithms using multiple leads. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed fully automated, 
      single-lead and real-time heartbeat classifier of ventricular heartbeats reports an 
      improved classification accuracy in different leads of the evaluated databases in 
      comparison with other single lead heartbeat classifiers. These results open the 
      possibility of applying our methodology to wearable long-term monitoring devices 
      with an unconventional placement of the electrodes.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The search for objective clinical signs is a constant practitioners' and 
      researchers' concern in psychiatry. New technologies (embedded sensors, artificial 
      intelligence) give an easier access to untapped information such as passive data 
      (i.e. that do not require patient intervention). The concept of "digital phenotype" 
      is emerging in psychiatry: a psychomotor alteration translated by accelerometer's 
      modifications contrasting with the usual functioning of the subject, or the 
      graphorrhea of patients presenting a manic episode which is replaced by an increase 
      of SMS sent. Our main objective is to highlight the digital phenotype of mood 
      disorders by means of a selective review of the literature. METHOD: We conducted a 
      selective review of the literature by querying the PubMed database until February 
      2017 with the terms [Computer] [Computerized] [Machine] [Automatic] [Automated] 
      [Heart rate variability] [HRV] [actigraphy] [actimetry] [digital] [motion] 
      [temperature] [Mood] [Bipolar] [Depression] [Depressive]. Eight hundred and 
      forty-nine articles were submitted for evaluation, 37 articles were included. 
      RESULTS: For unipolar disorders, smartphones can diagnose depression with excellent 
      accuracy by combining GPS and call log data. Actigraphic measurements showing 
      daytime alteration in basal function while ECG sensors assessing variation in heart 
      rate variability (HRV) and body temperature appear to be useful tools to diagnose a 
      depressive episode. For bipolar disorders, systems which combine several sensors are 
      described: MONARCA, PRIORI, SIMBA and PSYCHE. All these systems combine passive and 
      active data on smartphones. From a synthesis of these data, a digital phenotype of 
      the disorders is proposed based on the accelerometer and the GPS, the ECG, the body 
      temperature, the use of the smartphone and the voice. This digital phenotype thus 
      brings into question certain clinical paradigms in which psychiatrists evolve. 
      CONCLUSION: All these systems can be used to computerize the clinical 
      characteristics of the various mental states studied, sometimes with greater 
      precision than a clinician could do. Most authors recommend the use of passive data 
      rather than active data in the context of bipolar disorders because automatically 
      generated data reduce biases and limit the feeling of intrusion that 
      self-questionnaires may cause. The impact of these technologies questions the 
      psychiatrist's professional culture, defined as a specific language and a set of 
      common values. We address issues related to these changes. Impact on psychiatrists 
      could be important because their unity seems to be questioned due to technologies 
      that profoundly modify the collect and process of clinical data.

      Analysis.
PG  - 131-138
LID - 10.1109/TCBB.2018.2846611 [doi]
AB  - In this work, arrhythmia appearing with the presence of abnormal heart electrical 
      activity is efficiently recognized and classified. A novel method is proposed for 
      accurate recognition and classification of cardiac arrhythmias. Firstly, P-QRS-T 
      waves is segmented from ECG waveform; secondly, morphological features are extracted 
      from P-QRS-T waves, and ECG segment features are extracted from the selected ECG 
      segment by using PCA and dynamic time warping(DTW); finally, SVM is applied to the 
      features and automatic diagnosis results is presented. ECG data set used is derived 
      from the MIT-BIH in which ECG signals are divided into the four classes: normal 
      beats(N), supraventricular ectopic beats (SVEBs), ventricular ectopic beats (VEBs) 
      and fusion of ventricular and normal (F). Our proposed method can distinguish N, 
      SVEBs, VEBs and F with an accuracy of 97.80 percent. The sensitivities for the 
      classes N, SVEBs, VEBs and F are 99.27, 87.47, 94.71, and 73.88 percent and the 
      positive predictivities are 98.48, 95.25, 95.22 and 86.09 percent respectively. The 
      detection sensitivity of SVEBs and VEBs has a better performance by combining 
      proposed features than by using the ECG morphology or ECG segment features 
      separately. The proposed method is compared with four selected peer algorithms and 
      delivers solid results.

TI  - Cardiac Arrest with Clozapine and Olanzapine: Revealing Long QT Syndrome.
AB  - The authors describe a rare case of "concealed" congenital Long QT Syndrome (LQTS) 
      Type 3 in a patient with treatment resistant schizophrenia and no known personal or 
      family history of cardiac disease. The patient in this Case Report had a hidden 
      genetic condition revealed only following the essential administration of 
      antipsychotics. As a result, this patient experienced an aborted cardiac arrest and 
      a total of five episodes of ventricular tachycardia (VT) requiring cardioversion. 
      Successful control of the VT occurred with an Automatic Internal Defibrillator 
      (AID), judicious use of antipsychotic medications, and anti-arrhythmic medications. 
      Risk factors for this rare anomaly include history of syncopy, unexplained 
      ventricular arrhythmias, history of sudden cardiac death in a young family member, 
      unusual reaction to initial dosages of medication known to prolong QTc which 
      includes antipsychotics (particularly in combination). The work-up for those with 
      risk factors would be a thorough family history of sudden cardiac death, baseline 
      ECG, electrolytes, cardiology and electrophysiological consultation, and when 
      indicated a genetic analysis for the Long QT Syndrome (LQTS). Monitoring includes 
      ongoing patient assessment for symptoms, ECGs and electrolytes when indicated such 
      as when medication and dosages are adjusted, AID interviewing, and cardiac and 
      electrophysiological follow-up.

TI  - Cardiorespiratory dynamics measured from continuous ECG monitoring improves 
      detection of deterioration in acute care patients: A retrospective cohort study.

LID - e0181448
AB  - BACKGROUND: Charted vital signs and laboratory results represent intermittent 
      samples of a patient's dynamic physiologic state and have been used to calculate 
      early warning scores to identify patients at risk of clinical deterioration. We 
      hypothesized that the addition of cardiorespiratory dynamics measured from 
      continuous electrocardiography (ECG) monitoring to intermittently sampled data 
      improves the predictive validity of models trained to detect clinical deterioration 
      prior to intensive care unit (ICU) transfer or unanticipated death. METHODS AND 
      FINDINGS: We analyzed 63 patient-years of ECG data from 8,105 acute care patient 
      admissions at a tertiary care academic medical center. We developed models to 
      predict deterioration resulting in ICU transfer or unanticipated death within the 
      next 24 hours using either vital signs, laboratory results, or cardiorespiratory 
      dynamics from continuous ECG monitoring and also evaluated models using all 
      available data sources. We calculated the predictive validity (C-statistic), the net 
      reclassification improvement, and the probability of achieving the difference in 
      likelihood ratio χ2 for the additional degrees of freedom. The primary outcome 
      occurred 755 times in 586 admissions (7%). We analyzed 395 clinical deteriorations 
      with continuous ECG data in the 24 hours prior to an event. Using only continuous 
      ECG measures resulted in a C-statistic of 0.65, similar to models using only 
      laboratory results and vital signs (0.63 and 0.69 respectively). Addition of 
      continuous ECG measures to models using conventional measurements improved the 
      C-statistic by 0.01 and 0.07; a model integrating all data sources had a C-statistic 
      of 0.73 with categorical net reclassification improvement of 0.09 for a change of 1 
      decile in risk. The difference in likelihood ratio χ2 between integrated models with 
      and without cardiorespiratory dynamics was 2158 (p value: <0.001). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Cardiorespiratory dynamics from continuous ECG monitoring detect clinical 
      deterioration in acute care patients and improve performance of conventional models 
      that use only laboratory results and vital signs.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Myocardial infarction (MI) is a myocardial anoxic 
      incapacitation caused by severe cardiovascular obstruction that can cause 
      irreversible injury or even death. In medical field, the electrocardiogram (ECG) is 
      a common and effective way to diagnose myocardial infarction, which often requires a 
      wealth of medical knowledge. It is necessary to develop an approach that can detect 
      the MI automatically. METHODS: In this paper, we propose a multi-branch fusion 
      framework for automatic MI screening from 12-lead ECG images, which consists of 
      multi-branch network, feature fusion and classification network. First, we use text 
      detection and position alignment to automatically separate twelve leads from ECG 
      images. Then, those 12 leads are input into the multi-branch network constructed by 
      a shallow neural network to get 12 feature maps. After concatenating those feature 
      maps by depth fusion, classification is explored to judge the given ECG is MI or 
      not. RESULTS: Based on extensive experiments on an ECG image dataset, performances 
      of different combinations of structures are analyzed. The proposed network is 
      compared with other networks and also compared with physicians in the practical use. 
      All the experiments verify that the proposed method is effective for MI screening 
      based on ECG images, which achieves accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and F1-score 
      of 94.73%, 96.41%, 95.94% and 93.79% respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Rather than using 
      the typical one-dimensional electrical ECG signal, this paper gives an effective 
      model to screen MI by analyzing 12-lead ECG images. Extracting and analyzing these 
      12 leads from their corresponding ECG images is a good attempt in the application of 
      MI screening.

TI  - Carotid and Jugular Classification in ARTSENS.
PG  - 440-9
LID - 10.1109/JBHI.2015.2403283 [doi]
AB  - Over past few years our group has been working on the development of a low-cost 
      device, ARTSENS, for measurement of local arterial stiffness (AS) of the common 
      carotid artery (CCA). This uses a single element ultrasound transducer to obtain 
      A-mode frames from the CCA. It is designed to be fully automatic in its operation 
      such that, a general medical practitioner can use the device without any prior 
      knowledge of ultrasound modality. Placement of the probe over CCA and identification 
      of echo positions corresponding to its two walls are critical steps in the process 
      of measurement of AS. We had reported an algorithm to locate the CCA walls based on 
      their characteristic motion. Unfortunately, in supine position, the internal jugular 
      vein (IJV) expands in the carotid triangle and pulsates in a manner that confounds 
      the existing algorithm and leads to wrong measurements of the AS. Jugular venous 
      pulse (JVP), on its own right, is a very important physiological signal for 
      diagnosis of morbidities of the right side of the heart and there is a lack of 
      noninvasive methods for its accurate estimation. We integrated an ECG device to the 
      existing hardware of ARTSENS and developed a method based on physiology of the 
      vessels, which now enable us to segregate the CCA pulse (CCP) and the JVP. False 
      identification rate is less than 4%. To retain the capabilities of ARTSENS to 
      operate without ECG, we designed another method where the classification can be 
      achieved without an ECG, albeit errors are a bit higher. These improvements enable 
      ARTSENS to perform automatic measurement of AS even in the supine position and make 
      it a unique and handy tool to perform JVP analysis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Heart rate variability (HRV) arises from the complex interplay of 
      sympathetic and parasympathetic autonomic regulation of heart rate. Ultra-low 
      frequency (ULF) and very-low frequency (VLF) components of HRV play a crucial role 
      in automatic HR controllers, but these frequency bands have hitherto largely been 
      neglected in HRV studies. The aim of this work was to investigate changes in ULF and 
      VLF heart rate variability with respect to exercise intensity and time during 
      treadmill running. METHODS: RR intervals were determined by ECG in 21 healthy male 
      participants at rest, and during moderate and vigorous-intensity treadmill running; 
      each of these three tests had a duration of 45 min. Time dependence of HRV was 
      investigated for moderate and vigorous running intensities by dividing the 
      constant-speed stages into three consecutive windows of equal duration ([Formula: 
      see text] 14 min), denoted [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text] and [Formula: 
      see text]. ULF and VLF power were computed using Lomb-Scargle power spectral density 
      estimates. RESULTS: For both the ULF and VLF frequency bands, mean power was 
      significantly different between the resting, moderate and vigorous intensity levels 
      (overall [Formula: see text]): mean power was lower for moderate vs. rest ([Formula: 
      see text]), for vigorous vs. rest ([Formula: see text]), and for vigorous vs. 
      moderate ([Formula: see text]). For both ULF and VLF and moderate intensity, mean 
      power was significantly different between the three time windows (overall [Formula: 
      see text] for ULF, overall [Formula: see text] for VLF): for ULF, mean power was 
      lower for [Formula: see text] vs. [Formula: see text] ([Formula: see text]) and for 
      [Formula: see text] vs. [Formula: see text] ([Formula: see text]); for VLF, mean 
      power was lower for [Formula: see text] vs. [Formula: see text] ([Formula: see 
      text]). For ULF and vigorous intensity, there was no significant difference in mean 
      power between the three time windows (overall [Formula: see text]). For VLF and 
      vigorous intensity, mean power was significantly different between [Formula: see 
      text], [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] (overall [Formula: see text]): 
      mean power was lower for [Formula: see text] vs. [Formula: see text] ([Formula: see 
      text]) and for [Formula: see text] vs. [Formula: see text] ([Formula: see text]). 
      CONCLUSIONS: The degree of HRV in terms of ULF and VLF power was found to decrease 
      with increasing intensity of exercise. HRV was also observed to decrease over time, 
      but it remains to clarify whether these changes are due to time itself or to 
      increases in HR related to cardiovascular drift. For feedback control applications, 
      attention should be focused on meeting performance targets at low intensity and 
      during the early stages of exercise.

AB  - This paper reviews the methods used for editing of the R-R interval time series and 
      how this editing can influence the results of heart rate (HR) variability analyses. 
      Measurement of HR variability from short and long-term electrocardiographic (ECG) 
      recordings is a non-invasive method for evaluating cardiac autonomic regulation. HR 
      variability provides information about the sympathetic-parasympathetic autonomic 
      balance. One important clinical application is the measurement of HR variability in 
      patients suffering from acute myocardial infarction. However, HR variability signals 
      extracted from R-R interval time series from ambulatory ECG recordings often contain 
      different amounts of artifact. These false beats can be either of physiological or 
      technical origin. For instance, technical artifact may result from poorly fastened 
      electrodes or be due to motion of the subject. Ectopic beats and atrial fibrillation 
      are examples of physiological artifact. Since ectopic and other false beats are 
      common in the R-R interval time series, they complicate the reliable analysis of HR 
      variability sometimes making it impossible. In conjunction with the increased usage 
      of HR variability analyses, several studies have confirmed the need for different 
      approaches for handling false beats present in the R-R interval time series. The 
      editing process for the R-R interval time series has become an integral part of 
      these analyses. However, the published literature does not contain detailed reviews 
      of editing methods and their impact on HR variability analyses. Several different 
      editing and HR variability signal pre-processing methods have been introduced and 
      tested for the artifact correction. There are several approaches available, i.e., 
      use of methods involving deletion, interpolation or filtering systems. However, 
      these editing methods can have different effects on HR variability measures. The 
      effects of editing are dependent on the study setting, editing method, parameters 
      used to assess HR variability, type of study population, and the length of R-R 
      interval time series. The purpose of this paper is to summarize these pre-processing 
      methods for HR variability signal, focusing especially on the editing of the R-R 
      interval time series.

AB  - Short-term cardiovascular regulation mediated by the sympathetic and parasympathetic 
      branches of the autonomic nervous system has been investigated by multivariate 
      autoregressive (MVAR) modeling, providing insightful analysis. MVAR models employ, 
      as inputs, heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP) and respiratory waveforms. 
      ECG (from which HR series is obtained) and respiratory flow waveform (RFW) can be 
      easily sampled from the patients. Nevertheless, the available methods for 
      acquisition of beat-to-beat SBP measurements during exams hamper the wider use of 
      MVAR models in clinical research. Recent studies show an inverse correlation between 
      pulse wave transit time (PWTT) series and SBP fluctuations. PWTT is the time 
      interval between the ECG R-wave peak and photoplethysmography waveform (PPG) base 
      point within the same cardiac cycle. This study investigates the feasibility of 
      using inverse PWTT (IPWTT) series as an alternative input to SBP for MVAR modeling 
      of the cardiovascular regulation. For that, HR, RFW, and IPWTT series acquired from 
      volunteers during postural changes and autonomic blockade were used as input of MVAR 
      models. Obtained results show that IPWTT series can be used as input of MVAR models, 
      replacing SBP measurements in order to overcome practical difficulties related to 
      the continuous sampling of the SBP during clinical exams.

TI  - Fractal rigidity by enhanced sympatho-vagal antagonism in heartbeat interval 
      dynamics elicited by central application of corticotropin-releasing factor in mice.
PG  - 830-74
AB  - The dynamics of heartbeat interval fluctuations were studied in awake unrestrained 
      mice following intracerebroventricular application of the neuropeptide 
      corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF). The cardiac time series derived from 
      telemetric ECG monitoring were analyzed by non-parametric techniques of nonlinear 
      signal processing: delay-vector variance (DVV) analysis, higher-order variability 
      (HOV) analysis, empirical mode decomposition (EMD), multiscale embedding-space 
      decomposition (MESD), multiexponent multifractal (MEMF) analysis. The analyses 
      support the conjecture that cardiac dynamics of normal control mice has both 
      deterministic and stochastic elements, is nonstationary, nonlinear, and exerts 
      multifractal properties. Central application of CRF results in bradycardia and 
      increased variability of the beat-to-beat fluctuations. The altered dynamical 
      properties elicited by CRF reflect a significant loss of intrinsic structural 
      complexity of cardiac control which is due to central neuroautonomic 
      hyperexcitation, i.e., enhanced sympatho-vagal antagonism. The change in dynamical 
      complexity is characterized by an effect referred to as fractal rigidity, leading to 
      a significant impairment of adaptability to extrinsic challenges in a fluctuating 
      environment. The impact of dynamical neurocardiopathy as a major precipiting factor 
      for the propensity of cardiac arrhythmias or sudden cardiac death by unchecked 
      central CRF release in significant acute life events in man is critically discussed.

TI  - Automatic motion and noise artifact detection in Holter ECG data using empirical 
      mode decomposition and statistical approaches.
PG  - 1499-506
LID - 10.1109/TBME.2011.2175729 [doi]
AB  - We present a real-time method for the detection of motion and noise (MN) artifacts, 
      which frequently interferes with accurate rhythm assessment when ECG signals are 
      collected from Holter monitors. Our MN artifact detection approach involves two 
      stages. The first stage involves the use of the first-order intrinsic mode function 
      (F-IMF) from the empirical mode decomposition to isolate the artifacts' dynamics as 
      they are largely concentrated in the higher frequencies. The second stage of our 
      approach uses three statistical measures on the F-IMF time series to look for 
      characteristics of randomness and variability, which are hallmark signatures of MN 
      artifacts: the Shannon entropy, mean, and variance. We then use the 
      receiver-operator characteristics curve on Holter data from 15 healthy subjects to 
      derive threshold values associated with these statistical measures to separate 
      between the clean and MN artifacts' data segments. With threshold values derived 
      from 15 training data sets, we tested our algorithms on 30 additional healthy 
      subjects. Our results show that our algorithms are able to detect the presence of MN 
      artifacts with sensitivity and specificity of 96.63% and 94.73%, respectively. In 
      addition, when we applied our previously developed algorithm for atrial fibrillation 
      (AF) detection on those segments that have been labeled to be free from MN 
      artifacts, the specificity increased from 73.66% to 85.04% without loss of 
      sensitivity (74.48%-74.62%) on six subjects diagnosed with AF. Finally, the 
      computation time was less than 0.2 s using a MATLAB code, indicating that real-time 
      application of the algorithms is possible for Holter monitoring.

TI  - Improved event interval reconstruction in synthetic electrocardiograms.
PG  - 900-3
LID - 10.1109/TBME.2008.2003088 [doi]
AB  - Mathematical models for synthesizing ECGs are important tools in providing 
      reproducible standard signals for biomedical signal processing research and 
      technology. The ECG synthesis model ECGsyn and its extensions are the state of the 
      art and realistically capture: 1) the ECG morphology; 2) the spectrum of heart rate 
      variability; and 3) QT-interval adaptation to heart rate. This paper demonstrates 
      ECGsyn's time-domain limitations at reconstructing an ECG time series from ECG wave 
      annotations. An alternative algorithm, ECGfm, is therefore presented that recreates 
      the event intervals with greater fidelity by applying the wave annotations as a 
      phase constraint. Results on data drawn from the Physionet Physobank QT database 
      demonstrate the improved performance of the ECGfm algorithm.

TI  - ECG signal analysis for the assessment of sleep-disordered breathing and sleep 
      pattern.
PG  - 135-44
LID - 10.1007/s11517-011-0853-9 [doi]
AB  - The diagnosis of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) usually relies on the analysis of 
      complex polysomnographic measurements performed in specialized sleep centers. 
      Automatic signal analysis is a promising approach to reduce the diagnostic effort. 
      This paper addresses SDB and sleep assessment solely based on the analysis of a 
      single-channel ECG recorded overnight by a set of signal analysis modules. The 
      methodology of QRS detection, SDB analysis, calculation of ECG-derived respiration 
      curves, and estimation of a sleep pattern is described in detail. SDB analysis 
      detects specific cyclical variations of the heart rate by correlation analysis of a 
      signal pattern and the heart rate curve. It was tested with 35 SDB-annotated ECGs 
      from the Apnea-ECG Database, and achieved a diagnostic accuracy of 80.5%. To 
      estimate sleep pattern, spectral parameters of the heart rate are used as stage 
      classifiers. The reliability of the algorithm was tested with 18 ECGs extracted from 
      visually scored polysomnographies of the SIESTA database; 57.7% of all 30 s epochs 
      were correctly assigned by the algorithm. Although promising, these results 
      underline the need for further testing in larger patient groups with different 
      underlying diseases.

      abnormalities in structural heart disease.
PG  - 643-655
LID - 10.1111/pace.13338 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Depolarization abnormalities are hardly detectable by standard 12-lead 
      electrocardiogram (ECG) in some patients. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the value of the 
      16-lead High-Definition (HD)-ECG machine to record conduction abnormalities 
      including Epsilon waves in patients with structural heart disease. METHODS: Tracings 
      with 12-lead ECG, 16-lead HD-ECG, and signal-averaged ECG were studied. RESULTS: (1) 
      Case of severe coronary artery disease (CAD): On 16-lead HD-ECG, a tiny intra-QRS 
      signal was noted in lead III, a prolonged P wave in lead II, and fragmentation on 
      top of lead aVL and lead aVF. Proper automatic measurement of the prolonged P wave 
      measuring 190 ms was noted. Signal-averaging by 16-lead HD-ECG in lead III showed 
      the intra-QRS fragmentation and P wave prolongation of 180 ms. (2) First patient 
      with arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (ARVD): Standard 12-lead ECG 
      indicated Epsilon waves in lead III, V2, V3, and inverted T waves in V1-V3. 16-lead 
      HD-ECG indicated QRS prolongation in lead II, III, aVL, aVF, V2, V3 as opposed to 
      V6, and low amplitudes of QRS complexes in V4R and V3R as a new possible sign of 
      ARVD. Notches in lead V2, widening of QRS complexes in all precordial leads, but 
      shorter QRS in V8-V9 are also considered as a potential new diagnostic sign of ARVD. 
      (3) Second ARVD patient: Notches at the end of the QRS in lead III and a negative 
      initial deflection of the QRS in V1 and V2 were detected by standard 12-lead ECG. On 
      16-lead HD-ECG, a more pronounced QRS fragmentation was visible. CONCLUSION: 16-lead 
      HD-ECG in both CAD and ARVD seems to be more sensitive than 12-lead ECG to record 
      electrocardiographic abnormalities.

TI  - ECG analysis using multiple instance learning for myocardial infarction detection.
PG  - 3348-56
LID - 10.1109/TBME.2012.2213597 [doi]
AB  - This paper presents a useful technique for totally automatic detection of myocardial 
      infarction from patients' ECGs. Due to the large number of heartbeats constituting 
      an ECG and the high cost of having all the heartbeats manually labeled, supervised 
      learning techniques have achieved limited success in ECG classification. In this 
      paper, we first discuss the rationale for applying multiple instance learning (MIL) 
      to automated ECG classification and then propose a new MIL strategy called latent 
      topic MIL, by which ECGs are mapped into a topic space defined by a number of topics 
      identified over all the unlabeled training heartbeats and support vector machine is 
      directly applied to the ECG-level topic vectors. Our experimental results on real 
      ECG datasets from the PTB diagnostic database demonstrate that, compared with 
      existing MIL and supervised learning algorithms, the proposed algorithm is able to 
      automatically detect ECGs with myocardial ischemia without labeling any heartbeats. 
      Moreover, it improves classification quality in terms of both sensitivity and 
      specificity.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Handheld ECG recorders may have algorithms which automatically inform 
      the user of presence of arrhythmia. The main objectives of this study were to 
      evaluate the accuracy of the arrhythmia diagnosis algorithm of Beurer ME90 recorder 
      to diagnose atrial fibrillation (AF)/flutter, and to evaluate whether recording 
      technique (finger versus precordial) affects diagnostic performance. METHODS: 
      Consecutive patients admitted at the cardiology ward of a tertiary care hospital 
      were enrolled. Handheld ECG recordings were performed by holding the device between 
      index fingers (lead I), and by applying it to the chest (modified V4, mV4), with 
      12‑lead ECGs serving as the gold standard for presence of arrhythmia. RESULTS: A 
      total of 127 patients were included. The automatic arrhythmia detection algorithm 
      identified all 16 cases of AF, but specificity was poor (62-77%, with slightly 
      better specificity of mV4 compared to lead I). Specificity improved to 84% (95% CI 
      76-91%) if both lead I and mV4 recordings had to be positive for diagnosis, with a 
      positive predictive value of 48% (95% CI 30-67%). Interpretation of the tracings by 
      an electrophysiologist was 100% specific. Atrial flutter with regular ventricular 
      response was however missed by automatic and manual interpretation. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      automatic arrhythmia algorithm of the BeurerME90 device has excellent sensitivity 
      for diagnosing AF, but with low specificity. Strategies such as first recording lead 
      I (more practical to perform), and in case of arrhythmia detection, confirming with 
      an mV4 recording, may be applied to reduce false positive readings requiring manual 
      confirmation by a healthcare professional.

TI  - Multiclass classification of obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea based on a 
      convolutional neural network from a single-lead electrocardiogram.
PG  - 065003

AB  - OBJECTIVE: In this paper, we propose a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based deep 
      learning architecture for multiclass classification of obstructive sleep apnea and 
      hypopnea (OSAH) using single-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings. OSAH is the 
      most common sleep-related breathing disorder. Many subjects who suffer from OSAH 
      remain undiagnosed; thus, early detection of OSAH is important. APPROACH: In this 
      study, automatic classification of three classes-normal, hypopnea, and apnea-based 
      on a CNN is performed. An optimal six-layer CNN model is trained on a training 
      dataset (45 096 events) and evaluated on a test dataset (11 274 events). The 
      training set (69 subjects) and test set (17 subjects) were collected from 86 
      subjects with length of approximately 6 h and segmented into 10 s durations. MAIN 
      RESULTS: The proposed CNN model reaches a mean [Formula: see text]-score of 93.0 for 
      the training dataset and 87.0 for the test dataset. SIGNIFICANCE: Thus, proposed 
      deep learning architecture achieved a high performance for multiclass classification 
      of OSAH using single-lead ECG recordings. The proposed method can be employed in 
      screening of patients suspected of having OSAH.

AB  - Using food as a stimuli is known to cause multiple psychophysiological reactions. 
      Heart rate variability (HRV) is common tool for assessing physiological reactions in 
      autonomic nervous system. However, the findings in HRV related to food stimuli have 
      not been consistent. In this paper the quick changes in HRV related to positive and 
      negative food and non-food visual stimuli are investigated. Electrocardiogram (ECG) 
      was measured from 18 healthy females while being stimulated with the pictures. 
      Subjects also filled Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire to determine their eating 
      behavior. The inter-beat-interval time series and the HRV parameters were extracted 
      from the ECG. The quick change in HRV parameters were studied by calculating the 
      change from baseline value (10 s window before stimulus) to value after the onset of 
      the stimulus (10 s window during stimulus). The paired t-test showed significant 
      difference between positive and negative food pictures but not between positive and 
      negative non-food pictures. All the HRV parameters decreased for positive food 
      pictures while they stayed the same or increased a little for negative food 
      pictures. The eating behavior characteristic cognitive restraint was negatively 
      correlated with HRV parameters that describe decreasing of heart rate.

TI  - Integration of Attributes from Non-Linear Characterization of Cardiovascular 
      Time-Series for Prediction of Defibrillation Outcomes.
PG  - e0141313
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0141313 [doi]
LID - e0141313
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The timing of defibrillation is mostly at arbitrary intervals during 
      cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR), rather than during intervals when the 
      out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OOH-CA) patient is physiologically primed for 
      successful countershock. Interruptions to CPR may negatively impact defibrillation 
      success. Multiple defibrillations can be associated with decreased 
      post-resuscitation myocardial function. We hypothesize that a more complete picture 
      of the cardiovascular system can be gained through non-linear dynamics and 
      integration of multiple physiologic measures from biomedical signals. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: Retrospective analysis of 153 anonymized OOH-CA patients who received at 
      least one defibrillation for ventricular fibrillation (VF) was undertaken. A machine 
      learning model, termed Multiple Domain Integrative (MDI) model, was developed to 
      predict defibrillation success. We explore the rationale for non-linear dynamics and 
      statistically validate heuristics involved in feature extraction for model 
      development. Performance of MDI is then compared to the amplitude spectrum area 
      (AMSA) technique. RESULTS: 358 defibrillations were evaluated (218 unsuccessful and 
      140 successful). Non-linear properties (Lyapunov exponent > 0) of the ECG signals 
      indicate a chaotic nature and validate the use of novel non-linear dynamic methods 
      for feature extraction. Classification using MDI yielded ROC-AUC of 83.2% and 
      accuracy of 78.8%, for the model built with ECG data only. Utilizing 10-fold 
      cross-validation, at 80% specificity level, MDI (74% sensitivity) outperformed AMSA 
      (53.6% sensitivity). At 90% specificity level, MDI had 68.4% sensitivity while AMSA 
      had 43.3% sensitivity. Integrating available end-tidal carbon dioxide features into 
      MDI, for the available 48 defibrillations, boosted ROC-AUC to 93.8% and accuracy to 
      83.3% at 80% sensitivity. CONCLUSION: At clinically relevant sensitivity thresholds, 
      the MDI provides improved performance as compared to AMSA, yielding fewer 
      unsuccessful defibrillations. Addition of partial end-tidal carbon dioxide (PetCO2) 
      signal improves accuracy and sensitivity of the MDI prediction model.

AB  - Automatic identification of biosignals is one of the more studied fields in 
      biomedical engineering. In this paper, we present an approach for the unsupervised 
      recognition of biomedical signals: Microelectrode Recordings (MER) and 
      Electrocardiography signals (ECG). The unsupervised learning is based in classic and 
      bayesian estimation theory. We employ gaussian mixtures models with two estimation 
      methods. The first is derived from the frequentist estimation theory, known as 
      Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. The second is obtained from bayesian 
      probabilistic estimation and it is called variational inference. In this framework, 
      both methods are used for parameters estimation of Gaussian mixtures. The mixtures 
      models are used for unsupervised pattern classification, through the responsibility 
      matrix. The algorithms are applied in two real databases acquired in Parkinson's 
      disease surgeries and electrocardiograms. The results show an accuracy over 85% in 
      MER and 90% in ECG for identification of two classes. These results are 
      statistically equal or even better than parametric (Naive Bayes) and nonparametric 
      classifiers (K-nearest neighbor).

TI  - Short- and long-term variations in non-linear dynamics of heart rate variability.
PG  - 400-9
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the study was to investigate the short- and long-term 
      variations in the non-linear dynamics of heart rate variability, and to determine 
      the relationships between conventional time and frequency domain methods and the 
      newer non-linear methods of characterizing heart rate variability. METHODS: Twelve 
      healthy subjects were investigated by 3-h ambulatory ECG recordings repeated on 3 
      separate days. Correlation dimension, non-linear predictability, mean heart rate, 
      and heart rate variability in the time and frequency domains were measured and 
      compared with the results from corresponding surrogate time series. RESULTS: A small 
      significant amount of non-linear dynamics exists in heart rate variability. 
      Correlation dimensions and non-linear predictability are relatively specific 
      parameters for each individual examined. The correlation dimension is inversely 
      correlated to the heart rate and describes mainly linear correlations. Non-linear 
      predictability is correlated with heart rate variability measured as the standard 
      deviation of the R-R intervals and the respiratory activity expressed as power of 
      the high-frequency band. The dynamics of heart rate variability changes suddenly 
      even during resting, supine conditions. The abrupt changes are highly reproducible 
      within the individual subjects. CONCLUSIONS: The study confirms that the correlation 
      dimension of the R-R intervals is mostly due to linear correlations in the R-R 
      intervals. A small but significant part is due to non-linear correlations between 
      the R-R intervals. The different measures of heart rate variability (correlation 
      dimension, average prediction error, and the standard deviation of the R-R 
      intervals) characterize different properties of the signal, and are therefore not 
      redundant measures. Heart rate variability cannot be described as a single chaotic 
      system. Instead heart rate variability consists of intertwined periods with 
      different non-linear dynamics. It is hypothesized that the heart rate is governed by 
      a system with multiple "strange" attractors.

TI  - Automatic Classification of Sedation Levels in ICU Patients Using Heart Rate 
      Variability.
PG  - e782-9
LID - 10.1097/CCM.0000000000001708 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the potential value of heart rate variability features for 
      automated monitoring of sedation levels in mechanically ventilated ICU patients. 
      DESIGN: Multicenter, pilot study. SETTING: Several ICUs at Massachusetts General 
      Hospital, Boston, MA. PATIENTS: Electrocardiogram recordings from 40 mechanically 
      ventilated adult patients receiving sedatives in an ICU setting were used to develop 
      and test the proposed automated system. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Richmond 
      Agitation-Sedation Scale scores were acquired prospectively to assess patient 
      sedation levels and were used as ground truth. Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale 
      scores were grouped into four levels, denoted "unarousable" (Richmond Agitation- 
      Sedation Scale = -5, -4), "sedated" (-3, -2, -1), "awake" (0), "agitated" (+1, +2, 
      +3, +4). A multiclass support vector machine algorithm was used for classification. 
      Classifier training and performance evaluations were carried out using leave-oneout 
      cross validation. An overall accuracy of 69% was achieved for discriminating between 
      the four levels of sedation. The proposed system was able to reliably discriminate 
      (accuracy = 79%) between sedated (Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale < 0) and 
      nonsedated states (Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale > 0). CONCLUSIONS: With further 
      refinement, the methodology reported herein could lead to a fully automated system 
      for depth of sedation monitoring. By enabling monitoring to be continuous, such 
      technology may help clinical staff to monitor sedation levels more effectively and 
      to reduce complications related to over- and undersedation.

PG  - 3881-4
AB  - Power spectral analysis of time series derived from the R-wave morphology of the ECG 
      was employed to identify a suitable lead configuration for the detection of 
      sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) using the electrocardiogram (ECG). 16 subjects (46 
      +/- 9.2 yrs, 8 males), who did not report problems during sleep, and 13 subjects 
      previously diagnosed with SDB (49 +/- 8.8 yrs, 7 males) underwent an overnight sleep 
      study at an accredited sleep center. Power values derived from the spectra of the 
      R-peaks envelope were tested for their sensitivity and specificity in discriminating 
      between epochs containing normal breathing from epochs containing SDB. Of the three 
      tested lead configurations using two parameters NB1 and NB2 derived from the power 
      spectrum, lead I produced the best results with a sensitivity of 92.8% and a 
      specificity of 88.0% for the case of parameter NB1 and a sensitivity of 85.7% and a 
      specificity of 76.0% for the case of parameter NB2.

TI  - Long QT Syndrome.
BTI - GeneReviews(®)
AB  - CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Long QT syndrome (LQTS) is a cardiac electrophysiologic 
      disorder, characterized by QT prolongation and T-wave abnormalities on the ECG that 
      are associated with tachyarrhythmias, typically the ventricular tachycardia torsade 
      de pointes (TdP). TdP is usually self-terminating, thus causing a syncopal event, 
      the most common symptom in individuals with LQTS. Such cardiac events typically 
      occur during exercise and emotional stress, less frequently during sleep, and 
      usually without warning. In some instances, TdP degenerates to ventricular 
      fibrillation and causes aborted cardiac arrest (if the individual is defibrillated) 
      or sudden death. Approximately 50% of untreated individuals with a pathogenic 
      variant in one of the genes associated with LQTS have symptoms, usually one to a few 
      syncopal events. While cardiac events may occur from infancy through middle age, 
      they are most common from the preteen years through the 20s. Some types of LQTS are 
      associated with a phenotype extending beyond cardiac arrhythmia. In addition to the 
      prolonged QT interval, associations include muscle weakness and facial dysmorphism 
      in Andersen-Tawil syndrome (LQTS type 7); hand/foot, facial, and neurodevelopmental 
      features in Timothy syndrome (LQTS type 8); and profound sensorineural hearing loss 
      in Jervell and Lange-Nielson syndrome. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: Diagnosis of LQTS is 
      established by prolongation of the QTc interval in the absence of specific 
      conditions known to lengthen it (for example, QT-prolonging drugs) and/or by 
      molecular genetic testing that identifies a diagnostic change (or changes) in one or 
      more of the 15 genes known to be associated with LQTS – of which KCNH2 (LQT2), KCNQ1 
      (locus name LQT1), and SCN5A (LQT3) are the most common. Approximately 20% of 
      families meeting clinical diagnostic criteria for LQTS do not have detectable 
      pathogenic variants in a known gene. LQTS associated with biallelic pathogenic 
      variants or heterozygosity for pathogenic variants in two different genes (i.e., 
      digenic pathogenic variants) is generally associated with a more severe phenotype 
      with longer QTc interval. MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Beta blocker 
      medication is the primary treatment for LQTS; possible implantable 
      cardioverter-defibrillators (ICD) and/or left cardiac sympathetic denervation (LCSD) 
      for those with beta-blocker-resistant symptoms, inability to take beta blockers, 
      and/or history of cardiac arrest. Sodium channel blockers can be useful as 
      additional pharmacologic therapy for patients with a QTc interval >500 ms. 
      Prevention of primary manifestations: Beta blockers are clinically indicated in all 
      asymptomatic individuals meeting diagnostic criteria, including those who have a 
      pathogenic variant on molecular testing and a normal QTc interval. In general, ICD 
      implantation is not indicated for individuals with LQTS who are asymptomatic and who 
      have not been tried on beta blocker therapy. Prophylactic ICD therapy can be 
      considered for individuals with LQTS who are asymptomatic but suspected to be at 
      very high risk (e.g., those with ≥2 pathogenic variants on molecular testing). 
      Surveillance: Regular assessment of beta blocker dose for efficacy and adverse 
      effects in all individuals with LQTS, especially children during rapid growth; 
      regular periodic evaluations of ICDs for inappropriate shocks and pocket or lead 
      complications. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Drugs that cause further prolongation 
      of the QT interval or provoke torsade de pointes; competitive sports / activities 
      associated with intense physical activity and/or emotional stress for most 
      individuals. Evaluation of relatives at risk: Presymptomatic diagnosis and treatment 
      is warranted in relatives at risk to prevent syncope and sudden death. Other: For 
      some individuals, availability of automatic external defibrillators at home, at 
      school, and in play areas. GENETIC COUNSELING: LQTS is typically inherited in an 
      autosomal dominant manner. An exception is LQTS associated with sensorineural 
      deafness (known as Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome), which is inherited in an 
      autosomal recessive manner. Most individuals diagnosed with LQTS have an affected 
      parent. The proportion of LQTS caused by a de novo pathogenic variant is small. Each 
      child of an individual with autosomal dominant LQTS has a 50% risk of inheriting the 
      pathogenic variant. Penetrance of the disorder may vary. Prenatal testing for 
      pregnancies at increased risk and preimplantation genetic diagnosis are possible 
      once the pathogenic variant(s) have been identified in the family.

AB  - PURPOSE: To explore changes in stimulant utilization and pre-treatment 
      electrocardiography (ECG) screening in response to cardiovascular (CV) safety 
      concerns. METHODS: Two source populations were established from Florida Medicaid 
      Fee-for-service beneficiaries between 2001 and 2008: approximately 44 571 newly 
      diagnosed attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder patients and 33 000 new stimulant 
      users. Time-series design and Joinpoint analysis were used to describe monthly trend 
      changes in stimulant initiation, persistence, dosing, and pre-treatment ECG 
      screening. RESULTS: Initial and maintenance daily dose declined 6 mg (95% confidence 
      interval [CI] -14 to -1.9) methylphenidate (MPH) equivalent dose from a steady 27 mg 
      after Canada withdrew Adderall XR in February 2005; the trend rebounded to a daily 
      dose of 23 mg, after the remarketing of Adderall XR and a debate in the US over 
      issuing a boxed warning on stimulant CV safety in early 2006. Monthly initiation 
      increased 3.9% (CI -1.0 to 9.1) after the boxed warning debate to 54 per 100 
      patients per month (CI 44 to 68), but declined 2.4% (CI -3.6 to -1.2) after 
      requirement of medication guides in February 2007. Monthly ECG screening increased 
      3.2% (CI 2.3 to 4.2) after Adderall XR withdrawal and further increased 13% (CI 4 to 
      23) after the American Heart Association recommended pre-treatment ECG screening to 
      40 per 100 patients per month (CI 17 to 48). CONCLUSIONS: The first signal of 
      stimulant CV safety concerns was followed by varying responses depending on the 
      outcome measure used, suggesting that patients and physicians responded at different 
      times after the publicity of safety concerns. Clinical consequences of the changes 
      are uncertain. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI  - A decision support system for real-time stress detection during virtual reality 
      exposure.
PG  - 114-20
AB  - Virtual Reality (VR) is increasingly being used in combination with 
      psycho-physiological measures to improve assessment of distress in mental health 
      research and therapy. However, the analysis and interpretation of multiple 
      physiological measures is time consuming and requires specific skills, which are not 
      available to most clinicians. To address this issue, we designed and developed a 
      Decision Support System (DSS) for automatic classification of stress levels during 
      exposure to VR environments. The DSS integrates different biosensor data (ECG, 
      breathing rate, EEG) and behavioral data (body gestures correlated with stress), 
      following a training process in which self-rated and clinical-rated stress levels 
      are used as ground truth. Detected stress events for each VR session are reported to 
      the therapist as an aggregated value (ranging from 0 to 1) and graphically displayed 
      on a diagram accessible by the therapist through a web-based interface.

TI  - Beat-to-beat systolic time-interval measurement from heart sounds and ECG.
PG  - 177-94
LID - 10.1088/0967-3334/33/2/177 [doi]
AB  - Systolic time intervals are highly correlated to fundamental cardiac functions. 
      Several studies have shown that these measurements have significant diagnostic and 
      prognostic value in heart failure condition and are adequate for long-term patient 
      follow-up and disease management. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of 
      using heart sound (HS) to accurately measure the opening and closing moments of the 
      aortic heart valve. These moments are crucial to define the main systolic timings of 
      the heart cycle, i.e. pre-ejection period (PEP) and left ventricular ejection time 
      (LVET). We introduce an algorithm for automatic extraction of PEP and LVET using HS 
      and electrocardiogram. PEP is estimated with a Bayesian approach using the signal's 
      instantaneous amplitude and patient-specific time intervals between 
      atrio-ventricular valve closure and aortic valve opening. As for LVET, since the 
      aortic valve closure corresponds to the start of the S2 HS component, we base LVET 
      estimation on the detection of the S2 onset. A comparative assessment of the main 
      systolic time intervals is performed using synchronous signal acquisitions of the 
      current gold standard in cardiac time-interval measurement, i.e. echocardiography, 
      and HS. The algorithms were evaluated on a healthy population, as well as on a group 
      of subjects with different cardiovascular diseases (CVD). In the healthy group, from 
      a set of 942 heartbeats, the proposed algorithm achieved 7.66 ± 5.92 ms absolute PEP 
      estimation error. For LVET, the absolute estimation error was 11.39 ± 8.98 ms. For 
      the CVD population, 404 beats were used, leading to 11.86 ± 8.30 and 17.51 ± 17.21 
      ms absolute PEP and LVET errors, respectively. The results achieved in this study 
      suggest that HS can be used to accurately estimate LVET and PEP.

AB  - Rapid automatic detection of the fiducial points-namely, the P wave, QRS complex, 
      and T wave-is necessary for early detection of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). In 
      this paper, we present an R peak detection method using the wavelet transform (WT) 
      and a modified Shannon energy envelope (SEE) for rapid ECG analysis. The proposed 
      WTSEE algorithm performs a wavelet transform to reduce the size and noise of ECG 
      signals and creates SEE after first-order differentiation and amplitude 
      normalization. Subsequently, the peak energy envelope (PEE) is extracted from the 
      SEE. Then, R peaks are estimated from the PEE, and the estimated peaks are adjusted 
      from the input ECG. Finally, the algorithm generates the final R features by 
      validating R-R intervals and updating the extracted R peaks. The proposed R peak 
      detection method was validated using 48 first-channel ECG records of the MIT-BIH 
      arrhythmia database with a sensitivity of 99.93%, positive predictability of 99.91%, 
      detection error rate of 0.16%, and accuracy of 99.84%. Considering the high 
      detection accuracy and fast processing speed due to the wavelet transform applied 
      before calculating SEE, the proposed method is highly effective for real-time 
      applications in early detection of CVDs.

TI  - Development and validation of a phase analysis tool to measure interventricular 
      mechanical dyssynchrony from gated SPECT MPI.
PG  - 1680-1686
LID - 10.1007/s12350-016-0503-6 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study is to develop a right-ventricular (RV) phase 
      analysis tool which when coupled with our left ventricular (LV) phase analysis tool 
      can provide measurement of the interventricular mechanical dyssynchrony from gated 
      SPECT myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI), and validate the tool by 
      electrocardiography (ECG). METHODS: For each patient, short-axis LV and RV SPECT MPI 
      images were input into an automatic sampling algorithm to generate the 3D maximal 
      count circumferential profiles for both LV and RV in each cardiac frame. 
      Subsequently, the samples of LV and RV were separately used by our phase analysis 
      tool based on the first-harmonic Fourier approximation to calculate the contraction 
      onset for each sample. The difference between contraction onsets of the middle LV 
      free wall and middle LV septal wall represented the LV contraction delay; the 
      difference between contraction onsets of the middle RV free wall and middle RV 
      septal wall represented the RV contraction delay. The difference between the LV and 
      RV contraction delays represented the interventricular contraction delay, which was 
      compared with the interventricular conduction delay classified by ECG to validate 
      the concordance of interventricular mechanical and electrical dyssynchrony. 
      Sixty-one bundle branch block (BBB) patients with ischemic-dilated cardiomyopathy 
      (26, 42.6%) or non-ischemic-dilated cardiomyopathy (35, 57.4%), who underwent 
      12-lead surface ECG and gated resting Tc-99m sestamibi SPECT, were retrospectively 
      analyzed in this study. RESULTS: In the 30 patients with left bundle branch block 
      (LBBB) by ECG, there were 27 patients whose LV contracted later than the RV 
      according to SPECT; and in the 31 patients with right bundle branch block (RBBB) by 
      ECG, there were 26 patients whose LV contracted earlier than the RV according to 
      SPECT. In total, an agreement rate of 86.9% (53 of 61) was achieved between SPECT 
      and ECG. The Kappa agreement rate was 73.8% (95% confidence interval 0.57-0.91). 
      CONCLUSION: The preliminary results showed promise for the measurement of 
      interventricular mechanical dyssynchrony in BBB patients with dilated cardiomyopathy 
      using our phase analysis tool.

AB  - The aim of this case study was to evaluate electrocardiographic diagnosis of Brugada 
      syndrome. Our study involved a 43-year old man of Indian origin coming for 
      consultation due to acute chest pain. The patient suffered from untreated stage 2 
      hypertension and had a family history of sudden death (his father died at the age of 
      40 years). ECG showed an incomplete right bundle-branch block with descendant 
      displacement of the ST segment dome-shaped at right precordial level; coronary 
      angiography was normal, which led us to the diagnosis of type I Brugada syndrome. 
      The patient underwent implantation of an implantable automatic defibrillator in 
      Reunion Island and regular follow-up.

AB  - Özsoylu S, Akyıldız BN, Dursun A, Pamukçu Ö. Could you say that was an atrial 
      flutter or not? Turk J Pediatr 2019; 61: 608-610. Muscle-tremor artefact is a 
      potential cause of misdiagnosis of atrial arrhythmias on electrocardiography (ECG) 
      monitoring. Such errors may lead to inappropriate and potentially dangerous 
      therapies in some patients. We present a case of a patient with uncontrolled 
      seizures whose bedside electrocardiogram monitor analysis appeared to demonstrate 
      atrial flutter with 4:1 conduction through the AV node. The ECG monitor and ECG 
      rhythm strip additionally showed a regular ventricular rate of 94 bpm with an 
      underlying regular `saw-tooth` baseline. We applied cardioversion to convert to 
      sinus rhythm. Amiodarone was loaded and added to the patients therapy who had atrial 
      flutter after cardioversion. Echocardiogram was performed by a pediatric 
      cardiologist and they noted that the atrial rate and ventricular rate were equal. 
      After this, we began to suspect this situation might be a pseudoflutter due to his 
      muscle contractions. We applied rocuronium to the patient to understand whether this 
      was a pseudo-flutter or not. We saw that the ECG returned to normal sinus rhythm. 
      Physicians especially working in intensive care units should be aware of artifact to 
      avoid unnecessary therapeutic procedures. As Hippocrates said centuries ago `First, 
      do no harm.`.

TI  - Projective filtering of time warped ECG beats.
PG  - 127-37
AB  - The paper proposes a modification of the nonlinear state-space projections (NSSP) 
      method. Our approach, when applied to ECG signal processing, considerably improves 
      the method's performance. One of the crucial operations in NSSP is the search for 
      neighborhoods of the state-space trajectory points. The modification proposed is 
      based on imposing a few restrictions on the time location of the neighborhood 
      points. Dynamic time warping, a technique which allows for nonlinear alignment of 
      time series or sequences of vectors, is applied as a straightforward solution to the 
      task of neighborhoods determination with the restrictions imposed. The influence of 
      nonlinear alignment on the distributions of the determined neighborhoods is 
      presented, and the resulting method of ECG enhancement is investigated.

TI  - Classification of ictal and seizure-free HRV signals with focus on lateralization of 
      epilepsy.
PG  - 43-56
LID - 10.3233/THC-151072 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Epileptic onsets often affect the autonomic function of the body during a 
      seizure, whether it is in ictal, interictal or post-ictal periods. The different 
      effects of localization and lateralization of seizures on heart rate variability 
      (HRV) emphasize the importance of autonomic function changes in epileptic patients. 
      On the other hand, the detection of seizures is of primary interests in evaluating 
      the epileptic patients. In the current paper, we analyzed the HRV signal to develop 
      a reliable offline seizure-detection algorithm to focus on the effects of 
      lateralization on HRV. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We assessed the HRV during 5-min 
      segments of continuous electrocardiogram (ECG) recording with a total number of 170 
      seizures occurred in 16 patients, composed of 86 left-sided and 84 right-sided focus 
      seizures. Relatively high and low-frequency components of the HRV were computed 
      using spectral analysis. Poincaré parameters of each heart rate time series 
      considered as non-linear features. We fed these features to the Support Vector 
      Machines (SVMs) to find a robust classification method to classify epileptic and 
      non-epileptic signals. Leave One Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV) approach was used to 
      demonstrate the consistency of the classification results. RESULTS: Our obtained 
      classification accuracy confirms that the proposed scheme has a potential in 
      classifying HRV signals to epileptic and non-epileptic classes. The accuracy rates 
      for right-sided and left-sided focus seizures were obtained as 86.74% and 79.41%, 
      respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The main finding of our study is that the patients with 
      right-sided focus epilepsy showed more reduction in parasympathetic activity and 
      more increase in sympathetic activity. It can be a marker of impaired vagal activity 
      associated with increased cardiovascular risk and arrhythmias. Our results suggest 
      that lateralization of the seizure onset zone could exert different influences on 
      heart rate changes. A right-sided seizure would cause an ictal tachycardia whereas a 
      left-sided seizure would result in an ictal bradycardia.

TI  - [Analysis of pacemaker ECGs].
PG  - 260-73
LID - 10.1007/s00399-015-0383-5 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The key to a successful analysis of a pacemaker electrocardiogram 
      (ECG) is the application of the systematic approach used for any other ECG without a 
      pacemaker: analysis of (1) basic rhythm and rate, (2) QRS axis, (3) PQ, QRS and QT 
      intervals, (4) morphology of P waves, QRS, ST segments and T(U) waves and (5) the 
      presence of arrhythmias. METHODS: If only the most obvious abnormality of a 
      pacemaker ECG is considered, wrong conclusions can easily be drawn. If a systematic 
      approach is skipped it may be overlooked that e.g. atrial pacing is ineffective, the 
      left ventricle is paced instead of the right ventricle, pacing competes with 
      intrinsic conduction or that the atrioventricular (AV) conduction time is programmed 
      too long. Apart from this analysis, a pacemaker ECG which is not clear should be 
      checked for the presence of arrhythmias (e.g. atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, 
      junctional escape rhythm and endless loop tachycardia), pacemaker malfunction (e.g. 
      atrial or ventricular undersensing or oversensing, atrial or ventricular loss of 
      capture) and activity of specific pacing algorithms, such as automatic mode 
      switching, rate adaptation, AV delay modifying algorithms, reaction to premature 
      ventricular contractions (PVC), safety window pacing, hysteresis and noise mode. 
      CONCLUSION: A systematic analysis of the pacemaker ECG almost always allows a 
      probable diagnosis of arrhythmias and malfunctions to be made, which can be 
      confirmed by pacemaker control and can often be corrected at the touch of the right 
      button to the patient's benefit.

AB  - The present study aimed to compare linear and symbolic dynamics (SD) indices for 
      detecting the autonomic cardiac changes produced by endotoxemia in freely-moving 
      rats. In this context, we analyzed ECG-derived R-R time series in freely moving Dark 
      Agouti rats, which received lipopolysaccharide (LPS, n = 9), or vehicle (V, n = 7). 
      Five minutes R-R time series were assessed every hour up to +12 h and + 24 h 
      post-LPS injection. We found that SD indices showed significant differences at +7 h 
      between V vs. LPS groups and at +9 h between basal levels of LPS (-3 h) and post-LPS 
      injection (pre-LPS vs. post-LPS). In general, SD seems more appropriate than linear 
      indices to evaluate the autonomic changes of endotoxemic rats. Overall, the symbolic 
      parameters detected decreased R-R variability and complexity, which indicate a 
      modification of the autonomic regulation during LPS-induced endotoxemia. This 
      modification is probably related to a reduced activity of the cholinergic 
      anti-inflammatory pathway at the long term.

AB  - Problems in measuring the QT-dispersion are associated mostly with the inaccurate 
      location of the T-wave end. The complications are: (i) In methodology due to various 
      definition for Tend, (ii) In automatic measurements, due to low amplitude of T-wave, 
      presence of U-wave and noise, and (iii) In manual measurements, due to lack of 
      repeatability in the results, and involuntary subjectivism, when the QT-dispersion 
      is measured by a person familiar with the ultimate goal of the study. New ECG 
      repolarization parameter, 'T-Wave Area Dispersion' (TWAD), has been defined by 
      Kenttä et al. 2018. Clustering ability of TWAD for prediction of risk for Sudden 
      Cardiac Death (SCD) has been proven by the authors, working with a large database. 
      We have measured TWAD in peri-, and postoperative ECG recordings of patients, 
      undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting. Analysis of perioperative TWAD has shown 
      an increased risk of adverse events in diabetics. Postoperative TWAD parameters have 
      deteriorated proportionally in both diabetics/ non-diabetics groups indicating 
      increased cardiac risk within the first ten postoperative days. The ability for 
      diabetics/non-diabetics clustering of TWAD has been proven even in case of 
      inaccurate location of the Tend. So far this is a reasonable advantage of TWAD vs. 
      QT-dispersion in the study of ECG repolarization.

AB  - AIM: To develop a statistical index based on the phase space reconstruction (PSR) of 
      the electrocardiogram (ECG) for the accurate and timely diagnosis of ventricular 
      tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation (VF). METHODS: Thirty-two ECGs with 
      sinus rhythm (SR) and 32 ECGs with VT/VF were analyzed using the PSR technique. 
      Firstly, the method of time delay embedding were employed with the insertion of 
      delay "τ" in the original time-series X(t), which produces the Y(t)=X(t-τ). 
      Afterwards, a PSR diagram was reconstructed by plotting Y(t) against X(t). The 
      method of box counting was applied to analyze the behavior of the PSR trajectories. 
      Measures as mean (μ), standard deviation (σ) and coefficient of variation (CV=σ/μ), 
      kurtosis (β) for the box counting of PSR diagrams were reported. RESULTS: During SR, 
      CV was always <0.05, while with the onset of arrhythmia CV increased >0.05. A 
      similar pattern was observed with β, where <6 was considered as the cut-off point 
      between SR and VT/VF. Therefore, the upper threshold for SR was considered CVth=0.05 
      and βth<6. For optimisation of the accuracy, a new index (J) was proposed: 
      J=wCVCVth+1-wββth. During SR the upper limit of J was the value of 1. Furthermore 
      CV, β and J crossed the cut-off point timely before the onset of arrhythmia (average 
      time: 4min 31s; SD: 2min 30s); allowing sufficient time for preventive therapy. 
      CONCLUSION: The J index improved ECG utility for arrhythmia monitoring and detection 
      utility, allowing the prompt and accurate diagnosis of ventricular arrhythmias.

TI  - Improvement of in-hospital telemetry monitoring in coronary care units: an 
      intervention study for achieving optimal electrode placement and attachment, hygiene 
      and delivery of critical information to patients.
PG  - 515-23
LID - 10.1177/1474515113515585 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In-hospital telemetry monitoring is important for diagnosis and 
      treatment of patients at risk of developing life-threatening arrhythmias. It is 
      widely used in critical and non-critical care wards. Nurses are responsible for 
      correct electrode placement, thus ensuring optimal quality of the monitoring. The 
      aims of this study were to determine whether a complex educational intervention 
      improves (a) optimal electrode placement, (b) hygiene, and (c) delivery of critical 
      information to patients (reason for monitoring, limitations in cellular phone use, 
      and not to leave the ward without informing a member of staff). METHODS: A 
      prospective interventional study design was used, with data collection occurring 
      over two six-week periods: before implementation of the intervention (n=201) and 
      after the intervention (n=165). Standard abstraction forms were used to obtain data 
      on patients' clinical characteristics, and 10 variables related to electrode 
      placement and attachment, hygiene and delivery of critical information. RESULTS: At 
      pre-intervention registration, 26% of the electrodes were misplaced. Twelve per cent 
      of the patients received information about limiting their cellular phone use while 
      monitored, 70% were informed of the purpose of monitoring, and 71% used a protective 
      cover for their unit. Post-intervention, outcome measures for the three variables 
      improved significantly: use of protective cover (p<0.001), information about the 
      purpose of monitoring (p=0.005) and information about limitations in cellular phone 
      use (p=0.003). Nonetheless, 23% of the electrodes were still misplaced. CONCLUSION: 
      The study highlights the need for better, continued education for in-hospital 
      telemetry monitoring in coronary care units, and other units that monitor patients 
      with telemetry.

TI  - Reconstructions with identical filling (RIF) of the heart: a physiological approach 
      to image reconstruction in coronary CT angiography.
PG  - 2670-8
LID - 10.1007/s00330-012-2539-6 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To compare image quality in coronary artery computed tomography 
      angiography (cCTA) using reconstructions with automated phase detection and 
      Reconstructions computed with Identical Filling of the heart (RIF). METHODS: 
      Seventy-four patients underwent ECG-gated dual source CT (DSCT) between November 
      2009 and July 2010 for suspected coronary heart disease (n = 35), planning of 
      transcatheter aortic valve replacement (n = 34) or evaluation of ventricular 
      function (n = 5). Image data sets by the RIF formula and automated phase detection 
      were computed and evaluated with the AHA 15-segment model and a 5-grade Likert scale 
      (1: poor, 5: excellent quality). Subgroups regarding rhythm (sinus rhythm = SR; 
      arrhythmia = ARR) and potential premedication were evaluated by a per-segment, 
      per-vessel and per-patient analysis. RESULTS: RIF significantly improved image 
      quality in 10 of 15 coronary segments (P < 0.05). More diagnostic segments were 
      provided by RIF regarding the entire cohort (n = 693 vs. 590, P < 0.001) and all of 
      the subgroups (e.g. ARR: n = 143 vs. 72, P < 0.001). In arrhythmic patients (n = 
      19), more diagnostic vessels (e.g. LAD: n = 10 vs. 3; P < 0.014) and complete data 
      sets (n = 7 vs. 1; P < 0.001) were produced. CONCLUSIONS: RIF reconstruction is 
      superior to automatic diastolic non-edited reconstructions, especially in arrhythmic 
      patients. RIF theory provides a physiological approach for determining the optimal 
      image reconstruction point in ECG-gated CT angiography. KEY POINTS: Conventional CT 
      coronary angiography suffers from numerous artefacts in patients with irregular 
      rhythms. Coronary computed tomography angiograms (cCTA) were reconstructed with 
      identical cardiac filling (RIF). RIF reconstructions provide improved image quality 
      compared to non-edited standard reconstructions. RIF theory links physiology with 
      cardiac CT.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: T wave alternans (TWA) is a promising non-invasive risk stratification 
      tool for sudden cardiac death which can be detected from surface ECG. This paper 
      proposes a novel method to automatically detect TWA based on tensor decomposition 
      methods. APPROACH: Two different tensor decomposition approaches are examined and 
      compared, namely canonical polyadic decomposition and the more generalized variation 
      PARAFAC2 which allows the T waves to shift in time. RESULTS AND SIGNIFICANCE: 
      Results on different artificial and clinical signals show that the presented methods 
      are a robust and reliable way for TWA detection, and show the potential benefit of 
      tensors in ECG signal processing.

TI  - A novel adhesive biosensor system for detecting respiration, cardiac, and limb 
      movement signals during sleep: validation with polysomnography.
PG  - 397-408
LID - 10.2147/NSS.S179588 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although in-lab polysomnography (PSG) remains the gold standard for 
      objective sleep monitoring, the use of at-home sensor systems has gained popularity 
      in recent years. Two categories of monitoring, autonomic and limb movement 
      physiology, are increasingly recognized as critical for sleep disorder phenotyping, 
      yet at-home options remain limited outside of research protocols. The purpose of 
      this study was to validate the BiostampRC(®) sensor system for respiration, 
      electrocardiography (ECG), and leg electromyography (EMG) against gold standard PSG 
      recordings. METHODS: We report analysis of cardiac and respiratory data from 15 
      patients and anterior tibialis (AT) data from 19 patients undergoing clinical PSG 
      for any indication who simultaneously wore BiostampRC(®) sensors on the chest and 
      the bilateral AT muscles. BiostampRC(®) is a flexible, adhesive, wireless sensor 
      capable of capturing accelerometry, ECG, and EMG. We compared BiostampRC(®) data and 
      feature extractions with those obtained from PSG. RESULTS: The heart rate extracted 
      from BiostampRC(®) ECG showed strong agreement with the PSG (cohort root mean square 
      error of 5 beats per minute). We found the thoracic BiostampRC(®) respiratory 
      waveform, derived from its accelerometer, accurately calculated the respiratory rate 
      (mean average error of 0.26 and root mean square error of 1.84 breaths per minute). 
      The AT EMG signal supported periodic limb movement detection, with area under the 
      curve of the receiver operating characteristic curve equaling 0.88. Upon completion, 
      88% of subjects indicated willingness to wear BiostampRC(®) at home on an exit 
      survey. CONCLUSION: The results demonstrate that BiostampRC(®) is a tolerable and 
      accurate method for capturing respiration, ECG, and AT EMG time series signals 
      during overnight sleep when compared with simultaneous PSG recordings. The signal 
      quality sufficiently supports analytics of clinical relevance. Larger longitudinal 
      in-home studies are required to support the role of BiostampRC(®) in clinical 
      management of sleep disorders involving the autonomic nervous system and limb 
      movements.

TI  - Basic cardiovascular variability signals: mutual directed interactions explored in 
      the information domain.
PG  - 877-894
LID - 10.1088/1361-6579/aa5b77 [doi]
AB  - The study of short-term cardiovascular interactions is classically performed through 
      the bivariate analysis of the interactions between the beat-to-beat variability of 
      heart period (RR interval from the ECG) and systolic blood pressure (SBP). Recent 
      progress in the development of multivariate time series analysis methods is making 
      it possible to explore how directed interactions between two signals change in the 
      context of networks including other coupled signals. Exploiting these advances, the 
      present study aims at assessing directional cardiovascular interactions among the 
      basic variability signals of RR, SBP and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), using an 
      approach which allows direct comparison between bivariate and multivariate coupling 
      measures. To this end, we compute information-theoretic measures of the strength and 
      delay of causal interactions between RR, SBP and DBP using both bivariate and 
      trivariate (conditioned) formulations in a group of healthy subjects in a resting 
      state and during stress conditions induced by head-up tilt (HUT) and mental 
      arithmetics (MA). We find that bivariate measures better quantify the overall 
      (direct  +  indirect) information transferred between variables, while trivariate 
      measures better reflect the existence and delay of directed interactions. The main 
      physiological results are: (i) the detection during supine rest of strong 
      interactions along the pathway RR  →  DBP  →  SBP, reflecting marked Windkessel 
      and/or Frank-Starling effects; (ii) the finding of relatively weak baroreflex 
      effects SBP  →  RR at rest; (iii) the invariance of cardiovascular interactions 
      during MA, and the emergence of stronger and faster SBP  →  RR interactions, as well 
      as of weaker RR  →  DBP interactions, during HUT. These findings support the 
      importance of investigating cardiovascular interactions from a network perspective, 
      and suggest the usefulness of directed information measures to assess physiological 
      mechanisms and track their changes across different physiological states.

AB  - This study aims to analyze the autonomic nervous system response during head-up tilt 
      test (HUTT), by exploring the changes in dynamic properties of heart rate 
      variability in subjects with and without syncopes, to predict the outcome of HUTT. 
      Baroreflex response, as well as linear and non-linear parameters of RR-interval time 
      series, have been extracted from the ECG of 66 subjects: 35 with and 31 without 
      syncope during HUTT. The results show that, when considering the first 15 min of 
      tilting position, the total power spectrum, the standard deviation, the long-term 
      fractal scale of RR-interval and ΔRR-interval of time series increase, while the 
      sample entropy decreases in the positive group compared to the negative one. These 
      indices may be good predictors of positive response in patients with reflex syncope. 
      Additionally, an analysis of the first 15 min of tilting position using kernel 
      support vector machines leads to a correct classification of 85% of patients, within 
      negative and positive response groups (specificity = 80.6% and sensitivity = 88.5%). 
      In medical applications, it is important to avoid false negative diagnosis of 
      syncopes during HUTT. Taking this into account, an overall accuracy of 72.1% can be 
      obtained in the same window allowing the reduction of the examination time in the 
      clinical domain.

AB  - The major aim of this study is to describe a unified procedure for detecting noisy 
      segments and spikes in transduced signals with a cyclic but non-stationary periodic 
      nature. According to this procedure, the cycles of the signal (onset and offset 
      locations) are detected. Then, the cycles are clustered into a finite number of 
      groups based on appropriate geometrical- and frequency-based time series. Next, the 
      median template of each time series of each cluster is calculated. Afterwards, a 
      correlation-based technique is devised for making a comparison between a test cycle 
      feature and the associated time series of each cluster. Finally, by applying a 
      suitably chosen threshold for the calculated correlation values, a segment is 
      prescribed to be either clean or noisy. As a key merit of this research, the 
      procedure can introduce a decision support for choosing accurately 
      orthogonal-expansion-based filtering or to remove noisy segments. In this paper, the 
      application procedure of the proposed method is comprehensively described by 
      applying it to phonocardiogram (PCG) signals for finding noisy cycles. The database 
      consists of 126 records from several patients of a domestic research station 
      acquired by a 3M Littmann(®) 3200, 4KHz sampling frequency electronic stethoscope. 
      By implementing the noisy segments detection algorithm with this database, a 
      sensitivity of Se=91.41% and a positive predictive value, PPV=92.86% were obtained 
      based on physicians assessments.

TI  - Geometry of the Poincaré plot of RR intervals and its asymmetry in healthy adults.
PG  - 287-300
AB  - The geometry of the Poincaré plot of RR intervals is considered and its basic 
      descriptors are defined in terms of the second moment of a distribution of points in 
      a plane. One of the standard descriptors, SD1, is redefined and used to define two 
      new descriptors, SD1(UP) and SD1(DOWN), whose squares partition SD1(2) (the variance 
      corresponding to short-term heart rate variability) into contributions from 
      decelerations and accelerations of heart rate. It is shown that there is a visible 
      and statistically highly significant asymmetry in the Poincaré plot, with the upper 
      part, corresponding to decelerations of heart rate, larger than the lower part, 
      which corresponds to accelerations. The effect is shown in one hundred 30 min long 
      time series of RR intervals derived from the ECG recordings of 100 young (19-32 
      years old) and healthy adults. After shuffling the data to random order the 
      asymmetry disappears, which shows that this is a genuine physiological phenomenon 
      rather than an artefact of the method.

AB  - The increase in mortality associated with arrhythmia is an inevitable problem of 
      modern society such as westernized eating habits and an increase in stress due to 
      industrialization, and the related social costs are increasing. In this regard, the 
      supply of automatic external defibrillator (AED) used outside hospitals is 
      increasing mainly in public institutions, and AED is a medical practice performed by 
      non-medical personnel. Therefore, studies on arrhythmia detection algorithm to make 
      accurate clinical judgment for proper use are increasing. In this paper, we propose 
      a time domain analysis method to detect arrhythmia in real time and implement AED by 
      porting it to programmable gate array and digital signal processor. The analysis of 
      the phase domain improves the detection rate of R-peak using the differentiated 
      electrocardiogram (ECG) waveform rather than the existing ECG waveform and makes it 
      easy to distinguish the normal ECG from the arrhythmia signal in the phase domain. 
      The proposed algorithm was verified by simulation using Labview and ModelSim, and it 
      was verified that the proposed algorithm works effectively by performing animal 
      experiments using the implemented AED.

AB  - In an 86-year-old woman who had been treated for sick sinus syndrome, the small 
      high-frequency current delivered by pacemaker in order to measure the minutes 
      ventilation for utilizing the rate-response mode was transiently over-sensed on the 
      Holter electrocardiogram. Although her pacing system was working appropriately, the 
      numbers of the paced beats on the automatic Holter analysis were undercounted (from 
      >60% to <5%) during the over-sensing periods because these currents were recognized 
      as multiple pacing spikes. Physicians need to pay attention to such multiple pacing 
      spike markers, because these can be a cause of unreliable results of the Holter 
      analysis. <Learning objective: Paying attention to multiple pacing spike markers on 
      Holter electrocardiogram is clinically important in patients treated by a 
      rate-response pacemaker. This is because (1) this does not imply the malfunction of 
      the pacemaker system, and (2) results from automatic Holter analysis would not be 
      reliable during the period when these multiple pacing markers were recorded.>.

AB  - Having in mind the availability of electronic stethoscopes, phonocardiograms (PCGs) 
      have become popular for cardiovascular functionality monitoring and signal 
      processing applications. Detection of fundamental heart sounds (HSs), S1s and S2s, 
      is considered to be a crucial step in PCG analysis. Electrocardiogram (ECG), noted 
      as a reference signal, is often synchronously recorded in order to simplify the 
      S1/S2 detection process. Nevertheless, electronic stethoscopes are frequently used 
      without additional ECG equipment. We propose a new algorithm for automatic 
      fundamental HSs detection via: joint time-frequency representation based on pseudo 
      affine Wigner-Ville distribution (PAWVD), Haar wavelet lifting scheme (Haar-LS), 
      normalized average Shannon energy (NASE) and autocorrelation. The performance of the 
      proposed algorithm was calculated on both normal (50) and pathological (75) PCG 
      recordings, eight seconds long each, contributed by 125 different pediatric 
      patients. The algorithm showed relatively high recall (90.41%) and precision 
      (96.39%) rates of S1/S2 detection procedure in a variety of PCG signals, without ECG 
      as a reference. Furthermore, it indicated the ability to overcome splitting within 
      the S1/S2 heart sounds.

AB  - Electrocardiography (ECG) is a key non-invasive diagnostic tool for cardiovascular 
      diseases which is increasingly supported by algorithms based on machine learning. 
      Major obstacles for the development of automatic ECG interpretation algorithms are 
      both the lack of public datasets and well-defined benchmarking procedures to allow 
      comparison s of different algorithms. To address these issues, we put forward 
      PTB-XL, the to-date largest freely accessible clinical 12-lead ECG-waveform dataset 
      comprising 21837 records from 18885 patients of 10 seconds length. The ECG-waveform 
      data was annotated by up to two cardiologists as a multi-label dataset, where 
      diagnostic labels were further aggregated into super and subclasses. The dataset 
      covers a broad range of diagnostic classes including, in particular, a large 
      fraction of healthy records. The combination with additional metadata on 
      demographics, additional diagnostic statements, diagnosis likelihoods, manually 
      annotated signal properties as well as suggested folds for splitting training and 
      test sets turns the dataset into a rich resource for the development and the 
      evaluation of automatic ECG interpretation algorithms.

TI  - The perioperative effect of magnesium sulfate in patients with concentric left 
      ventricular hypertrophy undergoing cardiac surgery: A double-blinded randomized 
      study.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess the cardioprotective effect of 
      magnesium sulfate in patients with left ventricular concentric hypertrophy 
      undergoing cardiac surgery. DESIGN: The study was a double-blinded randomized study. 
      SETTING: This study was conducted at a cardiac center. PATIENTS: The study included 
      250 patients. INTERVENTION: The study included two groups (each = 125): Group M - 
      the patients who received magnesium sulfate infusion (15 mg/kg/h). The infusion was 
      started 20 min before induction, during surgery, and the first postoperative 24 h. 
      Group C - the patients who received an equal amount of normal saline. MEASUREMENTS: 
      The variables included troponin I level, creatinine kinase-MB (CK-MB) level, 
      electrocardiograph (ECG) with automatic ST-segment analysis (leads II and V), E/A 
      peak ratio, end-diastolic volume, cardiac index (CI), heart rate, mean arterial 
      blood pressure (MAP), mean arterial pulmonary pressure (mPAP), pulmonary and 
      systemic vascular resistances, and pharmacological and mechanical support. MAIN 
      RESULTS: The troponin I level, CK-MB, and ECG changes were lower in Group M than 
      Group C (P < 0.05). The E/A peak ratio and end-diastolic volume increased in Group M 
      than Group C (P < 0.05). There was a significant increase in the CI and a decrease 
      in the heart rate, mPAP, pulmonary vascular resistances, and pharmacological and 
      mechanical support in Group M compared to Group C (P < 0.05). There were minimal 
      changes in the MAP and systemic vascular resistance in Group M compared to Group C 
      (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The magnesium sulfate provides a cardioprotective effect in 
      patients with concentric ventricular hypertrophy undergoing cardiac surgery. It 
      decreases the incidence of perioperative myocardial infarction and arrhythmia. 
      Furthermore, it decreases the requirement of pharmacological and mechanical support.

AB  - Continuous and non-invasive monitoring of hemodynamic parameters through unobtrusive 
      wearable sensors can potentially aid in early detection of cardiac abnormalities, 
      and provides a viable solution for long-term follow-up of patients with chronic 
      cardiovascular diseases without disrupting the daily life activities. 
      Electrocardiogram (ECG) and siesmocardiogram (SCG) signals can be readily acquired 
      from light-weight electrodes and accelerometers respectively, which can be employed 
      to derive systolic time intervals (STI). For this purpose, automated and accurate 
      annotation of the relevant peaks in these signals is required, which is challenging 
      due to the inter-subject morphological variability and noise prone nature of SCG 
      signal. In this paper, an approach is proposed to automatically annotate the desired 
      peaks in SCG signal that are related to STI by utilizing the information of peak 
      detected in the sliding template to narrow-down the search for the desired peak in 
      actual SCG signal. Experimental validation of this approach performed in 
      conventional/controlled supine and realistic/challenging seated conditions, 
      containing over 5600 heart beat cycles shows good performance and robustness of the 
      proposed approach in noisy conditions. Automated measurement of STI in wearable 
      configuration can provide a quantified cardiac health index for long-term monitoring 
      of patients, elderly people at risk and health-enthusiasts.

PG  - 5319-22
LID - 10.1109/EMBC.2013.6610750 [doi]
AB  - This research proposes an augmented magnetic navigation system for Transcatheter 
      Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI) employing a magnetic tracking system (MTS) combined 
      with a dynamic aortic model and intra-operative ultrasound (US) images. The dynamic 
      3D aortic model is constructed based on the preoperative 4D computed tomography 
      (CT), which is animated according to the real time electrocardiograph (ECG) input of 
      patient. And a preoperative planning is performed to determine the target position 
      of the aortic valve prosthesis. The temporal alignment is performed to synchronize 
      the ECG signals, intra-operative US image and tracking information. Afterwards, with 
      the assistance of synchronized ECG signals, the contour of aortic root automatic 
      extracted from short axis US image is registered to the dynamic aortic model by a 
      feature based registration intra-operatively. Then the augmented MTS guides the 
      interventionist to confidently position and deploy the aortic valve prosthesis to 
      target. The system was validated by animal studies on three porcine subjects, the 
      deployment and tilting errors of which are 3.17 ± 0.91 mm and 7.40 ± 2.89° 
      respectively.

TI  - Early respiratory dysfunction as a biomarker for epileptic encephalopathy.
PG  - 381-5
LID - 10.1111/ane.12133 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: West syndrome is an epileptic encephalopathy starting in infancy with 
      almost continuous interictal epileptic activity, so-called hypsarrhythmia pattern, 
      and therefore is an interesting model for investigating the effect of interictal 
      epileptic activity on autonomic function. It is known that autonomic dysfunction 
      contributes to morbidity and mortality in epilepsy. Our aim is to investigate the 
      effect of interictal epileptic activity in West syndrome on respiratory control. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Interictal single-lead ECG signals were extracted from 24-h 
      video-EEG recordings in 10 children suffering from West syndrome and 14 control 
      subjects. RR interval time series were calculated, and respiration was derived from 
      the ECG signal. ECG-derived respiration (EDR) signals were computed and time and 
      frequency domain parameters were extracted to characterize the respiration pattern. 
      RESULTS: In time domain, the standard deviation of the EDR signal is significantly 
      lower in patients with West syndrome compared to control subjects. This finding is 
      an indication of a less variable respiratory rate. In frequency domain, we analyzed 
      the mean power spectrum for the EDR. In patients with West syndrome, there is more 
      activity at the lower frequencies considered to be a risk factor for apneas. Second, 
      there is an attenuated peak at the higher frequency band where normal respiratory 
      rate is to be found, indicating an abnormal breathing pattern. CONCLUSIONS: Our 
      results show that there is a clear dysfunction in autonomic respiratory control in 
      patients with West syndrome, in between the typical ictal epileptic spasms, compared 
      to control subjects. Respiration is more fixed and contains a higher risk of apneas.

AB  - Background Prolongation of the QTc interval may lead to life threatening 
      arrhythmias. QTc prolongation is common in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. The 
      objectives of this study were to identify the role of drug-drug interactions (DDIs) 
      and other predictors (age, sex, cardiovascular diseases, and electrolyte 
      abnormalities) in life threatening QTc prolongation in patients admitted to medical 
      (M), surgical (S) and emergency (E) ICUs. Methods This prospective, observational 
      study included patients above the age of 18 years who were admitted to SICU, EICU, 
      and MICU at a tertiary respiratory referral center. Electrocardiogram (ECG) 
      monitoring was performed during the first 5 days of ICU admission. Risk factors and 
      DDIs which were anticipated to be associated with the prolongation of the QTc 
      interval were assessed for all patients. Results Two hundred patients were included 
      in the study. QTc prolongation occurred in 10.7% of patients and the majority of 
      patients presenting with QTc prolongation had creatinine levels above 1.3 mg/dL 
      during their 5 days of ICU admission. Incidence of pharmacodynamic (PD) DDIs was 
      significantly higher in patients with QTc prolongation vs. other patients. 
      Creatinine levels above 1.3 mg/dL and PD DDIs were associated with QTc prolongation 
      during 5 days of ICU admission. Conclusions High serum creatinine and PD DDIs can 
      increase the risk of QTc prolongation in patients admitted to the ICU. QTc interval 
      measurements should be performed prior to initiation or after starting any drug that 
      is associated with QT prolongation, specifically in patients with the known risk 
      factors.

TI  - Automatic and Robust Delineation of the Fiducial Points of the Seismocardiogram 
      Signal for Non-invasive Estimation of Cardiac Time Intervals.
PG  - 1701-1710
LID - 10.1109/TBME.2016.2616382 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this research was to design a delineation algorithm that 
      could detect specific fiducial points of the seismocardiogram (SCG) signal with or 
      without using the electrocardiogram (ECG) R-wave as the reference point. The 
      detected fiducial points were used to estimate cardiac time intervals. Due to 
      complexity and sensitivity of the SCG signal, the algorithm was designed to robustly 
      discard the low-quality cardiac cycles, which are the ones that contain 
      unrecognizable fiducial points. METHOD: The algorithm was trained on a dataset 
      containing 48,318 manually annotated cardiac cycles. It was then applied to three 
      test datasets: 65 young healthy individuals (dataset 1), 15 individuals above 44 
      years old (dataset 2), and 25 patients with previous heart conditions (dataset 3). 
      RESULTS: The algorithm accomplished high prediction accuracy with the rootmean- 
      square-error of less than 5 ms for all the test datasets. The algorithm overall mean 
      detection rate per individual recordings (DRI) were 74, 68, and 42 percent for the 
      three test datasets when concurrent ECG and SCG were used. For the standalone SCG 
      case, the mean DRI was 32, 14 and 21 percent. CONCLUSION: When the proposed 
      algorithm applied to concurrent ECG and SCG signals, the desired fiducial points of 
      the SCG signal were successfully estimated with a high detection rate. For the 
      standalone case, however, the algorithm achieved high prediction accuracy and 
      detection rate for only the young individual dataset. SIGNIFICANCE: The presented 
      algorithm could be used for accurate and non-invasive estimation of cardiac time 
      intervals.

AB  - Electrocardiogram (ECG) signal processing and analysis provide crucial information 
      about functional status of the heart. The QRS complex represents the most important 
      component within the ECG signal. Its detection is the first step of all kinds of 
      automatic feature extraction. QRS detector must be able to detect a large number of 
      different QRS morphologies. This paper examines the use of wavelet detail 
      coefficients for the accurate detection of different QRS morphologies in ECG. Our 
      method is based on the power spectrum of QRS complexes in different energy levels 
      since it differs from normal beats to abnormal ones. This property is used to 
      discriminate between true beats (normal and abnormal) and false beats. Significant 
      performance enhancement is observed when the proposed approach is tested with the 
      MIT-BIH arrhythmia database (MITDB). The obtained results show a sensitivity of 
      99.64% and a positive predictivity of 99.82%.

TI  - Feasibility of home-based cardiac telerehabilitation: Results of TeleInterMed study.
PG  - 539-46
LID - 10.5603/CJ.a2014.0005 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is recommended as an important component of 
      a comprehensive approach to cardiovascular disease (CVD) patients. Data have shown 
      that a small percentage of eligible patients participate in CR despite their well 
      established benefits. Applying telerehabilitation provides an opportunity to improve 
      the implementation of and adherence to CR. The purpose of the study was to evaluate 
      a wide implementation and feasibility of home-based cardiac telerehabilitation 
      (HTCR) in patients suffering from CVD and to assessits safety, patients' acceptance 
      of and adherence to HTCR. METHODS: The study included 365 patients (left ventricular 
      ejection fraction 56 ± 8%; aged 58 ± 10 years). They participated in 4-week HTCR 
      based on walking, nordic walking or cycloergometer training. HTCR was telemonitored 
      with a device adjusted to register electrocardiogram (ECG) recording and to transmit 
      data via mobile phone to the monitoring center. The moments of automatic ECG 
      registration were pre-set and coordinated with CR. The influence on physical 
      capacity was assessed by comparing changes - in time of exercise test, functional 
      capacity, 6-min walking test distance from the beginning and the end of HTCR. At the 
      end of the study, patients filled in a questionnaire in order to assess their 
      acceptance of HTCR. RESULTS: HTCR resulted in a significant improvement in all 
      parameters. There were neither deaths nor adverse events during HTCR. Patients 
      accepted HTCR, including the need for interactive everyday collaboration with the 
      monitoring center. There were only 0.8% non-adherent patients. CONCLUSIONS: HTCR is 
      a feasible, safe form of rehabilitation, well accepted by patients. The adherence to 
      HTCR was high and promising.

LID - 10.1088/0967-3334/31/9/009 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the minimal sampling rate (SR) required for 
      blood pressure (BP) waveform recordings to accurately determine BP and heart rate 
      (HR) variability indices and baroreceptor reflex sensitivity in rats and mice. We 
      also determined if an 8-bit (versus 12-bit) analog-to-digital converter (ADC) 
      resolution is sufficient to accurately determine these hemodynamic parameters and if 
      spline interpolation to 1000 Hz of BP waveforms sampled at lower SRs can improve 
      accuracy. BP and ECG recordings (1000 Hz SR, 12-bit ADC resolution) from two strains 
      of rats and BP recordings (1000 Hz SR, 12-bit ADC resolution) from two strains of 
      mice were mathematically converted to lower SRs and/or 8-bit ADC resolution. 
      Time-domain HR variability and frequency-domain HR and BP variability indices and 
      baroreflex sensitivity (using the sequence technique) were determined and the 
      results obtained from the original files were compared to the results obtained from 
      the mathematically altered files. Our results demonstrate that an ADC resolution of 
      8 bit is not sufficient to determine HR and BP variability in rats and mice and 
      baroreceptor reflex sensitivity in mice. Average values for systolic, mean and 
      diastolic BP and HR can be accurately derived from BP waveforms recorded at a 
      minimal SR of 200 Hz in rats and mice. Spline interpolation of BP waveforms to 1000 
      Hz prior to extracting derived parameters reduces this minimal SR to 50 Hz in rats 
      but still requires 200 Hz in mice. Frequency-domain BP variability (very low and low 
      frequency spectral powers) can be estimated accurately at a minimum SR of 100 Hz in 
      rats and mice and spline interpolation of BP waveforms to 1000 Hz reduces this 
      minimal SR to 50 Hz in rats but does not reduce the minimal SR in mice. Time- and 
      frequency-domain HR variability parameters require at least a SR of 1000 Hz in rats 
      and mice. Spline interpolation of BP waveforms to 1000 Hz reduces this minimal SR to 
      100 Hz in rats and to 200 Hz in mice. Estimation of baroreflex sensitivity using the 
      sequence technique requires a SR of at least 1000 Hz in rats and mice. Spline 
      interpolation of BP waveforms to 1000 Hz reduces this minimal SR to 100 Hz in rats 
      but does not reduce the minimum SR in mice. Finally, our results indicate that HR 
      time series derived from BP waveforms are not totally consistent with HR time series 
      derived from the ECG in rats. In conclusion, accurate assessment of HR variability 
      and baroreflex sensitivity from BP waveform recordings requires a SR of at least 
      1000 Hz in rats and mice. If lower SRs are used for BP waveform recordings, a cubic 
      spline interpolation to 1000 Hz (or an even higher SR) prior to extracting derived 
      parameters significantly improves accuracy.

TI  - A Novel Time-Varying Spectral Filtering Algorithm for Reconstruction of Motion 
      Artifact Corrupted Heart Rate Signals During Intense Physical Activities Using a 
      Wearable Photoplethysmogram Sensor.
LID - 10.3390/s16010010 [doi]
LID - 10
AB  - Accurate estimation of heart rates from photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals during 
      intense physical activity is a very challenging problem. This is because strenuous 
      and high intensity exercise can result in severe motion artifacts in PPG signals, 
      making accurate heart rate (HR) estimation difficult. In this study we investigated 
      a novel technique to accurately reconstruct motion-corrupted PPG signals and HR 
      based on time-varying spectral analysis. The algorithm is called Spectral filter 
      algorithm for Motion Artifacts and heart rate reconstruction (SpaMA). The idea is to 
      calculate the power spectral density of both PPG and accelerometer signals for each 
      time shift of a windowed data segment. By comparing time-varying spectra of PPG and 
      accelerometer data, those frequency peaks resulting from motion artifacts can be 
      distinguished from the PPG spectrum. The SpaMA approach was applied to three 
      different datasets and four types of activities: (1) training datasets from the 2015 
      IEEE Signal Process. Cup Database recorded from 12 subjects while performing 
      treadmill exercise from 1 km/h to 15 km/h; (2) test datasets from the 2015 IEEE 
      Signal Process. Cup Database recorded from 11 subjects while performing forearm and 
      upper arm exercise. (3) Chon Lab dataset including 10 min recordings from 10 
      subjects during treadmill exercise. The ECG signals from all three datasets provided 
      the reference HRs which were used to determine the accuracy of our SpaMA algorithm. 
      The performance of the SpaMA approach was calculated by computing the mean absolute 
      error between the estimated HR from the PPG and the reference HR from the ECG. The 
      average estimation errors using our method on the first, second and third datasets 
      are 0.89, 1.93 and 1.38 beats/min respectively, while the overall error on all 33 
      subjects is 1.86 beats/min and the performance on only treadmill experiment datasets 
      (22 subjects) is 1.11 beats/min. Moreover, it was found that dynamics of heart rate 
      variability can be accurately captured using the algorithm where the mean Pearson's 
      correlation coefficient between the power spectral densities of the reference and 
      the reconstructed heart rate time series was found to be 0.98. These results show 
      that the SpaMA method has a potential for PPG-based HR monitoring in wearable 
      devices for fitness tracking and health monitoring during intense physical 
      activities.

TI  - Automatic calculation of myocardial external efficiency using a single (11)C-acetate 
      PET scan.
PG  - 1937-1944
LID - 10.1007/s12350-018-1338-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Myocardial external efficiency (MEE) is defined as the ratio of kinetic 
      energy associated with cardiac work [forward cardiac output (FCO)*mean systemic 
      pressure] and the chemical energy from oxygen consumed (MVO(2)) by the left 
      ventricular mass (LVM). We developed a fully automated method for estimating MEE 
      based on a single (11)C-acetate PET scan without ECG-gating. METHODS AND RESULTS: 
      Ten healthy controls, 34 patients with aortic valve stenosis (AVS), and 20 patients 
      with mitral valve regurgitation (MVR) were recruited in a dual-center study. MVO(2) 
      was calculated using washout of (11)C -acetate activity. FCO and LVM were calculated 
      automatically using dynamic PET and parametric image formation. FCO and LVM were 
      also obtained using cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) in all subjects. The 
      correlation between MEE(PET-CMR) and MEE(PET) was high (r = 0.85, P < 0.001) without 
      significant bias. MEE(PET) was 23.6 ± 4.2% for controls and was lowered in AVS 
      (17.2 ± 4.3%, P < 0.001) and in MVR (18.0 ± 5.2%, P = 0.004). MEE(PET) was strongly 
      associated with both NYHA class (P < 0.001) and the magnitude of valvular 
      dysfunction (mean aortic gradient: P < 0.001, regurgitant fraction: P = 0.009). 
      CONCLUSION: A single (11)C-acetate PET yields accurate and automated MEE results on 
      different scanners. MEE might provide an unbiased measurement of the phenotypic 
      response to valvular disease.

TI  - Amitraz poisoning: A case report of an unusual pesticide poisoning in Sri Lanka and 
      literature review.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Amitraz is a pesticide used worldwide on animals and in agriculture. It 
      contains triazapentadiene, which is a centrally acting alpha-2 adrenergic agonist. 
      Amitraz poisoning is fairly uncommon in humans and occurs via oral, dermal or 
      inhalational routes. Only a limited number of case reports of human intoxication 
      have been published and most of them are of accidental ingestion by children. CASE 
      PRESENTATION: A twenty-year-old Sri Lankan female presented following self-ingestion 
      of 20 ml of amitraz resulting in 37.8 mg/ kg of amitraz poisoning. She lost 
      consciousness after 20 min of ingestion, developed bradycardia and hypotension, 
      which needed intravenous fluid resuscitation and dobutamine. Gastric lavage was 
      performed. Her bradycardia persisted for 36 h and she was drowsy for 48 h. She did 
      not develop respiratory depression, convulsions or hypothermia and the urine output 
      was normal. Arterial blood gas revealed mild respiratory alkalosis. She recovered 
      fully within 48 h and was discharged on day 3. CONCLUSION: The clinical 
      manifestations of amitraz (impaired consciousness, drowsiness, vomiting, 
      disorientation, miosis, mydriasis, hypotension, bradycardia, respiratory depression, 
      hypothermia, generalized seizures, hyperglycemia and glycosuria) can be explained by 
      the agonist action of amitraz on α1 and α2 receptors. Management of amitraz 
      poisoning is still considered to be supportive and symptomatic with monitoring of 
      nervous system, cardiovascular and respiratory systems. Activated charcoal may still 
      be considered for treatment and the place for gastric lavage is controversial. 
      Atropine is effective for symptomatic bradycardia and inotropic support is needed 
      for hypotension that does not respond to fluid resuscitation. Diazepam or Lorazepam 
      is used for convulsions and some patients may require intubation and ICU care. 
      Several α2 adrenergic antagonists like yohimbine have been tried on animals, which 
      have successfully reversed the effects of amitraz. Since the majority of amitraz 
      poisoning cases are due to accidental ingestion, manufactures, regulatory 
      authorities and national poisons control centers have a significant role to play in 
      minimizing its occurrence.

TI  - Effect of anemia on the frontal QRS-T angle.
LID - 10.23736/S0026-4725.20.05105-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Anemia is a common health problem worldwide and is associated with a 
      poor prognosis for cardiovascular diseases. It can alter myocardial depolarization 
      and repolarization by affecting the generation and propagation of electrical 
      impulses. The frontal QRS-T angle is a novel marker of the absolute difference 
      between myocardial depolarization and repolarization. This study investigated the 
      effects of anemia on the frontal QRS-T angle. METHODS: The study included 66 anemic 
      subjects with no cardiac disorders, and 50 age- and gender-matched controls. 
      Twelve-lead electrocardiography (ECG) was obtained for all subjects, and the frontal 
      QRS-T angle was calculated based on the automatic report of the ECG machine. 
      RESULTS: Subjects with anemia had a significantly higher frontal QRS-T angle than 
      subjects without anemia (28.9 ± 14.1 vs. 22.5 ± 11.8, p = 0.011). In correlation 
      analysis, the frontal QRS-T angle was positively correlated with the body mass index 
      (BMI; r = 0.287, p = 0.002), left ventricular mass (LVM; r = 0.264, p = 0.004), and 
      heart rate (r = 0.275, p = 0.003) and negatively correlated with the hemoglobin 
      level (r = -0.349, p < 0.001). Multivariate regression analysis showed that the 
      hemoglobin level (β = -0.254, tβ = -2.805, p = 0.006), BMI (β=0.240, t=2.770, 
      p=0.007), and LVM (β=0.201, t=2.303, p=0.023) were independently associated with the 
      frontal QRS-T angle. CONCLUSIONS: The hemoglobin level was found to be an 
      independent predictor of the frontal QRS-T angle.

LID - 10.1136/bcr-2012-006620 [doi]
LID - bcr2012006620
AB  - A 44-year-old woman with a history of complicated type 2 diabetes mellitus presented 
      with a diagnosis of right-hemispheric ischaemic stroke. She developed acute 
      respiratory distress with radiological evidence of pulmonary oedema. The ECG showed 
      poorly significant ST-segment changes, with a minimal increase of cardiac 
      biomarkers. Echocardiography showed a severely depressed left ventricular function, 
      with also low values of cardiac output at invasive monitoring. The possibility of 
      neurogenic-stunned myocardium was discussed and a metabolic resuscitation with 
      high-dose insulin was proposed. An intravenous bolus of 80 units of insulin (0.72 
      IU/kg) was followed by a continuous infusion at the rate of 160 IU/h (1.45 IU/kg/h). 
      The treatment led to a rapid and sustained improvement of the haemodynamic condition 
      and was well tolerated. In comparison with dobutamine, insulin had significant 
      inotropic effects without tachycardia. The patient unfortunately died on day 35, 
      from respiratory complications after poor neurological recovery.

LID - 10.1016/j.ijcard.2016.12.128 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Guidelines recommend that implantable loop recorders (ILRs) are used in 
      the evaluation of people with recurrent unexplained syncope in the absence of 
      high-risk criteria, and in high-risk patients after a negative evaluation. The aim 
      of this systematic review was to analyze the diagnostic yield of ILRs in these 
      patients. METHODS: We performed a systematic search in order to retrieve studies 
      enrolling adults undergoing ILR implantation for undetermined syncope. The primary 
      outcome was the overall diagnostic yield, defined as the proportion of patients with 
      syncope recurrence and an available ILR recording or an automatic detection of a 
      significant arrhythmia. Secondary outcomes were the proportions of patients with the 
      specific etiologic diagnoses on the total of subjects and the proportion of an 
      analyzable ECG recording during symptoms. We used a random effects model for the 
      meta-analyses. RESULTS: Forty-nine studies, enrolling 4381 subjects, were included. 
      The overall diagnostic yield was 43.9% (95% CI=40.2%, 47.6%; I(2)=79.8%). The 
      proportions of subjects finally diagnosed with arrhythmic syncope, ventricular 
      arrhythmias, supraventricular arrhythmias and bradyarrhythmias were 26.5%, 2.7%, 
      4.9% and 18.2%, respectively. The proportion of an analyzable ECG recording during 
      symptoms was 89.5% (95% CI=86.1%, 92.1%; 1236 subjects; 36 studies; I(2)=44.9%). 
      Median time to diagnosis was 134days. Heterogeneity is an important limitation to be 
      acknowledged. CONCLUSIONS: About a half of unexplained syncope subjects implanted 
      with an ILR were diagnosed, and around 50% of them had an arrhythmia. 
      Life-threatening arrhythmias as well as ILR complications and death due to 
      arrhythmic events were very rare.

TI  - [Technologies for Complex Intelligent Clinical Data Analysis].
PG  - 160-71
AB  - The paper presents the system for intelligent analysis of clinical information. 
      Authors describe methods implemented in the system for clinical information 
      retrieval, intelligent diagnostics of chronic diseases, patient's features 
      importance and for detection of hidden dependencies between features. Results of the 
      experimental evaluation of these methods are also presented. BACKGROUND: Healthcare 
      facilities generate a large flow of both structured and unstructured data which 
      contain important information about patients. Test results are usually retained as 
      structured data but some data is retained in the form of natural language texts 
      (medical history, the results of physical examination, and the results of other 
      examinations, such as ultrasound, ECG or X-ray studies). Many tasks arising in 
      clinical practice can be automated applying methods for intelligent analysis of 
      accumulated structured array and unstructured data that leads to improvement of the 
      healthcare quality. AIMS: the creation of the complex system for intelligent data 
      analysis in the multi-disciplinary pediatric center. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Authors 
      propose methods for information extraction from clinical texts in Russian. The 
      methods are carried out on the basis of deep linguistic analysis. They retrieve 
      terms of diseases, symptoms, areas of the body and drugs. The methods can recognize 
      additional attributes such as "negation" (indicates that the disease is absent), "no 
      patient" (indicates that the disease refers to the patient's family member, but not 
      to the patient), "severity of illness", disease course", "body region to which the 
      disease refers". Authors use a set of hand-drawn templates and various techniques 
      based on machine learning to retrieve information using a medical thesaurus. The 
      extracted information is used to solve the problem of automatic diagnosis of chronic 
      diseases. A machine learning method for classification of patients with similar 
      nosology and the methodfor determining the most informative patients'features are 
      also proposed. RESULTS: Authors have processed anonymized health records from the 
      pediatric center to estimate the proposed methods. The results show the 
      applicability of the information extracted from the texts for solving practical 
      problems. The records ofpatients with allergic, glomerular and rheumatic diseases 
      were used for experimental assessment of the method of automatic diagnostic. Authors 
      have also determined the most appropriate machine learning methods for 
      classification of patients for each group of diseases, as well as the most 
      informative disease signs. It has been found that using additional information 
      extracted from clinical texts, together with structured data helps to improve the 
      quality of diagnosis of chronic diseases. Authors have also obtained pattern 
      combinations of signs of diseases. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed methods have been 
      implemented in the intelligent data processing system for a multidisciplinary 
      pediatric center. The experimental results show the availability of the system to 
      improve the quality of pediatric healthcare.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Repetitive interpolated ventricular bigeminy (RIVB) can introduce a 
      doubling of the ventricular rate. OBJECTIVE: To clarify the mechanism of RIVB, we 
      hypothesized that it was introduced by a strong modulation of the ventricular 
      automatic focus. METHODS: RIVB, defined as more than 7 bigeminy events, was detected 
      by instantaneous heart rate and bigeminy interval (BI) tachograms in 1450 successive 
      patients with frequent ventricular premature contractions (≥3000 per day). 
      Postextrasystolic interval bigeminy interval curves were plotted to determine the 
      degree of modulation. Mean sinus cycle length bigeminy interval curves were plotted 
      for selection. RIVB was simulated by using a computer-based parasystole model. 
      RESULTS: RIVB was observed in 7 patients (age 60 ± 16 years; 2 men and 5 women) with 
      a heart rate of 58.2 ± 6.5 beats/min during a rest period both during the day and at 
      night. The tachograms disclosed the onset of the RIVB with a doubled ventricular 
      rate to 112.3 ± 8.5 beats/min. On the postextrasystolic interval bigeminy interval 
      curves, compensatory bigeminy and interpolated bigeminy constituted overlapping 
      regression lines with slopes close to 1.00 and RIVB was located in the lower left 
      portion. RIVB lasting for up to 3 hours was quickly detected by mean sinus cycle 
      length bigeminy interval curve. The PQ interval immediately after RIVB was prolonged 
      in comparison with baseline (0.18 ± 0.02 to 0.21 ± 0.02 seconds; P < .001). The 
      simulation was able to reproduce RIVB faithfully at a slow heart rate. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Our findings support the hypothesis that RIVB was introduced by strongly modulated 
      ventricular pacemaker accelerated by an intervening normal QRS.

      multi-channel information fusion method.
PG  - 1298-312
LID - 10.1088/0967-3334/37/8/1298 [doi]
AB  - False alarm (FA) rates as high as 86% have been reported in intensive care unit 
      monitors. High FA rates decrease quality of care by slowing staff response times 
      while increasing patient burdens and stresses. In this study, we proposed a 
      rule-based and multi-channel information fusion method for accurately classifying 
      the true or false alarms for five life-threatening arrhythmias: asystole (ASY), 
      extreme bradycardia (EBR), extreme tachycardia (ETC), ventricular tachycardia (VTA) 
      and ventricular flutter/fibrillation (VFB). The proposed method consisted of five 
      steps: (1) signal pre-processing, (2) feature detection and validation, (3) 
      true/false alarm determination for each channel, (4) 'real-time' true/false alarm 
      determination and (5) 'retrospective' true/false alarm determination (if needed). Up 
      to four signal channels, that is, two electrocardiogram signals, one arterial blood 
      pressure and/or one photoplethysmogram signal were included in the analysis. Two 
      events were set for the method validation: event 1 for 'real-time' and event 2 for 
      'retrospective' alarm classification. The results showed that 100% true positive 
      ratio (i.e. sensitivity) on the training set were obtained for ASY, EBR, ETC and VFB 
      types, and 94% for VTA type, accompanied by the corresponding true negative ratio 
      (i.e. specificity) results of 93%, 81%, 78%, 85% and 50% respectively, resulting in 
      the score values of 96.50, 90.70, 88.89, 92.31 and 64.90, as well as with a final 
      score of 80.57 for event 1 and 79.12 for event 2. For the test set, the proposed 
      method obtained the score of 88.73 for ASY, 77.78 for EBR, 89.92 for ETC, 67.74 for 
      VFB and 61.04 for VTA types, with the final score of 71.68 for event 1 and 75.91 for 
      event 2.

TI  - Preclinical evidence of mitochondrial nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide as an 
      effective alarm parameter under hypoxia.
PG  - 17005
LID - 10.1117/1.JBO.19.1.017005 [doi]
AB  - Early detection of tissue hypoxia in the intensive care unit is essential for 
      effective treatment. Reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) has been 
      suggested to be the most sensitive indicator of tissue oxygenation at the 
      mitochondrial level. However, no experimental evidence comparing the kinetics of 
      changes in NADH and other physiological parameters has been provided. The aim of 
      this study is to obtain the missing data in a systematic and reliable manner. We 
      constructed four acute hypoxia models, including hypoxic hypoxia, hypemic hypoxia, 
      circulatory hypoxia, and histogenous hypoxia, and measured NADH fluorescence, tissue 
      reflectance, cerebral blood flow, respiration, and electrocardiography 
      simultaneously from the induction of hypoxia until death. We found that NADH was not 
      always the first onset parameter responding to hypoxia. The order of responses was 
      mainly affected by the cause of hypoxia. However, NADH reached its alarm level 
      earlier than the other monitored parameters, ranging from several seconds to 
      >10  min. As such, we suggest that the NADH can be used as a hypoxia indicator, 
      although the exact level that should be used must be further investigated. When the 
      NADH alarm is detected, the body still has a chance to recover if appropriate and 
      timely treatment is provided.

AB  - Automatic feature extraction and classification are two main tasks in abnormal ECG 
      beat recognition. Feature extraction is an important prerequisite prior to 
      classification since it provides the classifier with input features, and the 
      performance of classifier depends significantly on the quality of these features. 
      This study develops an effective method to extract low-dimensional ECG beat feature 
      vectors. It employs wavelet multi-resolution analysis to extract time-frequency 
      domain features and then applies principle component analysis to reduce the 
      dimension of the feature vector. In classification, 12-element feature vectors 
      characterizing six types of beats are used as inputs for one-versus-one support 
      vector machine, which is conducted in form of 10-fold cross validation with 
      beat-based and record-based training schemes. Tested upon a total of 107049 beats 
      from MIT-BIH arrhythmia database, our method has achieved average sensitivity, 
      specificity and accuracy of 99.09%, 99.82% and 99.70%, respectively, using the 
      beat-based training scheme, and 44.40%, 88.88% and 81.47%, respectively, using the 
      record-based training scheme.

TI  - Automatic analysis of pre-ejection period during sleep using impedance cardiogram.
PG  - e13355
LID - 10.1111/psyp.13355 [doi]
AB  - The pre-ejection period (PEP) is a valid index of myocardial contractility and 
      beta-adrenergic sympathetic control of the heart defined as the time between 
      electrical systole (ECG Q wave) to the initial opening of the aortic valve, 
      estimated as the B point on the impedance cardiogram (ICG). B-point detection 
      accuracy can be severely impacted if ICG cardiac cycles corrupted by motion 
      artifact, noise, or electrode displacement are included in the analyses. Here, we 
      developed new algorithms to detect and exclude corrupted ICG cycles by analyzing 
      their level of activity. PEP was then estimated and analyzed on ensemble-averaged 
      clean ICG cycles using an automatic algorithm previously developed by the authors 
      for the detection of B point in awake individuals. We investigated the algorithms' 
      performance relative to expert visual scoring on long-duration data collected from 
      20 participants during overnight recordings, where the quality of ICG could be 
      highly affected by movement artifacts and electrode displacements and the signal 
      could also vary according to sleep stage and time of night. The artifact rejection 
      algorithm achieved a high accuracy of 87% in detection of expert-identified 
      corrupted ICG cycles, including those with normal amplitude as well as out-of-range 
      values, and was robust to different types and levels of artifact. Intraclass 
      correlations for concurrent validity of the B-point detection algorithm in different 
      sleep stages and in-bed wakefulness exceeded 0.98, indicating excellent agreement 
      with the expert. The algorithms show promise toward sleep applications requiring 
      accurate and reliable automatic measurement of cardiac hemodynamic parameters.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Customizing monitor alarm settings to individual patients can reduce 
      alarm fatigue in intensive care units (ICUs), but has not been widely studied. 
      OBJECTIVES: To understand ICU nurses' approaches to customization of 
      electrocardiographic (ECG) monitor alarms. METHODS: A convergent mixed methods study 
      was conducted in 3 ICUs in 1 hospital. Data on the type and frequency of ECG alarm 
      customization were collected from patient monitors (n=298). Nurses' customization 
      clinical reasoning was explored through semi-structured interviews (n=27). RESULTS: 
      Of the 298 patients, 58.7% had ≥1 alarm(s) customized. Heart rate limits, irregular 
      heart rate, and atrial fibrillation were the most commonly customized alarms. 
      Interviews revealed that customization practices varied widely and were influenced 
      by factors including clinical expertise, lack of customization education, and 
      negative experiences. CONCLUSION: Alarm customization is nuanced and requires 
      adequate support to develop safe and effective practices. The challenges identified 
      can inform development of strategies to improve alarm customization.

PG  - 830-4
AB  - Electrical defibrillation is the most effective way to treat the ventricular 
      tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation (VF). An automatic external 
      defibrillator based on DSP is introduced in this paper. The whole design consists of 
      the signal collection module, the microprocessor controlingl module, the display 
      module, the defibrillation module and the automatic recognition algorithm for VF and 
      non VF, etc. This automatic external defibrillator has achieved goals such as ECG 
      signal real-time acquisition, ECG wave synchronous display, data delivering to U 
      disk and automatic defibrillate when shockable rhythm appears, etc.

      success through machine learning.

LID - 10.1186/1472-6947-12-116 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) is a common presenting dysrhythmia in the 
      setting of cardiac arrest whose main treatment is defibrillation through direct 
      current countershock to achieve return of spontaneous circulation. However, often 
      defibrillation is unsuccessful and may even lead to the transition of VF to more 
      nefarious rhythms such as asystole or pulseless electrical activity. Multiple 
      methods have been proposed for predicting defibrillation success based on 
      examination of the VF waveform. To date, however, no analytical technique has been 
      widely accepted. We developed a unique approach of computational VF waveform 
      analysis, with and without addition of the signal of end-tidal carbon dioxide 
      (PetCO2), using advanced machine learning algorithms. We compare these results with 
      those obtained using the Amplitude Spectral Area (AMSA) technique. METHODS: A total 
      of 90 pre-countershock ECG signals were analyzed form an accessible preshosptial 
      cardiac arrest database. A unified predictive model, based on signal processing and 
      machine learning, was developed with time-series and dual-tree complex wavelet 
      transform features. Upon selection of correlated variables, a parametrically 
      optimized support vector machine (SVM) model was trained for predicting outcomes on 
      the test sets. Training and testing was performed with nested 10-fold cross 
      validation and 6-10 features for each test fold. RESULTS: The integrative model 
      performs real-time, short-term (7.8 second) analysis of the Electrocardiogram (ECG). 
      For a total of 90 signals, 34 successful and 56 unsuccessful defibrillations were 
      classified with an average Accuracy and Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) Area 
      Under the Curve (AUC) of 82.2% and 85%, respectively. Incorporation of the end-tidal 
      carbon dioxide signal boosted Accuracy and ROC AUC to 83.3% and 93.8%, respectively, 
      for a smaller dataset containing 48 signals. VF analysis using AMSA resulted in 
      accuracy and ROC AUC of 64.6% and 60.9%, respectively. CONCLUSION: We report the 
      development and first-use of a nontraditional non-linear method of analyzing the VF 
      ECG signal, yielding high predictive accuracies of defibrillation success. 
      Furthermore, incorporation of features from the PetCO2 signal noticeably increased 
      model robustness. These predictive capabilities should further improve with the 
      availability of a larger database.

      An observational study.
PG  - 47
LID - 10.1186/1471-2377-11-47 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Guidelines recommend maintaining the heart rate (HR) of acute stroke 
      patients within physiological limits; data on the frequency and predictors of 
      significant deviations from these limits are scarce. METHODS: Demographical data, 
      stroke risk factors, NIH stroke scale score, lesion size and location, and ECG 
      parameters were prospectively assessed in 256 patients with ischemic stroke. 
      Patients were continuously monitored for at least 24 hours on a certified stroke 
      unit. Tachycardia (HR ≥ 120 bpm) and bradycardia (HR <45 bpm) and cardiac rhythm 
      (sinus rhythm or atrial fibrillation) were documented. We investigated the influence 
      of risk factors on HR disturbances and their respective influence on dependence 
      (modified Rankin Scale ≥ 3 after three months) and mortality. RESULTS: HR ≥ 120 bpm 
      occurred in 39 patients (15%). Stroke severity (larger lesion size/higher 
      NIHSS-score on admission), atrial fibrillation and HR on admission predicted its 
      occurrence. HR <45 bpm occurred in 12 patients (5%) and was predicted by lower HR on 
      admission. Neither HR ≥ 120 nor HR <45 bpm independently predicted poor outcome at 
      three moths. Stroke location had no effect on the occurrence of HR violations. 
      Clinical severity and age remained the only consistent predictors of poor outcome. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Significant tachycardia and bradycardia are frequent phenomena in acute 
      stroke; however they do not independently predict clinical course or outcome. 
      Continuous monitoring allows detecting rhythm disturbances in stroke patients and 
      allows deciding whether urgent medical treatment is necessary.

TI  - ECG Denoising Using Marginalized Particle Extended Kalman Filter With an Automatic 
      Particle Weighting Strategy.
PG  - 635-644
LID - 10.1109/JBHI.2016.2582340 [doi]
AB  - In this paper, a model-based Bayesian filtering framework called the "marginalized 
      particle-extended Kalman filter (MP-EKF) algorithm" is proposed for 
      electrocardiogram (ECG) denoising. This algorithm does not have the extended Kalman 
      filter (EKF) shortcoming in handling non-Gaussian nonstationary situations because 
      of its nonlinear framework. In addition, it has less computational complexity 
      compared with particle filter. This filter improves ECG denoising performance by 
      implementing marginalized particle filter framework while reducing its computational 
      complexity using EKF framework. An automatic particle weighting strategy is also 
      proposed here that controls the reliance of our framework to the acquired 
      measurements. We evaluated the proposed filter on several normal ECGs selected from 
      MIT-BIH normal sinus rhythm database. To do so, artificial white Gaussian and 
      colored noises as well as nonstationary real muscle artifact (MA) noise over a range 
      of low SNRs from 10 to -5 dB were added to these normal ECG segments. The benchmark 
      methods were the EKF and extended Kalman smoother (EKS) algorithms which are the 
      first model-based Bayesian algorithms introduced in the field of ECG denoising. From 
      SNR viewpoint, the experiments showed that in the presence of Gaussian white noise, 
      the proposed framework outperforms the EKF and EKS algorithms in lower input SNRs 
      where the measurements and state model are not reliable. Owing to its nonlinear 
      framework and particle weighting strategy, the proposed algorithm attained better 
      results at all input SNRs in non-Gaussian nonstationary situations (such as presence 
      of pink noise, brown noise, and real MA). In addition, the impact of the proposed 
      filtering method on the distortion of diagnostic features of the ECG was 
      investigated and compared with EKF/EKS methods using an ECG diagnostic distortion 
      measure called the "Multi-Scale Entropy Based Weighted Distortion Measure" or 
      MSEWPRD. The results revealed that our proposed algorithm had the lowest MSEPWRD for 
      all noise types at low input SNRs. Therefore, the morphology and diagnostic 
      information of ECG signals were much better conserved compared with EKF/EKS 
      frameworks, especially in non-Gaussian nonstationary situations.

AB  - QT-RR linear regression consists of two parameters, slope and intercept, and the aim 
      of this study was to evaluate repolarization dynamics using the QT-RR linear 
      regression slope and intercept relationship during 24-h Holter ECG. This study 
      included 466 healthy subjects (54.6 ± 14.6 years; 200 men and 266 women) and 17 
      patients with ventricular arrhythmias, consisted of 10 patients with idiopathic 
      ventricular fibrillation (IVF) and 7 patients with torsades de pointes (TDP). QT and 
      RR intervals were measured from ECG waves based on a 15-s averaged ECG during 24-h 
      Holter recording using an automatic QT analyzing system. The QT interval dependence 
      on the RR interval was analyzed using a linear regression line for each subject 
      ([QT] = A[RR] + B; where A is the slope and B is the y-intercept). The slope of the 
      QT-RR regression line in healthy subjects was significantly greater in women than in 
      men (0.185 ± 0.036 vs. 0.161 ± 0.033, p < 0.001) and the intercept was significantly 
      smaller in women than in men (0.229 ± 0.028 vs. 0.240 ± 0.027, p < 0.001). A scatter 
      diagram of the QT-RR regression line slope and intercept among healthy subjects 
      demonstrated a statistically significant negative correlation (B = -0.62A + 0.34, r 
      = -0.79). Distribution of both scatter diagrams of the slope and the intercept of 
      the QT-RR regression line in patients with IVF and TDP was different from healthy 
      subjects (left corner for IVF and upward shift for TDP). The slope and intercept 
      relationship of the QT-RR linear regression line based on 24-h Holter ECG may become 
      a simple useful marker for abnormality of ventricular repolarization dynamics.

AB  - Metabolic syndrome (MetS) has been linked to a higher prevalence of sudden cardiac 
      death (SCD), but the mechanisms are not well understood. One possible underlying 
      mechanism may be an abnormal modulation of autonomic activity, which can be 
      quantified by analyzing heart rate variability (HRV). Our aim was to investigate the 
      modifications of short-term HRV in an experimental rabbit model during the 
      time-course of MetS development. NZW rabbits were randomly assigned to a control (n 
      = 10) or a MetS group (n = 13), fed 28 weeks with control or high-fat, high-sucrose 
      diets. After anesthesia, a 15-min ECG recording was acquired before diet 
      administration and at weeks 14 and 28. We analyzed short RR time series using 
      time-domain, frequency-domain and nonlinear analyses. A mixed-model factorial ANOVA 
      was used for statistical analysis. Time-domain analysis showed a 52.4% decrease in 
      the standard deviation of heart rate in animals from the MetS group at week 28, but 
      no changes in the rest of parameters. In the frequency domain, we found a 9.7% 
      decrease in the very low frequency and a 380.0% increase of the low frequency bands 
      in MetS animals at week 28, whereas high frequency remained unchanged. Nonlinear 
      analyses showed increased complexity and irregularity of the RR time series in MetS 
      animals.

TI  - Decoupling of QT interval variability from heart rate variability with ageing.
PG  - 1435-48
LID - 10.1088/0967-3334/34/11/1435 [doi]
AB  - Ageing has been associated with changes in cardiac electrophysiology that result in 
      QT interval prolongation. The effect of age on rate-adaptation dynamics of the QT 
      interval is less well understood. The aim of this study was to assess age-related 
      changes in the temporal relationship between QT and RR interval variability. Resting 
      ECG of 20 young and 20 elderly healthy subjects were analyzed. Beat-to-beat RR and 
      QT interval time series were automatically extracted. Coupling between QT and RR was 
      assessed by means of the QT variability index, coherence in the frequency domain, 
      rate-corrected QT interval, cross-multiscale entropy, information based similarity 
      index and joint symbolic dynamics. In addition to QT interval prolongation (433 ± 31 
      versus 405 ± 33 ms, p = 0.008), elderly subjects were characterized by a 
      significantly increased QT variability index (-1.26 ± 0.28 versus -1.52 ± 0.22 ms, p 
      < 0.0001), reduced coherence in high (0.11 ± 0.09 versus 0.29 ± 0.14 ms, p = 0.003), 
      and low frequency bands (0.20 ± 0.16 versus 0.49 ± 0.15 ms, p < 0.0001), reduced 
      information domain synchronization index (0.13 ± 0.07 versus 0.19 ± 0.05 ms, p = 
      0.001) as well as increased entropy and disparity in joint symbolic dynamics of QT 
      and RR interval time series. In conclusion, ageing is associated with decoupling of 
      QT variability from heart rate variability. Complexity analysis in addition to 
      standard metrics may provide additional insight.

TI  - Detection of strict left bundle branch block by neural network and a method to test 
      detection consistency.
PG  - 025005
LID - 10.1088/1361-6579/ab6e55 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop an automatic algorithm to detect strict left bundle branch 
      block (LBBB) on electrocardiograms (ECG) and propose a procedure to test the 
      consistency of neural network detections. APPROACH: The database for the 
      classification of strict LBBB was provided by Telemetric and Holter ECG Warehouse. 
      It contained 10 s ECGs taken from the MADIT-CRT clinical trial. The database was 
      divided into a training dataset (N  =  300, strict LBBB  =  174, non-strict 
      LBBB  =  126) and a test dataset (N  =  302, strict LBBB  =  156, non-strict 
      LBBB  =  146). LBBB-related features were extracted by Philips DXL(™) algorithm, 
      selected by a random forest classifier, and fed into a 5-layer neural network (NN) 
      for the classification of strict LBBB on the training dataset. The performance of NN 
      on the test dataset was compared to two random forest classifiers, an algorithm 
      applying strict LBBB criteria, a wavelet-based approach, and a 
      support-vector-machine approach. The consistency of NN's detection was tested on 549 
      2 min recordings of the PTB diagnostic ECG database. LBBB annotations are not 
      required to measure consistency. MAIN RESULTS: The performance of NN on the test 
      dataset were sensitivity  =  91. 7%, specificity  =  85.6% and accuracy  =  88.7% 
      (PPV  =  87.2%, NPV  =  90.6%). The consistency score of strict-LBBB and 
      non-strict-LBBB detection was 0.9341 and 0.9973 respectively. CONCLUSION: NN 
      achieved the highest specificity, accuracy, and PPV. Using random forest for feature 
      selection and NN for classification increased interpretability and reduced 
      computational cost. The consistency test showed that NN achieved high consistency 
      scores in the detection of strict LBBB. SIGNIFICANCE: This work proposed an approach 
      for selecting features and training NN for the detection of strict LBBB as well as a 
      consistency test for black-box algorithms.

AB  - Feature extraction and classification of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals are 
      necessary for the automatic diagnosis of cardiac diseases. In this study, a novel 
      method based on genetic algorithm-back propagation neural network (GA-BPNN) for 
      classifying ECG signals with feature extraction using wavelet packet decomposition 
      (WPD) is proposed. WPD combined with the statistical method is utilized to extract 
      the effective features of ECG signals. The statistical features of the wavelet 
      packet coefficients are calculated as the feature sets. GA is employed to decrease 
      the dimensions of the feature sets and to optimize the weights and biases of the 
      back propagation neural network (BPNN). Thereafter, the optimized BPNN classifier is 
      applied to classify six types of ECG signals. In addition, an experimental platform 
      is constructed for ECG signal acquisition to supply the ECG data for verifying the 
      effectiveness of the proposed method. The GA-BPNN method with the MIT-BIH arrhythmia 
      database achieved a dimension reduction of nearly 50% and produced good 
      classification results with an accuracy of 97.78%. The experimental results based on 
      the established acquisition platform indicated that the GA-BPNN method achieved a 
      high classification accuracy of 99.33% and could be efficiently applied in the 
      automatic identification of cardiac arrhythmias.

      free precession cardiovascular magnetic resonance at 3.0 Tesla.
PG  - 32
LID - 10.1186/1532-429X-15-32 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study proposed a fast and fully automatic calibration system to 
      suppress the dark banding artifacts in balanced steady-state free precession (bSSFP) 
      cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) at 3.0 T. METHODS: Twenty-one healthy 
      volunteers (18 men, 3 women; mean age 24.9 years) participated in this study after 
      providing institutionally approved consent. The optimal frequency was obtained using 
      sweep scans of transition-band low flip-angle bSSFP (bSSFP-L), performed with three 
      conditions: breath-hold plus electrocardiography (ECG) triggering (BH + ECG), 
      breath-hold only (BH), and free breathing (FB). A real-time feedback system was 
      implemented to allow the performing of bSSFP-L calibration scanning and conventional 
      cine bSSFP within one breath-hold. For each scan condition, the optimal phase was 
      estimated using 20-point and 10-point spline fitting. RESULTS: Linear regression 
      analysis indicated high correlation between the optimal phases obtained using BH and 
      FB and those obtained using BH + ECG (R2 = 0.91 to 0.98, n = 21). The optimal phases 
      obtained using 10-point datasets showed high correlation with the 20-point BH + ECG 
      datasets (R2 = 0.92 to 0.99, n = 21); although the within-subject coefficient of 
      variation (wsCV) was larger using 10-point fitting. The variation of repeated 
      measurements was largest with FB acquisition and smallest with BH + ECG acquisition. 
      The optimal frequency obtained by offline calculation and by real-time feedback 
      calibration significantly reduced dark-band artifacts in cine bSSFP images (both 
      p < .01). CONCLUSIONS: The proposed real-time feedback calibration method for bSSFP 
      imaging is rapid and fully automatic. This method could greatly reduce dark-band 
      artifacts in bSSFP images and facilitate clinical CMR at 3.0 T.

TI  - Relationships between heart-rate variability and pulse-rate variability obtained 
      from video-PPG signal using ZCA.
PG  - 1934-1944
AB  - In this paper, classical time- and frequency-domain variability indexes obtained by 
      pulse rate variability (PRV) series extracted from video-photoplethysmography 
      signals (vPPG) were compared with heart rate variability (HRV) parameters extracted 
      from ECG signals. The study focuses on the analysis of the changes observed during a 
      rest-to-stand manoeuvre (a mild sympathetic stimulus) performed on 60 young, normal 
      subjects (age: [Formula: see text] years). The objective is to evaluate if 
      video-derived PRV indexes may replace HRV in the assessment of autonomic responses 
      to external stimulation. Video recordings were performed with a GigE Sony XCG-C30C 
      camera and analyzed offline to extract the vPPG signal. A new method based on 
      zero-phase component analysis (ZCA) was employed in combination with a 
      fully-automatic method for detection and tracking of region of interest (ROI) 
      located on the forehead, the cheek and the nose. Results show an overall agreement 
      between time and frequency domain indexes computed on HRV and PRV series. However, 
      some differences exist between resting and standing conditions. During rest, all the 
      indexes computed on HRV and PRV series were not statistically significantly 
      different (p  >  0.05), and showed high correlation (Pearson's r  >  0.90). The 
      agreement decreases during standing, especially for the high-frequency, 
      respiration-related parameters such as RMSSD (r  =  0.75), pNN50 (r  =  0.68) and HF 
      power (r  =  0.76). Finally, the power in the LF band (n.u.) was observed to 
      increase significantly during standing by both HRV ([Formula: see text] versus 
      [Formula: see text] (n.u.); rest versus standing) and PRV ([Formula: see text] 
      versus [Formula: see text](n.u.); rest versus standing) analysis, but such an 
      increase was lower in PRV parameters than that observed by HRV indexes. These 
      results provide evidence that some differences exist between variability indexes 
      extracted from HRV and video-derived PRV, mainly in the HF band during standing. 
      However, despite these differences video-derived PRV indexes were able to evince the 
      autonomic responses expected by the sympathetic stimulation induced by the 
      rest-to-stand manoeuvre.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Automatic processing and accurate diagnosis of wide 
      complex tachycardia (WCT) arrhythmia groups using electrocardiogram signals (ECG) 
      remains a challenge. WCT arrhythmia consists of two main groups: ventricular 
      tachycardia (VT) and supraventricular tachycardia with aberrancy (SVT-A). These two 
      groups have similar morphologies in the realm of ECG signals. VT and SVT-A 
      arrhythmias originate from the ventricle and atrium, respectively. Hence, inaccurate 
      diagnosis of SVT-A instead of VT can be fatal. METHODS: In this paper, we present a 
      novel algorithm using dynamic time warping (DTW) to discriminate between VT and 
      SVT-A arrhythmias. This method includes pre-processing, best template search (BTS), 
      and classifier modules. The first module, pre-processing, is responsible for 
      filtering, R-wave detection, and beat detection of ECG signals. The second module, 
      BTS, automatically extracts the minimum possible number of signals as a template 
      from the entire training dataset using an intelligent algorithm. These template 
      signals have the greatest morphological difference, which leads to accurate WCT 
      discrimination. Finally, a 1NN classifier categorizes the test data using DTW 
      distance. RESULTS: Our proposed method was evaluated on an ECG signal database 
      consisting of 171 subjects. The results showed that the proposed algorithm can 
      accurately discriminate between VT, SVT-A, and normal subjects, and appears to be 
      suitable for future use in clinical application. The obtained accuracy, sensitivity, 
      specificity, and positive predictive values were 93.22%, 88.68%, 96.98%, and 90.27%, 
      respectively. CONCLUSION: The presented diagnostic method for discriminating VT and 
      SVT-A, using only one ECG lead, is suitable for future clinical use. It can reduce 
      needless therapeutic interventions and minimize risk for patients.

LID - 10.1109/EMBC.2019.8856450 [doi]
AB  - Advancements in wireless sensor networks (WSN) technology and miniaturization of 
      wearable sensors have enabled long-term continuous pervasive biomedical signal 
      monitoring. Wrist-worn photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors have gained popularity 
      given their form factor. However the signal quality suffers due to motion artifacts 
      when used in ambulatory settings, making vital parameter estimation a challenging 
      task. In this paper, we present a novel deep learning framework, BioTranslator, for 
      computing the instantaneous heart rate (IHR), using wrist-worn PPG signals collected 
      during physical activity. Using one-dimensional Convolution-Deconvolution Network, 
      we translate a single channel PPG signal to an electrocardiogram(ECG)-like time 
      series signal, from which relevant R-peak information can be inferred enabling IHR 
      measures. The proposed network configuration was evaluated on 12 subjects of the 
      TROIKA dataset, involved in physical activity. The proposed network identifies 92.8% 
      of R-peaks, besides achieving a mean absolute error of 51±6.3ms with respect to 
      reference ECG-derived IHR.

LID - 10.1109/EMBC.2016.7592192 [doi]
AB  - An automated patient-specific system to classify the level of sedation in ICU 
      patients using heart rate variability signal is presented in this paper. ECG from 70 
      mechanically ventilated adult patients with administered sedatives in an ICU setting 
      were used to develop a support vector machine based system for sedation depth 
      monitoring using several heart rate variability measures. A leave-one-subject-out 
      cross validation was used for classifier training and performance evaluations. The 
      proposed patient-specific system provided a sensitivity, specificity and an AUC of 
      64%, 84.8% and 0.72, respectively. It is hoped that with the help of additional 
      physiological signals the proposed patient-specific sedation level prediction system 
      could lead to a fully automated multimodal system to assist clinical staff in ICUs 
      to interpret the sedation level of the patient.

AB  - We investigated cardio-respiratory coupling in patients with heart failure by 
      quantification of bidirectional interactions between cardiac (RR intervals) and 
      respiratory signals with complementary measures of time series analysis. Heart 
      failure patients were divided into three groups of twenty, age and gender matched, 
      subjects: with sinus rhythm (HF-Sin), with sinus rhythm and ventricular 
      extrasystoles (HF-VES), and with permanent atrial fibrillation (HF-AF). We included 
      patients with indication for implantation of implantable cardioverter defibrillator 
      or cardiac resynchronization therapy device. ECG and respiratory signals were 
      simultaneously acquired during 20 min in supine position at spontaneous breathing 
      frequency in 20 healthy control subjects and in patients before device implantation. 
      We used coherence, Granger causality and cross-sample entropy analysis as 
      complementary measures of bidirectional interactions between RR intervals and 
      respiratory rhythm. In heart failure patients with arrhythmias (HF-VES and HF-AF) 
      there is no coherence between signals (p < 0.01), while in HF-Sin it is reduced (p < 
      0.05), compared with control subjects. In all heart failure groups causality between 
      signals is diminished, but with significantly stronger causality of RR signal in 
      respiratory signal in HF-VES. Cross-sample entropy analysis revealed the strongest 
      synchrony between respiratory and RR signal in HF-VES group. Beside respiratory 
      sinus arrhythmia there is another type of cardio-respiratory interaction based on 
      the synchrony between cardiac and respiratory rhythm. Both of them are altered in 
      heart failure patients. Respiratory sinus arrhythmia is reduced in HF-Sin patients 
      and vanished in heart failure patients with arrhythmias. Contrary, in HF-Sin and 
      HF-VES groups, synchrony increased, probably as consequence of some dominant neural 
      compensatory mechanisms. The coupling of cardiac and respiratory rhythm in heart 
      failure patients varies depending on the presence of atrial/ventricular arrhythmias 
      and it could be revealed by complementary methods of time series analysis.

AB  - An automatic algorithm for processing simultaneously acquired electrocardiogram 
      (ECG) and oximetry signals that identifies epochs of pure central apnoea, epochs 
      containing obstructive apnoea and epochs of normal breathing is presented. The 
      algorithm uses time and spectral features from the ECG derived heart-rate and 
      respiration information, as well as features capturing desaturations from the 
      oximeter sensor. Evaluation of performance of the system was achieved by using 
      leave-one-record-out cross validation on the St. Vincent's University Hospital / 
      University College Dublin Sleep Apnea Database from the Physionet collections of 
      recorded physiologic signals. When classifying the three epoch types, our system 
      achieved a specificity of 80%, a sensitivity to central apnoea of 44% and 
      sensitivity to obstructive apnoea of 35%. A sensitivity of 81% was achieved when the 
      central and obstructive epochs were combined into one class.

TI  - P wave detection and delineation in the ECG based on the phase free stationary 
      wavelet transform and using intracardiac atrial electrograms as reference.
PG  - 37-56
LID - 10.1515/bmt-2014-0161 [doi]
AB  - Robust and exact automatic P wave detection and delineation in the electrocardiogram 
      (ECG) is still an interesting but challenging research topic. The early prognosis of 
      cardiac afflictions such as atrial fibrillation and the response of a patient to a 
      given treatment is believed to improve if the P wave is carefully analyzed during 
      sinus rhythm. Manual annotation of the signals is a tedious and subjective task. Its 
      correctness depends on the experience of the annotator, quality of the signal, and 
      ECG lead. In this work, we present a wavelet-based algorithm to detect and delineate 
      P waves in individual ECG leads. We evaluated a large group of commonly used 
      wavelets and frequency bands (wavelet levels) and introduced a special phase free 
      wavelet transformation. The local extrema of the transformed signals are directly 
      related to the delineating points of the P wave. First, the algorithm was studied 
      using synthetic signals. Then, the optimal parameter configuration was found using 
      intracardiac electrograms and surface ECGs measured simultaneously. The reverse 
      biorthogonal wavelet 3.3 was found to be optimal for this application. In the end, 
      the method was validated using the QT database from PhysioNet. We showed that the 
      algorithm works more accurately and more robustly than other methods presented in 
      literature. The validation study delivered an average delineation error of the P 
      wave onset of -0.32±12.41 ms when compared to manual annotations. In conclusion, the 
      algorithm is suitable for handling varying P wave shapes and low signal-to-noise 
      ratios.

TI  - Orthostatic hypotension before and after meal intake in diabetic patients and 
      healthy elderly people.
PG  - 20-5
LID - 10.4103/2230-8229.94007 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The symptoms of orthostatic hypotension may be ignored or go unnoticed 
      and may predispose some diabetic or elderly people to repeated falls and trauma, 
      leading to immobility and prolongation of rehabilitation. The present investigation 
      is concerned mainly with testing the reaction of the cardiovascular system in 
      response to physiological stimuli, such as, standing upright from a supine position 
      before and after meal intake in diabetic patients and the healthy Saudi population. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy-five healthy and 49 diabetic patients were selected 
      for this study. Parameters of heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, 
      and electrocardiograms (ECG) were obtained for each subject by Dinamap (an automatic 
      recorder), after 10 minutes of rest in the supine position and then after one and 
      two minutes of standing. All parameters were taken before and after an intake of a 
      standard meal. The results were compared between the diabetic and non-diabetic 
      groups, and between the elderly diabetic and the healthy elderly ≥ 65 year olds, and 
      between the young adults ≤ 40 year olds and the elderly ≥ 65 year olds. RESULTS: The 
      postural changes of blood pressure and heart rate between the diabetic and 
      non-diabetic groups, and between the elderly diabetic and the healthy elderly 
      groups, were not significant. However, a highly significant postural drop in blood 
      pressure, and an increase in the resting heart rate were recorded before and after a 
      meal intake in the elderly compared to the young adults. CONCLUSION: The highly 
      significant postural drop in blood pressure and increase in the resting heart rate 
      in the elderly diabetic and healthy elderly people can be attributed to a defect in 
      the arterial baroreceptors control of blood pressure and parasympathetic control of 
      heart rate in this population.

AB  - This paper presents automatic detection and localization of myocardial infarction 
      (MI) using K-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier. Time domain features of each beat in 
      the ECG signal such as T wave amplitude, Q wave and ST level deviation, which are 
      indicative of MI, are extracted from 12 leads ECG. Detection of MI aims to classify 
      normal subjects without myocardial infarction and subjects suffering from Myocardial 
      Infarction. For further investigation, Localization of MI is done to specify the 
      region of infarction of the heart. Total 20,160 ECG beats from PTB database 
      available on Physio-bank is used to investigate the performance of extracted 
      features with KNN classifier. In the case of MI detection, sensitivity and 
      specificity of KNN is found to be 99.9% using half of the randomly selected beats as 
      training set and rest of the beats for testing. Moreover, Arif-Fayyaz pruning 
      algorithm is used to prune the data which will reduce the storage requirement and 
      computational cost of search. After pruning, sensitivity and specificity are dropped 
      to 97% and 99.6% respectively but training is reduced by 93%. Myocardial Infarction 
      beats are divided into ten classes based on the location of the infarction along 
      with one class of normal subjects. Sensitivity and Specificity of above 90% is 
      achieved for all eleven classes with overall classification accuracy of 98.8%. Some 
      of the ECG beats are misclassified but interestingly these are misclassified to 
      those classes whose location of infarction is near to the true classes of the ECG 
      beats. Pruning is done on the training set for eleven classes and training set is 
      reduced by 70% and overall classification accuracy of 98.3% is achieved. The 
      proposed method due to its simplicity and high accuracy over the PTB database can be 
      very helpful in correct diagnosis of MI in a practical scenario.

AB  - An electrocardiogram (ECG) measures the electric activity of the heart and has been 
      widely used for detecting heart diseases due to its simplicity and non-invasive 
      nature. By analyzing the electrical signal of each heartbeat, i.e., the combination 
      of action impulse waveforms produced by different specialized cardiac tissues found 
      in the heart, it is possible to detect some of its abnormalities. In the last 
      decades, several works were developed to produce automatic ECG-based heartbeat 
      classification methods. In this work, we survey the current state-of-the-art methods 
      of ECG-based automated abnormalities heartbeat classification by presenting the ECG 
      signal preprocessing, the heartbeat segmentation techniques, the feature description 
      methods and the learning algorithms used. In addition, we describe some of the 
      databases used for evaluation of methods indicated by a well-known standard 
      developed by the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) 
      and described in ANSI/AAMI EC57:1998/(R)2008 (ANSI/AAMI, 2008). Finally, we discuss 
      limitations and drawbacks of the methods in the literature presenting concluding 
      remarks and future challenges, and also we propose an evaluation process workflow to 
      guide authors in future works.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A fraction of routine resting ECG's are taken with electrode positions 
      interchanged, leading to possible clinical misinterpretation. OBJECTIVE: Develop and 
      test a method to detect and prevent electrode reversals at the electrocardiograph 
      before the ECG is acquired. METHOD: The algorithm is based on QRS axis and P 
      amplitudes for limb electrode reversals, and P-Q-RS amplitude distances to detect 
      chest electrode reversals. The evaluation method involved a large (>18,000) hospital 
      database for which serial ECG's were available and was based on simulated 
      juxtapositions. RESULTS: The 7 most common lead reversals could be detected with a 
      specificity of 99.8% per type and an average sensitivity of 90%, excluding LA-LL 
      reversal (22% sensitivity). DISCUSSION: Results are similar to retrospective studies 
      that used smaller, more homogeneous datasets. CONCLUSION: The early warning system 
      reduces the ECG's recorded with reversal by 80%, at the price of a modest false 
      alert rate of 1.4%.

      patients.
PG  - 193-7
LID - 10.1258/jtt.2012.111005 [doi]
AB  - We assessed ECGs recorded during home-based telemonitored cardiac rehabilitation 
      (HTCR) in stable patients with heart-failure. The study included 75 patients with 
      heart failure (NYHA II, III), with a mean age of 56 years. They participated in an 
      eight-week programme of home cardiac rehabilitation which was telemonitored with a 
      device which recorded 16-s fragments of their ECG. These fragments were transmitted 
      via mobile phone to a monitoring centre. The times of the automatic ECG recordings 
      were pre-set and coordinated with the cardiac rehabilitation. Patients were able to 
      make additional recordings when they felt unwell using a tele-event-Holter ECG 
      facility. During the study, 5757 HTCR sessions were recorded and 11,534 transmitted 
      ECG fragments were evaluated. Most ECGs originated from the automatic recordings. 
      Singular supraventricular and ventricular premature beats and ventricular couplets 
      were detected in 16%, 69% and 16% of patients, respectively. Twenty ECGs were 
      recorded when patients felt unwell: non sustained ventricular tachycardia occurred 
      in three patients and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation episode in two patients. Heart 
      failure patients undergoing HTCR did not develop any arrhythmia which required a 
      change of the procedure, confirming it was safe. Cardiac rehabilitation at home was 
      improved by utilizing the tele-event-Holter ECG facility.

PG  - 1420-6
LID - 10.1093/europace/euv379 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: In order to improve the electrocardiographic (ECG) diagnosis of arrhythmogenic 
      right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC), we evaluated novel quantitative parameters 
      of the QRS complex and the value of bipolar chest leads (CF leads) computed from the 
      standard 12 leads. METHODS AND RESULTS: We analysed digital 12-lead ECGs in 44 
      patients with ARVC, 276 healthy subjects including 44 age and sex-matched with the 
      patients and 36 genotyped members of ARVC families. The length and area of the 
      terminal S wave in V1 to V3 were measured automatically using a common for all 12 
      leads QRS end. T wave negativity was assessed in V1 to V6 and in the bipolar CF 
      leads computed from the standard 12 leads. The length and area of the terminal S 
      wave were significantly shorter, whereas the S wave duration was significantly 
      longer in ARVC patients compared with matched controls. Among members of ARVC 
      families, those with mutations (n = 15) had shorter QRS length in V2 and V3 and 
      smaller QRS area in lead V2 compared with those without mutations (n = 20). In ARVC 
      patients, the CF leads were diagnostically superior to the standard unipolar 
      precordial leads. Terminal S wave duration in V1 >48 ms or major T wave negativity 
      in CF leads separated ARVC patients from matched controls with 90% sensitivity and 
      86% specificity. CONCLUSION: The terminal S wave length and area in the right 
      precordial leads are diagnostically useful and suitable for automatic analysis in 
      ARVC. The CF leads are diagnostically superior to the unipolar precordial leads.

      cleaning.
PG  - 382-9
LID - 10.4037/ajcc2013365 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nosocomial infections caused by multidrug-resistant organisms are 
      commonly associated with longer hospital stays up to 12 to 18 days and annual 
      estimated costs of $5.7 billion to $6.8 billion. One common mode of transmission is 
      cross-contamination between patients and providers via surface contaminants on 
      devices such as telemetry systems. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effect of a cleaning 
      protocol on colonization of surface contaminants on electrocardiographic telemetry 
      systems in 4 cardiovascular step-down units and to compare colonization in medical 
      vs surgical units. METHODS: A prospective, randomized, case-controlled study (the 
      Descriptive Evaluation of Electrocardiographic Telemetry Pathogens [DEET] study) was 
      designed to evaluate microbial colonization on telemetry systems before and after 
      cleaning with sodium hypochlorite wipes. Each randomly selected telemetry system 
      served as its own control. Nurses used a standardized culture technique recommended 
      by personnel in infection control. Colonization before and after cleaning was 
      analyzed by using the McNemar test and frequency tables. A standard cost-comparison 
      analysis was conducted. RESULTS: A total of 30 telemetry systems in medical units 
      and 29 in surgical units were evaluated; 41 telemetry systems (69%) were colonized 
      before the intervention, and 14 (24%) were colonized after it (P < .001). Before 
      cleaning, surface organisms were present in 14 instances (35%) in surgical units and 
      in 27 instances (66%) in medical units (P < .001). The cleaning strategy was 
      cost-effective. CONCLUSIONS: The cleaning intervention was effective, and 
      cost-comparison analysis supported implementing a cleaning strategy for reusable 
      leads rather than investing in disposable leads.

AB  - This study proposes a new method, equal frequency in amplitude and equal width in 
      time (EFiA-EWiT) discretization, to discriminate between congestive heart failure 
      (CHF) and normal sinus rhythm (NSR) patterns in ECG signals. The ECG unit pattern 
      concept was introduced to represent the standard RR interval, and our method 
      extracted certain features from the unit patterns to classify by a primitive 
      classifier. The proposed method was tested on two classification experiments by 
      using ECG records in Physiobank databases and the results were compared to those 
      from several previous studies. In the first experiment, an off-line classification 
      was performed with unit patterns selected from long ECG segments. The method was 
      also used to detect CHF by real-time ECG waveform analysis. In addition to 
      demonstrating the success of the proposed method, the results showed that some unit 
      patterns in a long ECG segment from a heart patient were more suggestive of disease 
      than the others. These results indicate that the proposed approach merits additional 
      research.

AB  - Our ability to directly monitor the mechanisms that govern cellular function, oxygen 
      use, and survival is minimal. Therefore, in critically ill children, surrogate 
      markers are used to try to detect evolving or established hypoxia. These surrogate 
      markers are best used in combination and are complementary to clinical examination. 
      Regardless of resource limitations, we propose that the availability of certain 
      monitoring tools form a standard of care without which pediatric cardiac critical 
      care cannot be safely or optimally provided. These tools include standard invasive 
      hemodynamic monitoring with electrocardiography, lactate measurement, central venous 
      oxygen saturation, and echocardiography. Ultimately, monitoring is only useful when 
      the clinician observes a specific value or trend and has the expertise to act 
      appropriately.

AB  - Interest in the effects of drugs on the heart rate-corrected JTpeak (JTpc) interval 
      from the body-surface ECG has spawned an increasing number of scientific 
      investigations in the field of regulatory sciences, and more specifically in the 
      context of the Comprehensive in vitro Proarrhythmia Assay (CiPA) initiative. We 
      conducted a novel initiative to evaluate the role of automatic JTpc measurement 
      technologies by comparing their ability to distinguish multi- from single-channel 
      blocking drugs. A set of 5232 ECGs was shared by the FDA (through the Telemetric and 
      Holter ECG Warehouse) with 3 ECG device companies (AMPS, Mortara, and Philips). We 
      evaluated the differences in drug-concentration effects on these measurements 
      between the commercial and the FDA technologies. We provide a description of the 
      drug-induced placebo-corrected changes from baseline for dofetilide, quinidine, 
      ranolazine, and verapamil, and discuss the various differences across all 
      technologies. The results revealed only small differences between measurement 
      technologies evaluated in this study. It also confirms that, in this dataset, the 
      JTpc interval distinguishes between multi- and single-channel (hERG) blocking drugs 
      when evaluating the effects of dofetilide, quinidine, ranolazine, and verapamil. 
      However, in the case of quinidine and dofetilide, we noticed a poor consistency 
      across technologies because of the lack of standard definitions for the location of 
      the peak of the T-wave (T-apex) when the T-wave morphology is abnormal.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The autonomic behavior of growth-restricted fetuses at different 
      evolving hemodynamic stages has not been fully elicited. AIM: To analyze the 
      respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) of growth-restricted fetuses that despite this 
      severe condition show normal Doppler hemodynamics. SUBJECTS: 10 growth-restricted 
      fetuses (FGR group) with normal arterial pulsatility indices (umbilical, uterine, 
      middle cerebral, ductus venosus and aortic isthmus), and 10 healthy fetuses (Control 
      group), 32-37weeks of gestation. METHOD: B-mode ultrasound images for visualizing 
      fetal breathing movements (FBM) or breathing akinesis (FBA), and the simultaneous 
      RR-interval time series from maternal abdominal ECG recordings were obtained. The 
      root-mean-square of successive differences of RR-intervals (RMSSD) was considered as 
      a RSA-related parameter among the instantaneous amplitude of the high-frequency 
      component (AMPHF) and its corresponding instantaneous frequency (IFHF), both 
      computed by using empirical mode decomposition. Mean fetal heart-periods and 
      RSA-related parameters were assessed during episodes of FBM and FBA in 30s length 
      windows. RESULTS: FGR and Control groups presented RSA-related fluctuations during 
      FBM and FBA. Also, both groups showed significant higher (p<0.001) values for the 
      mean heart-period, RMSSD and AMPHF during FBM. No-significant differences (p>0.05) 
      were found for the IFHF regardless of breathing activity (FBM vs. FBA). CONCLUSION: 
      Growth-restricted fetuses without evident hemodynamic compromise exhibit a preserved 
      autonomic cardiovascular regulation, characterized by higher values of RSA and mean 
      heart-period in the presence of FBM. This physiological response reflects a 
      compensatory strategy that may contribute to preserve blood flow redistribution to 
      vital organs.

PG  - 275-88
AB  - In 9 students the ECG, the respirogram, the EOG, the auditomotor and optomotor 
      reaction times, and the reproduction of 10-digit numbers from the immediate memory 
      (repeated at intervals of 15 sec) were investigated in 25 experiments of 20 min 
      prior to and following p.o. application of 7.5-10 mg diazepam. The autocorrelation 
      function and the power spectrum from about 200 time series were computed, and the 
      frequencies found were verified in the range from 0.2-2.0 min-1. From all possible 
      digit number relations of frequencies (restricted by definite criteria) between the 
      investigated physiological oscillations, the portion of realized synchronizations 
      was calculated as the degree of coupling. The minute-rhythmic coupling degree was 
      found to increase significantly from 41 to 59 per cent under acute influence of 
      diazepam. The heart rate, the respiratory rate and the reaction times did not change 
      significantly. The immediate reproduction power proved significantly diminished. The 
      results are discussed in regard to the facilitated rhythmic synchronization 
      connected with an anxiolytic tranquilizing and sedative-hypmotic action of diazepam.

TI  - Monitoring Haloperidol Plasma Concentration and Associated Adverse Events in 
      Critically Ill Children With Delirium: First Results of a Clinical Protocol Aimed to 
      Monitor Efficacy and Safety.
PG  - e112-e119
LID - 10.1097/PCC.0000000000001414 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: As delirium in critically ill children is increasingly recognized, more 
      children are treated with the antipsychotic drug haloperidol, while current dosing 
      guidelines are lacking solid evidence and appear to be associated with a high risk 
      of adverse events. We aim to report on the safety and efficacy of a recently 
      implemented clinical dose-titration protocol with active monitoring of adverse 
      events. DESIGN: From July 2014 until June 2015, when a potential delirium was 
      identified by regular delirium scores and confirmed by a child psychiatrist, 
      haloperidol was prescribed according to the Dutch Pediatric Formulary. Daily, 
      adverse events were systematically assessed, haloperidol plasma concentrations were 
      measured, and delirium symptoms followed. Dependent on the clinical response, plasma 
      concentration, and adverse event, the dose was adjusted. SETTING: A 28-bed tertiary 
      PICU in the Netherlands. PATIENTS: All patients admitted to the PICU diagnosed with 
      delirium. INTERVENTION: Treatment with haloperidol according to a dose-titration 
      protocol MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS:: Thirteen children (median age [range] 8.3 
      yr [0.4-13.8 yr]) received haloperidol, predominantly IV (median dose [range] 
      0.027 mg/kg/d [0.005-0.085 mg/kg/d]). In all patients, pediatric delirium resolved, 
      but five of 13 patients developed possible adverse event. These were reversed after 
      biperiden (n = 2), discontinuing (n = 3), and/or lowering the dose (n = 3). Plasma 
      concentrations were all below the presumed therapeutic threshold of 3-12 µg/L. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Prospective systematic monitoring of adverse event in critically ill 
      children receiving haloperidol revealed a significant proportion of possible adverse 
      events. Adverse event developed despite low plasma concentrations and recommended 
      dose administration in the majority of the patients. Our data suggest that 
      haloperidol can potentially improve pediatric delirium, but it might also put 
      patients at risk for developing adverse events.

AB  - BACKGROUND: heart rate variability (HRV) is a noninvasive diagnostic method used in 
      the assessment of the autonomic modulation of the heart. The assessment of HRV using 
      nonlinear dynamics methods in the preoperative period of surgical myocardial 
      revascularization could be predictive of morbidity such as pulmonary infections in 
      the postoperative period. OBJECTIVE: to evaluate the behavior of HRV using nonlinear 
      dynamics in the preoperative period of surgical myocardial revascularization and its 
      relation to the occurrence of pulmonary infections in the in-hospital postoperative 
      period. METHODS: a total of 69 patients with coronary artery disease (mean age of 
      58.6 ± 10.4 years) and indication for elective surgical myocardial revascularization 
      were studied. In order to quantify the nonlinear dynamics of HRV, the following 
      procedures were performed: detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA); analysis of the 
      short (α1) and long-term (α2) components of DFA; approximate entropy (ApEn); 
      Lyapunov exponent (LE); and Hurst exponent (HE) of time series of RR intervals of 
      the ECG, as captured by the Polar S810i instrument on the day before surgery. 
      RESULTS: at the cut-off levels set by the ROC curve, there was a significant 
      difference between the groups with and without pulmonary infections in the 
      postoperative period of myocardial revascularization for total DFA, approximate 
      entropy and Lyapunov exponent with p = 0. 0309, p = 0.0307 and p = 0.0006, 
      respectively. CONCLUSION: the nonlinear dynamics methods, at their respective 
      cut-off levels, allowed for the identification of patients developing pulmonary 
      infection in the postoperative period of surgical myocardial revascularization, thus 
      suggesting that these methods may have a prognostic value for this group of 
      patients.

TI  - A novel algorithm for reducing false arrhythmia alarms in intensive care units.
PG  - 2525-2528
LID - 10.1109/EMBC.2016.7591244 [doi]
AB  - Alarm fatigue in intensive care units (ICU) is one of the top healthcare issues in 
      the US. False alarms in ICU will decrease the quality of care and staff response 
      time over the alarms. Normally, false alarm will cause desensitization of the 
      clinical staff which leads to warnings and misleading, if the triggered alarm is 
      true. In this study, we have proposed a multi-model ensemble approach to reduce the 
      false alarm rate in monitoring systems. We have used 750 patient records from 
      PhysioNet database. At First arrhythmia based features from electrocardiogram (ECG), 
      arterial blood pressure (ABP) and photoplethysmogram (PPG) features were extracted 
      from the records. Next, the dataset has been separated into two subsets on the basis 
      of available features information. The first dataset (DS1) is the combination of ECG 
      physiological, ABP and PPG features. Their correlation coefficient and p-values 
      criteria have been applied for relevant alarm-wise feature-set selection, and random 
      forest classifier was used for model development and validation. The threshold based 
      approach was used on second dataset (DS2) which is the combination of arrhythmia, 
      ABP and PPG features. The developed ensemble model is able to achieve sensitivity 
      83.33-100 % (average 95.56 %) being true alarms and suppress false alarms rate 
      66.67-89% (average 77.25%). The predictability of classifier shows the advantage to 
      deal with unbalanced set of information, therefore overall model performance has 
      reached to 83.96% accuracy.

TI  - Reducing false alarms in the ICU by quantifying self-similarity of multimodal 
      biosignals.
PG  - 1233-52
LID - 10.1088/0967-3334/37/8/1233 [doi]
AB  - False arrhythmia alarms pose a major threat to the quality of care in today's ICU. 
      Thus, the PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2015 aimed at reducing false 
      alarms by exploiting multimodal cardiac signals recorded by a patient monitor. False 
      alarms for asystole, extreme bradycardia, extreme tachycardia, ventricular 
      flutter/fibrillation as well as ventricular tachycardia were to be reduced using two 
      electrocardiogram channels, up to two cardiac signals of mechanical origin as well 
      as a respiratory signal. In this paper, an approach combining multimodal rhythmicity 
      estimation and machine learning is presented. Using standard short-time 
      autocorrelation and robust beat-to-beat interval estimation, the signal's 
      self-similarity is analyzed. In particular, beat intervals as well as quality 
      measures are derived which are further quantified using basic mathematical 
      operations (min, mean, max, etc). Moreover, methods from the realm of image 
      processing, 2D Fourier transformation combined with principal component analysis, 
      are employed for dimensionality reduction. Several machine learning approaches are 
      evaluated including linear discriminant analysis and random forest. Using an 
      alarm-independent reduction strategy, an overall false alarm reduction with a score 
      of 65.52 in terms of the real-time scoring system of the challenge is achieved on a 
      hidden dataset. Employing an alarm-specific strategy, an overall real-time score of 
      78.20 at a true positive rate of 95% and a true negative rate of 78% is achieved. 
      While the results for some categories still need improvement, false alarms for 
      extreme tachycardia are suppressed with 100% sensitivity and specificity.

PG  - 706-717
LID - 10.1145/2971648.2971753 [doi]
AB  - Differential privacy concepts have been successfully used to protect anonymity of 
      individuals in population-scale analysis. Sharing of mobile sensor data, especially 
      physiological data, raise different privacy challenges, that of protecting private 
      behaviors that can be revealed from time series of sensor data. Existing privacy 
      mechanisms rely on noise addition and data perturbation. But the accuracy 
      requirement on inferences drawn from physiological data, together with 
      well-established limits within which these data values occur, render traditional 
      privacy mechanisms inapplicable. In this work, we define a new behavioral privacy 
      metric based on differential privacy and propose a novel data substitution mechanism 
      to protect behavioral privacy. We evaluate the efficacy of our scheme using 660 
      hours of ECG, respiration, and activity data collected from 43 participants and 
      demonstrate that it is possible to retain meaningful utility, in terms of inference 
      accuracy (90%), while simultaneously preserving the privacy of sensitive behaviors.

TI  - Delayed time to defibrillation after intraoperative and periprocedural cardiac 
      arrest.
PG  - 782-93
LID - 10.1097/ALN.0b013e3181eaa74f [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Delay in defibrillation (more than 2 min) is associated with worse 
      survival in patients with a cardiac arrest because of ventricular fibrillation or 
      pulseless ventricular tachycardia in intensive care units and inpatient wards. 
      METHODS: We tested the relationship between delayed defibrillation and survival from 
      intraoperative or periprocedural cardiac arrest, adjusting for baseline patient 
      characteristics. The analysis was based on data from 865 patients who had 
      intraoperative or periprocedural cardiac arrest caused by ventricular fibrillation 
      or pulseless ventricular tachycardia in 259 hospitals participating in the National 
      Registry of Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation. RESULTS: The median time to 
      defibrillation was less than 1 min (interquartile range, <1 to 1 min). Delays in 
      defibrillation occurred in 119 patients (13.8%). Characteristics associated with 
      delayed defibrillation included pulseless ventricular tachycardia and noncardiac 
      admitting diagnosis. The association between delayed defibrillation and survival to 
      hospital discharge differed for periprocedural and intraoperative cardiac arrests (P 
      value for interaction = 0.003). For patients arresting outside the operating room, 
      delayed defibrillation was associated with a lower probability of surviving to 
      hospital discharge (31.6% vs. 62.1%, adjusted odds ratio 0.49; 95% CI 0.27, 0.88; P 
      = 0.018). In contrast, delayed defibrillation was not associated with survival for 
      cardiac arrests in the operating room (46.8% vs. 39.6%, adjusted odds ratio 1.23, 
      95% CI 0.70, 2.19, P = 0.47). CONCLUSIONS: Delays in defibrillation occurred in one 
      of seven cardiac arrests in the intraoperative and periprocedural arenas. Although 
      delayed defibrillation was associated with lower rates of survival after cardiac 
      arrests in periprocedural areas, there was no association with survival for cardiac 
      arrests in the operating room.

AB  - Automatic computer-based seizure detection and warning devices are important for 
      objective seizure documentation, for SUDEP prevention, to avoid seizure related 
      injuries and social embarrassments as a consequence of seizures, and to develop on 
      demand epilepsy therapies. Automatic seizure detection systems can be based on 
      direct analysis of epileptiform discharges on scalp-EEG or intracranial EEG, on the 
      detection of motor manifestations of epileptic seizures using surface 
      electromyography (sEMG), accelerometry (ACM), video detection systems and mattress 
      sensors and finally on the assessment of changes of physiologic parameters 
      accompanying epileptic seizures measured by electrocardiography (ECG), respiratory 
      monitors, pulse oximetry, surface temperature sensors, and electrodermal activity. 
      Here we review automatic seizure detection based on scalp-EEG, ECG, and sEMG. 
      Different seizure types affect preferentially different measurement parameters. 
      While EEG changes accompany all types of seizures, sEMG and ACM are suitable mainly 
      for detection of seizures with major motor manifestations. Therefore, seizure 
      detection can be optimized by multimodal systems combining several measurement 
      parameters. While most systems provide sensitivities over 70%, specificity expressed 
      as false alarm rates still needs to be improved. Patients' acceptance and comfort of 
      a specific device are of critical importance for its long-term application in a 
      meaningful clinical way.

TI  - Non-invasive prediction of catheter ablation outcome in persistent atrial 
      fibrillation by exploiting the spatial diversity of surface ECG.
PG  - 5531-4
LID - 10.1109/IEMBS.2011.6091411 [doi]
AB  - Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia encountered in 
      clinical practice. Radiofrequency catheter ablation (CA) is becoming one of the most 
      widely employed therapies. Yet selection of patients who will benefit from this 
      treatment remains a challenging task. Previous works have examined several 
      electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters as potential predictors of CA success, such as 
      fibrillatory wave (f-wave) amplitude. However, they require a manual computation and 
      consider only a subset of electrodes, so inter-lead spatial variability of the 
      12-lead ECG is not fully exploited. The present study puts forward an automatic 
      procedure for f-wave amplitude computation to non-invasively predict CA outcome. An 
      extension of this quantitative measure to the whole set of leads is also proposed, 
      based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA). We show that exploiting the spatial 
      diversity present in the surface ECG not only improves the robustness to electrode 
      selection but also increases the predictive power of the amplitude parameter.

AB  - Electrocardiogram (ECG) detection is a routine and effective cardiac problem 
      detection project. Traditional electrocardiogram detection has limitations in 
      cardiac arrhythmia and other heart disease detection and diagnosis, such as 
      effectiveness, real-time and so on. Based on the advanced mobile networking and 
      wearable design concept, this paper designs and implements a dynamic ECG real-time 
      monitoring system with low power embedded system and Bluetooth 4.0 wireless 
      communication. Its main functions include 24-hour dynamic ECG signal real-time 
      acquisition, processing, wireless communication, display and storage, real-time 
      analysis of typical arrhythmia, recording and alarm, professional doctors real-time 
      reading and diagnosis, dynamic ECG sharing and cloud platform automatic analysis and 
      diagnosis. Both the physiological signal generator and the actual patient's wear 
      test showed that the design and function of the wearable dynamic ECG real-time 
      monitoring terminal based on the mobile networking could meet and apply to the 
      patients with cardiac monitoring needs in the house, hospital, nursing home, outdoor 
      and many other places.

TI  - Automatic Detection of Aortic Valve Opening Using Seismocardiography in Healthy 
      Individuals.
PG  - 1032-1040
LID - 10.1109/JBHI.2018.2829608 [doi]
AB  - Accurate detection of fiducial points in a seismocardiogram (SCG) is a challenging 
      research problem for its clinical application. In this paper, an automated method 
      for detecting aortic valve opening (AO) instants using the dorso-ventral component 
      of the SCG signal is proposed. This method does not require electrocardiogram (ECG) 
      as a reference signal. After preprocessing the SCG, multiscale wavelet decomposition 
      is carried out to get signal components in different wavelet subbands. The subbands 
      having possible AO peaks are selected by a newly proposed 
      dominant-multiscale-kurtosis- and dominant-multiscale-central-frequency-based 
      criterion. The signal is reconstructed using selected subbands, and it is emphasized 
      using the weights derived from the proposed relative squared dominant multiscale 
      kurtosis. The Shannon energy followed by autocorrelation coefficients is computed 
      for systole envelope construction. Finally, AO peaks are detected by a 
      Gaussian-derivative-filtering-based scheme. The robustness of the proposed method is 
      tested using clean and noisy SCG signals from the combined measurement of ECG, 
      breathing, and SCG database. Evaluation results show that the method can achieve an 
      average sensitivity of 94%, a prediction rate of 90%, and a detection accuracy of 
      86% approximately over 4585 analyzed beats.

AB  - Electrocardiogram (ECG), which is a noninvasive technique, is used generally as a 
      primary diagnostic tool for cardiovascular diseases. In real-time scenario, noises 
      like channel noise, muscle artifacts, electrode motion and baseline wander are often 
      embedded with ECG signals during acquisition and transmission. In this paper, an 
      automatic ECG signal enhancement technique is proposed to remove noise components 
      from time-frequency domain represented noisy ECG signal. Stockwell transform 
      (S-Transform) is used in this work to represent the noisy ECG signal in 
      time-frequency domain. Next, masking and filtering technique is applied to remove 
      unwanted noise components from time-frequency domain. The proposed technique does 
      not require any prior information like R-peak position or reference signal as 
      auxiliary signal. This method is evaluated on ECG signals which are available in 
      MIT-BIH Arrhythmia database. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed 
      method shows better signal to noise ratio (SNR) and lower root means square error 
      (RMSE) compared to earlier reported wavelet transform with soft thresholding 
      (WT-Soft) and wavelet transform with subband dependent threshold (WT-Subband) based 
      technique. To quantify the significant difference among all methods, the 
      performances of different ECG enhancement techniques at 1.25dB input SNR level are 
      compared using analysis of variance (ANOVA) based statistical evaluation technique 
      and it is seen that the proposed method yields superior performance compared to 
      other methods. R-peak detection test is also conducted on enhanced ECG signal in 
      addition to SNR and RMSE to evaluate the quality of biology-related information 
      preserved in the enhanced ECG signal. The performance of R-peak detection for 
      denoised ECG signals, in terms of sensitivity and positive predictivity using 
      proposed enhancement method, is also better than WT-Soft, WT-Subband methods, and 
      validates the superiority of the proposed method.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The dynamics of cardiovascular variables are modulated by respiration. 
      The aim of this study was to assess baroreflex function in normal subjects based on 
      the joint symbolic dynamics of heart rate, blood pressure and respiration. METHODS: 
      ECG, continuous blood pressure and respiration were recorded in ten healthy subjects 
      during rest in the supine position and upon standing. Beat-to-beat time series of 
      heart rate, systolic blood pressure and respiratory phase were extracted and 
      transformed into binary symbol sequences. Words of length two that were reflective 
      of baroreflex activity were statistically analysed with respect to the respiratory 
      phase. RESULTS: Symbolic analysis showed a significant influence of the respiratory 
      phase on the occurrence of baroreflex patterns. Upon standing, the frequency of 
      baroreflex words increased and the effect of respiration appeared to be reduced. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Symbolic dynamics provide a simple representation of cardiovascular 
      dynamics and may be useful for assessing baroreflex function.

TI  - ECG Signal as Robust and Reliable Biometric Marker: Datasets and Algorithms 
      Comparison.
LID - 10.3390/s19102350 [doi]
LID - 2350
AB  - In this paper, the possibility of using the ECG signal as an unequivocal biometric 
      marker for authentication and identification purposes has been presented. 
      Furthermore, since the ECG signal was acquired from 4 sources using different 
      measurement equipment, electrodes positioning and number of patients as well as the 
      duration of the ECG record acquisition, we have additionally provided an estimation 
      of the extent of information available in the ECG record. To provide a more 
      objective assessment of the credibility of the identification method, some selected 
      machine learning algorithms were used in two combinations: with and without 
      compression. The results that we have obtained confirm that the ECG signal can be 
      acclaimed as a valid biometric marker that is very robust to hardware variations, 
      noise and artifacts presence, that is stable over time and that is scalable across 
      quite a solid (~100) number of users. Our experiments indicate that the most 
      promising algorithms for ECG identification are LDA, KNN and MLP algorithms. 
      Moreover, our results show that PCA compression, used as part of data preprocessing, 
      does not only bring any noticeable benefits but in some cases might even reduce 
      accuracy.

      Perceived Stress Levels-A Pilot Study on Firefighters.

AB  - Chronic stress is the main cause of health problems in high-risk jobs. Wearable 
      sensors can become an ecologically valid method of stress level assessment in 
      real-life applications. We sought to determine a non-invasive technique for 
      objective stress monitoring. Data were collected from firefighters during 24-h 
      shifts using sensor belts equipped with a dry-lead electrocardiograph (ECG) and a 
      three-axial accelerometer. Levels of stress experienced during fire incidents were 
      evaluated via a brief self-assessment questionnaire. Types of physical activity were 
      distinguished basing on accelerometer readings, and heart rate variability (HRV) 
      time series were segmented accordingly into corresponding fragments. Those segments 
      were classified as stress/no-stress conditions. Receiver Operating Characteristic 
      (ROC) analysis showed true positive classification as stress condition for 15% of 
      incidents (while maintaining almost zero False Positive Rate), which parallels the 
      amount of truly stressful incidents reported in the questionnaires. These results 
      show a firm correspondence between the perceived stress level and physiological 
      data. Psychophysiological measurements are reliable indicators of stress even in 
      ecological settings and appear promising for chronic stress monitoring in high-risk 
      jobs, such as firefighting.

AB  - The analysis and interpretation of physiological signals acquired non-invasively are 
      increasingly important in Smart Health, precision medicine, and medical research. 
      However, this analysis is hampered due to the length, complexity, and inter-subject 
      variation of these signals, and, consequently, dimensionality reduction and 
      clustering offer substantial benefits. Machine learning, used widely in biomedicine, 
      is increasingly being applied to physiological time series. Among the applications 
      of unsupervised learning, clustering is one of the most important. In this paper, an 
      unsupervised autoen-coder architecture, deep convolutional embedded clustering, is 
      presented as a data-driven approach to study time-frequency characteristics of heart 
      rate variability records. An autoen-coder network is trained on continuous wavelet 
      transforms of heart rate variability signals calculated from publicly-available 
      annotated ECG records with a wide variety of conditions. The latent variables 
      learned by the clustering autoencoder are low-dimensional representations of wavelet 
      transform characteristics that can be visualized and further analyzed. The results 
      indicate that the learned clusters correspond to beat morphologies in the 
      electrocardiogram in many cases, but also that the reduced dimensions of the 
      time-frequency features can potentially provide additional insights into cardiac 
      activity and the autonomic nervous system.

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the effect of automatic tube potential selection and automatic 
      exposure control combined with female breast displacement during coronary computed 
      tomography angiography (CCTA) on radiation exposure in women versus men of the same 
      body size. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Consecutive clinical exams between January 2012 
      and July 2013 at an academic medical center were retrospectively analyzed. All 
      examinations were performed using ECG-gating, automated tube potential, and tube 
      current selection algorithm (APS-AEC) with breast displacement in females. Cohorts 
      were stratified by sex and standard World Health Organization body mass index (BMI) 
      ranges. CT dose index volume (CTDIvol), dose length product (DLP) median effective 
      dose (ED), and size specific dose estimate (SSDE) were recorded. Univariable and 
      multivariable regression analyses were performed to evaluate the effect of gender on 
      radiation exposure per BMI. RESULTS: A total of 726 exams were included, 343 (47%) 
      were females; mean BMI was similar by gender (28.6±6.9 kg/m(2) females vs. 29.2±6.3 
      kg/m(2) males; P=0.168). Median ED was 2.3 mSv (1.4-5.2) for females and 3.6 
      (2.5-5.9) for males (P<0.001). Females were exposed to less radiation by a 
      difference in median ED of -1.3 mSv, CTDIvol -4.1 mGy, and SSDE -6.8 mGy (all 
      P<0.001). After adjusting for BMI, patient characteristics, and gating mode, females 
      exposure was lower by a median ED of -0.7 mSv, CTDIvol -2.3 mGy, and SSDE -3.15 mGy, 
      respectively (all P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: We observed a difference in radiation 
      exposure to patients undergoing CCTA with the combined use of AEC-APS and breast 
      displacement in female patients as compared to their BMI-matched male counterparts, 
      with female patients receiving one third less exposure.

AB  - We examined the effects of gender and age in young and middle-aged subjects on the 
      level of cardio-respiratory interaction by analyzing properties of cardiac, 
      respiratory and cardiac-respiratory regulatory mechanisms under paced breathing. In 
      56 healthy subjects, ECG (RR interval) and respiratory signal were simultaneously 
      acquired in supine position at paced (0.1-0.45 Hz, steps of 0.05 Hz) and spontaneous 
      breathing. The participants were divided into gender matched group of young adults 
      (19-25 years old) and middle-aged adults (35-44 years old). Power spectral analysis 
      was applied on RR interval time series and spectral components in very low frequency 
      (VLF), low frequency (LF) and high frequency (HF) ranges were computed. We also 
      calculated sample entropy of RR interval series (SampEnRR), respiratory series 
      (SampEnResp), and their cross-sample entropy (cross-SampEn). Under paced breathing, 
      reduction of all spectral powers with age (p<0.05) is not gender dependent but 
      reduction of some entropy measures is; SampEnRR and SampEnResp were lower only in 
      men (p<0.05). In the middle-aged subjects, effect of gender on spectral measures is 
      significant; males had lower HF (p < 0.05). Pattern of dependencies of SampEn and 
      cross-SampEn on paced breathing frequency were significantly different in men (young 
      vs. middle-aged, p = 0.001 and p = 0.037) and in middle-aged subjects (females vs. 
      males, p = 0.011 and p = 0.008). In middle-aged males, lower entropy measures 
      indicated reduced and less complex partial cardiac and respiratory control, and 
      central cardio-respiratory control. In conclusion, in healthy middle-aged subjects 
      changes in cardio-respiratory coupling are detectable only in males.

TI  - No evidence of chaos in the heart rate variability of normal and cardiac transplant 
      human subjects.
PG  - 1350-7
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The variability observed in the heart rate may reflect fundamental 
      aspects of cardiac activity. It has been under discussion whether heart rate 
      variability (HRV) is due to noise or chaos, which is irregular behavior occurring in 
      deterministic nonlinear systems. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using chaos analysis 
      techniques, we analyzed HRV of five normal and five human cardiac transplant 
      subjects at rest. HRV is studied using the beat-to-beat RR interval time series 
      extracted from the ECG. The cardiac transplant subjects exhibited a much smaller HRV 
      than the normal subjects because of heart denervation. We present the map and 
      correlation dimension estimation for the RR time series. To test for nonlinear 
      correlations in the dynamics, we built surrogate time series that have the same 
      power spectra as the experimental time series, but also have randomized phases. The 
      experimental and the surrogate data were compared using the correlation integral. No 
      correlation dimension was found for the RR time series of either the normal or the 
      cardiac transplant subjects. Nevertheless, nonlinear correlations were detected in 
      the HRV of the normal subjects but not in HRV of the cardiac transplant subjects. 
      For the latter, no significant changes were observed in the correlation integral as 
      a function of time after transplantation. CONCLUSION: We found no evidence of 
      low-dimensional chaos in the HRV of normal and cardiac transplant subjects. However, 
      some nonlinear correlations were detected in the HRV of the normal subjects, which 
      may be associated with autonomic nervous system influence.

TI  - Crowd-sourced annotation of ecg signals using contextual information.

AB  - For medical applications, the ground truth is ascertained through manual labels by 
      clinical experts. However, significant inter-observer variability and various human 
      biases limit accuracy. A probabilistic framework addresses these issues by comparing 
      aggregated human and automated labels to provide a reliable ground truth, with no 
      prior knowledge of the individual performance. As an alternative to median or mean 
      voting strategies, novel contextual features (signal quality and physiology) were 
      introduced to allow the Probabilistic Label Aggregator (PLA) to weight an algorithm 
      or human based on its performance. As a proof of concept, the PLA was applied to QT 
      interval (pro-arrhythmic indicator) estimation from the electrocardiogram using 
      labels from 20 humans and 48 algorithms crowd-sourced from the 2006 
      PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge database. For automatic annotations, the 
      root mean square error of the PLA was 13.97 ± 0.46 ms, significantly outperforming 
      the best Challenge entry (16.36 ms) as well as mean and median voting strategies 
      (17.67 ± 0.56 ms and 14.44 ± 0.52 ms respectively with p < 0.05). When selecting 
      three annotators, the PLA improved the annotation accuracy over median aggregation 
      by 10.7% for human annotators and 14.4% for automated algorithms. The PLA could 
      therefore provide an improved "gold standard" for medical annotation tasks even when 
      ground truth is not available.

AB  - This study investigated an electrocardiogram (ECG) eigenvalue automatic analysis and 
      detection method; ECG eigenvalues were used to reverse the myocardial action 
      potential in order to achieve automatic detection and diagnosis of heart disease. 
      Firstly, the frequency component of the feature signal was extracted based on the 
      wavelet transform, which could be used to locate the signal feature after the energy 
      integral processing. Secondly, this study established a simultaneous equations model 
      of action potentials of the myocardial membrane, using ECG eigenvalues for 
      regression fitting, in order to accurately obtain the eigenvalue vector of 
      myocardial membrane potential. The experimental results show that the accuracy of 
      ECG eigenvalue recognition is more than 99.27%, and the accuracy rate of detection 
      of heart disease such as myocardial ischemia and heart failure is more than 86.7%.

AB  - Cardiovascular toxicity is the most common cause of fatality in the first 24 hours 
      of poisoning with aluminium phosphide (AlP). Most often manifesting itself in 
      cardiac dysrhythmias. The aim of this study was to evaluate the benefits of 
      amiodarone prophylaxis against cardiac dysrhythmia in 46 patients with acute AlP 
      poisoning. They were divided in two groups of 23: one receiving amiodarone and the 
      other not (control). The treatment group received amiodarone prophylaxis in the 
      initial intravenous bolus dose of 150 mg, followed by a drip of 1 mg/min for six 
      hours and then of 0.5 mg/min for eighteen hours. Both groups were Holter-monitored 
      for 24 hours since admission. Save for amiodarone, both groups received the same 
      standard treatment. Amiodarone had a significant beneficial effect in reducing the 
      frequency of ST-segment elevation and ventricular fibrillation plus atrial 
      fibrillation (P=0.02 and P=0.01, respectively), but the groups did not differ 
      significantly in mortality (9 vs 11 patients, respectively). The mean time between 
      ICU admission and death (survival time) was significantly longer in the treatment 
      group (22 vs 10 h, respectively; P=0.03). Regardless its obvious limitations, our 
      study suggests that even though amiodarone alone did not reduce mortality, it may 
      provide enough time for antioxidant therapy to tip the balance in favour of survival 
      and we therefore advocate its prophylactic use within the first 24 h of AlP 
      poisoning.

TI  - Automatic sleep scoring: a search for an optimal combination of measures.
PG  - 25-33
LID - 10.1016/j.artmed.2011.06.004 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to find the best set of characteristics of 
      polysomnographic signals for the automatic classification of sleep stages. METHODS: 
      A selection was made from 74 measures, including linear spectral measures, 
      interdependency measures, and nonlinear measures of complexity that were computed 
      for the all-night polysomnographic recordings of 20 healthy subjects. The adopted 
      multidimensional analysis involved quadratic discriminant analysis, forward 
      selection procedure, and selection by the best subset procedure. Two situations were 
      considered: the use of four polysomnographic signals (EEG, EMG, EOG, and ECG) and 
      the use of the EEG alone. RESULTS: For the given database, the best automatic sleep 
      classifier achieved approximately an 81% agreement with the hypnograms of experts. 
      The classifier was based on the next 14 features of polysomnographic signals: the 
      ratio of powers in the beta and delta frequency range (EEG, channel C3), the fractal 
      exponent (EMG), the variance (EOG), the absolute power in the sigma 1 band (EEG, 
      C3), the relative power in the delta 2 band (EEG, O2), theta/gamma (EEG, C3), 
      theta/alpha (EEG, O1), sigma/gamma (EEG, C4), the coherence in the delta 1 band 
      (EEG, O1-O2), the entropy (EMG), the absolute theta 2 (EEG, Fp1), theta/alpha (EEG, 
      Fp1), the sigma 2 coherence (EEG, O1-C3), and the zero-crossing rate (ECG); however, 
      even with only four features, we could perform sleep scoring with a 74% accuracy, 
      which is comparable to the inter-rater agreement between two independent 
      specialists. CONCLUSIONS: We have shown that 4-14 carefully selected 
      polysomnographic features were sufficient for successful sleep scoring. The 
      efficiency of the corresponding automatic classifiers was verified and conclusively 
      demonstrated on all-night recordings from healthy adults.

AB  - Early detection of asymptomatic atrial fibrillation (AF) provides an opportunity to 
      treat patients to reduce their risk of stroke. Long-term residents of skilled 
      nursing facilities frequently have multiple risk factors for strokes due to AF and 
      may benefit from screening for AF. Patients in a skilled nursing facility 65 years 
      and older, without a history of AF and without a pacemaker or defibrillator, were 
      evaluated using a Microlife WatchBP Home A automatic blood pressure monitor that can 
      detect AF when set to a triple reading mode. Those with readings positive for AF 
      were evaluated with a standard 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) or a 30-second 
      single-channel ECG to confirm the presence of AF. A total of 101 patients were 
      screened with an average age of 78 years, and 48 (48%) were female. Nine automatic 
      blood pressure monitor readings were positive for possible AF. Of those, 7 (6.9%, 
      95% confidence intervals 3.0% to 14.2%) had AF confirmed with ECG. Only 2 (2%, 95% 
      confidence interval 0.3% to 7.7%) were false-positive readings. One-time screening 
      for AF using an automatic blood pressure monitor in a skilled nursing facility 
      resulted in a high number of patients with newly diagnosed AF.

AB  - The increasing dissemination of wearable ECG recorders (e.g. Holter, patches, and 
      strap sensors) enables the acquisition of large amounts of data during long periods 
      of time. However, the clinical value of these long-term continuous recordings is 
      hindered by the lack of automatic tools to extract clinically relevant information 
      (other than non-sinus and life-threatening rhythms) from such long-term data, 
      particularly when targeting population-based research. In this work, we propose and 
      test a new tool for analyzing beat-to-beat interval measurements and extracting 
      features from Holter ECGs. Specifically, we assess the adaptation of the QT interval 
      following sudden changes in heart rate in the primary long QT types (1 & 2). We find 
      that in long QT syndrome type 2, certain QT adaptation patterns can indicate a 
      higher risk for cardiac events.

TI  - Deep learning in the cross-time frequency domain for sleep staging from a 
      single-lead electrocardiogram.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study classifies sleep stages from a single lead electrocardiogram 
      (ECG) using beat detection, cardiorespiratory coupling in the time-frequency domain 
      and a deep convolutional neural network (CNN). APPROACH: An ECG-derived respiration 
      (EDR) signal and synchronous beat-to-beat heart rate variability (HRV) time series 
      were derived from the ECG using previously described robust algorithms. A measure of 
      cardiorespiratory coupling (CRC) was extracted by calculating the coherence and 
      cross-spectrogram of the EDR and HRV signal in 5 min windows. A CNN was then trained 
      to classify the sleep stages (wake, rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep, non-REM (NREM) 
      light sleep and NREM deep sleep) from the corresponding CRC spectrograms. A support 
      vector machine was then used to combine the output of CNN with the other features 
      derived from the ECG, including phase-rectified signal averaging (PRSA), sample 
      entropy, as well as standard spectral and temporal HRV measures. The MIT-BIH 
      Polysomnographic Database (SLPDB), the PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 
      2018 database (CinC2018) and the Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS) database, all 
      expert-annotated for sleep stages, were used to train and validate the algorithm. 
      MAIN RESULTS: Ten-fold cross validation results showed that the proposed algorithm 
      achieved an accuracy (Acc) of 75.4% and a Cohen's kappa coefficient of [Formula: see 
      text]  =  0.54 on the out of sample validation data in the classification of Wake, 
      REM, NREM light and deep sleep in SLPDB. This rose to Acc  =  81.6% and [Formula: 
      see text]  =  0.63 for the classification of Wake, REM sleep and NREM sleep and 
      Acc  =  85.1% and [Formula: see text]  =  0.68 for the classification of NREM sleep 
      versus REM/wakefulness in SLPDB. SIGNIFICANCE: The proposed ECG-based sleep stage 
      classification approach that represents the highest reported results on 
      non-electroencephalographic data and uses datasets over ten times larger than those 
      in previous studies. By using a state-of-the-art QRS detector and deep learning 
      model, the system does not require human annotation and can therefore be scaled for 
      mass analysis.

TI  - Automatic detection of arrhythmia from imbalanced ECG database using CNN model with 
      SMOTE.
PG  - 1129-1139
LID - 10.1007/s13246-019-00815-9 [doi]
AB  - Timely prediction of cardiovascular diseases with the help of a computer-aided 
      diagnosis system minimizes the mortality rate of cardiac disease patients. Cardiac 
      arrhythmia detection is one of the most challenging tasks, because the variations of 
      electrocardiogram(ECG) signal are very small, which cannot be detected by human 
      eyes. In this study, an 11-layer deep convolutional neural network model is proposed 
      for classification of the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database into five classes according to 
      the ANSI-AAMI standards. In this CNN model, we designed a complete end-to-end 
      structure of the classification method and applied without the denoising process of 
      the database. The major advantage of the new methodology proposed is that the number 
      of classifications will reduce and also the need to detect, and segment the QRS 
      complexes, obviated. This MIT-BIH database has been artificially oversampled to 
      handle the minority classes, class imbalance problem using SMOTE technique. This new 
      CNN model was trained on the augmented ECG database and tested on the real dataset. 
      The experimental results portray that the developed CNN model has better performance 
      in terms of precision, recall, F-score, and overall accuracy as compared to the work 
      mentioned in the literatures. These results also indicate that the best performance 
      accuracy of 98.30% is obtained in the 70:30 train-test data set.

TI  - HeartSaver: a mobile cardiac monitoring system for auto-detection of atrial 
      fibrillation, myocardial infarction, and atrio-ventricular block.
PG  - 211-20
LID - 10.1016/j.compbiomed.2011.02.002 [doi]
AB  - A mobile medical device, dubbed HeartSaver, is developed for real-time monitoring of 
      a patient's electrocardiogram (ECG) and automatic detection of several cardiac 
      pathologies, including atrial fibrillation, myocardial infarction and 
      atrio-ventricular block. HeartSaver is based on adroit integration of four different 
      modern technologies: electronics, wireless communication, computer, and information 
      technologies in the service of medicine. The physical device consists of four 
      modules: sensor and ECG processing unit, a microcontroller, a link between the 
      microcontroller and the cell phone, and mobile software associated with the system. 
      HeartSaver includes automated cardiac pathology detection algorithms. These 
      algorithms are simple enough to be implemented on a low-cost, limited-power 
      microcontroller but powerful enough to detect the relevant cardiac pathologies. When 
      an abnormality is detected, the microcontroller sends a signal to a cell phone. This 
      operation triggers an application software on the cell phone that sends a text 
      message transmitting information about patient's physiological condition and 
      location promptly to a physician or a guardian. HeartSaver can be used by millions 
      of cardiac patients with the potential to transform the cardiac diagnosis, care, and 
      treatment and save thousands of lives.

TI  - Twenty-four hour variation in heart rate variability indices derived from fractional 
      differintegration.
PG  - 57-63
LID - 10.1111/cpf.12126 [doi]
AB  - Assuming that RR time-series behave as a fractionally differintegrated Gaussian 
      process, García-González et al. (2003) recently proposed new indices for quantifying 
      variability and structure in RR data. One of these was the 'fractional noise 
      quantifier' (fnQ), measuring the departure of an RR time-series from a monofractal 
      structure (i.e. a measure of its multifractality). Sixty-nine participants 
      (aged = 34·5 ± 12·4 years, body mass index (BMI) = 23·9 ± 2·9 kg m(-2) , maximal 
      oxygen uptake rate (V˙O2peak ) = 42·4 ± 10·9 ml min(-1)  kg(-1) , 39 males) provided 
      continuous beat-to-beat ECG recordings for a 24-h period. Fractional 
      differintegration was used to quantify fnQ, and heart rate variability was 
      calculated in the time domain. All variables were evaluated during consecutive 1-h 
      periods and also during four 6-h blocks corresponding to morning, afternoon, evening 
      and night periods. Apart from RR, circadian trends in all variables were independent 
      of gender (P = 0·11-0·59). Apart from fnQ, all variables exhibited circadian 
      variation (0·0005<P<0·012). Although fnQ was statistically uniform during the 24-h 
      period, it showed a trend towards elevated values during evening and night. The main 
      finding of this study was that fnQ was elevated by around 10% during the evening and 
      night, although this was not statistically significant. This suggests that the 
      structure of RR time-series in healthy individuals is most strongly 'multifractal' 
      during evening and night periods. fnQ appears to be a plausible surrogate measure of 
      multifractality in RR time-series.

AB  - Defibrillation is often required to terminate a ventricular fibrillation or fast 
      ventricular tachycardia rhythm and resume a perfusing rhythm in sudden cardiac 
      arrest patients. Automated external defibrillators rely on automatic ECG analysis 
      algorithms to detect the presence of shockable rhythms before advising the rescuer 
      to deliver a shock. For a reliable rhythm analysis, chest compression must be 
      interrupted to prevent corruption of the ECG waveform due to the artifact induced by 
      the mechanical activity of compressions. However, these hands-off intervals 
      adversely affect the success of treatment. To minimize the hands-off intervals and 
      increase the chance of successful resuscitation, we developed a method which asks 
      for interrupting the compressions only if the underlying ECG rhythm cannot be 
      accurately determined during chest compressions. Using this method only a small 
      percentage of cases need compressions interruption, hence a significant reduction in 
      hands-off time is achieved. Our algorithm comprises a novel filtering technique for 
      the ECG and thoracic impedance waveforms, and an innovative method to combine 
      analysis from both filtered and unfiltered data. Requiring compression interruption 
      for only 14% of cases, our algorithm achieved a sensitivity of 92% and specificity 
      of 99%.

TI  - Contribution of Electrocardiographic Accelerated Ventricular Rhythm Alarms to Alarm 
      Fatigue.
PG  - 222-229
LID - 10.4037/ajcc2019314 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Excessive electrocardiographic alarms contribute to "alarm fatigue," 
      which can lead to patient harm. In a prior study, one-third of audible 
      electrocardiographic alarms were for accelerated ventricular rhythm (AVR), and most 
      of these alarms were false. It is uncertain whether true AVR alarms are clinically 
      relevant. OBJECTIVES: To determine from bedside electrocardiographic monitoring data 
      (1) how often true AVR alarms are acknowledged by clinicians, (2) whether such 
      alarms are actionable, and (3) whether such alarms are associated with adverse 
      outcomes ("code blue," death). METHODS: Secondary analysis using data from a study 
      conducted in an academic medical center involving 5 adult intensive care units with 
      77 beds. Electronic health records of 23 patients with 223 true alarms for AVR were 
      examined. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 62.9 years, and 61% were white 
      and male. All 223 of the true alarms were configured at the warning level (ie, 2 
      continuous beeps), and 215 (96.4%) lasted less than 30 seconds. Only 1 alarm was 
      acknowledged in the electronic health record. None of the alarms were clinically 
      actionable or led to a code blue or death. CONCLUSIONS: True AVR alarms may 
      contribute to alarm fatigue. Hospitals should reevaluate the need for close 
      monitoring of AVR and consider configuring this alarm to an inaudible message 
      setting to reduce the risk of patient harm due to alarm fatigue. Prospective studies 
      involving larger patient samples and varied monitors are warranted.

TI  - The management of acute myocardial infarction in the cardiological intensive care 
      units in Italy: the 'BLITZ 4 Qualità' campaign for performance measurement and 
      quality improvement.
PG  - 143-52
LID - 10.1177/2048872612450520 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To assess and promote compliance of Italian cardiological intensive care units 
      (CCUs) with evidence-based guidelines for the management of acute myocardial 
      infarction (MI). METHODS AND RESULTS: The process of diagnosis and treatment of MI 
      was prospectively evaluated in 163 CCUs by use of 30 indicators during two enrolment 
      phases, each followed by a feedback of both local and general performance. Overall, 
      5854 patients with ST-segment elevation MI (STEMI) and 5852 with non-ST-segment 
      elevation MI (NSTEMI) were consecutively enrolled. The target for each indicator was 
      defined as compliance with the relevant recommendations in ≥90% of suitable patients 
      and it was met for nine (30%) and 10 (33.3%) indicators in the first and second 
      phases, respectively. Regardless of target, a significant improvement in compliance 
      was observed in the second phase in 10 out of 30 indicators (33.3%). Use of 
      pre-hospital ECG, expedite delivery of reperfusion therapy, dosage of antithrombotic 
      drugs, and non-pharmacological implementation of secondary prevention were often off 
      target. Similar in-hospital mortality was observed in phases I and II, both in 
      patients with STEMI (4.0 vs. 4.2%, p=0.79) and NSTEMI (1.8 vs. 2.4%, p=0.11). 
      Overall, 30-day mortality were 5.7% for patients with STEMI and 3.4% with NSTEMI. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Performance indicators can accurately weigh the whole process of 
      diagnosis and treatment of patients with MI and monitor the improvements in the 
      quality of care. In our large population of consecutive patients, satisfactory 
      30-day outcomes were observed despite suboptimal adherence to guidelines for some 
      indicators of recognised prognostic relevance.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Currently Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) is one of the most 
      prevalent diseases, and also can lead to death, disability and economic loss in 
      patients who suffer from cardiovascular disease. Diagnostic procedures of this 
      disease by medical teams are typically invasive, although they do not satisfy the 
      required accuracy. METHODS: In this study, we have proposed a methodology for the 
      automatic diagnosis of normal and Coronary Artery Disease conditions using Heart 
      Rate Variability (HRV) signal extracted from electrocardiogram (ECG). The features 
      are extracted from HRV signal in time, frequency and nonlinear domains. The 
      Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied to reduce the dimension of the 
      extracted features in order to reduce computational complexity and to reveal the 
      hidden information underlaid in the data. Finally, Support Vector Machine (SVM) 
      classifier has been utilized to classify two classes of data using the extracted 
      distinguishing features. In this paper, parameters of the SVM have been optimized in 
      order to improve the accuracy. RESULTS: Provided reports in this paper indicate that 
      the detection of CAD class from normal class using the proposed algorithm was 
      performed with accuracy of 99.2%, sensitivity of 98.43%, and specificity of 100%. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This study has shown that methods which are based on the feature 
      extraction of the biomedical signals are an appropriate approach to predict the 
      health situation of the patients.

LID - 10.1109/EMBC.2014.6944456 [doi]
AB  - The presence of respiratory activity in the electrocardiogram (ECG), the pulse 
      oximeter's photoplethysmo-graphic and continuous arterial blood pressure signals is 
      a well-documented phenomenon. In this paper, we demonstrate that such information is 
      also present in the oscillometric signal acquired from automatic non-invasive blood 
      pressure monitors, and may be used to estimate the vital sign respiratory rate (RR). 
      We propose a novel method that combines the information from the two 
      respiratory-induced variations (frequency and amplitude) via frequency analysis to 
      both estimate RR and eliminate estimations considered to be unreliable because of 
      poor signal quality. The method was evaluated using data acquired from 40 subjects 
      containing ECG, respiration and blood pressure waveforms, the latter acquired using 
      an in-house built blood pressure device that is able to connect to a mobile phone. 
      Results demonstrated a good RR estimation accuracy of our method when compared to 
      the reference values extracted from the reference respiration waveforms (mean 
      absolute error of 2.69 breaths/min), which is comparable to existing methods in the 
      literature that extract RR from other physiological signals. The proposed method has 
      been implemented in Java on the Android device for use in an mHealth platform.

AB  - The electrocardiogram (ECG) is the main measurement parameter for effectively 
      diagnosing chronic disease and guiding cardio-fitness therapy. ECGs contaminated by 
      noise or artifacts disrupt the normal functioning of the automatic analysis 
      algorithm. The objective of this study is to evaluate a method of measuring the HCP 
      variation in motion artifacts through direct monitoring. The proposed wearable 
      sensing device has two channels. One channel is used to measure the ECG through a 
      differential amplifier. The other is for monitoring motion artifacts using the 
      modified electrode and the same differential amplifier. Noise reduction was 
      performed using adaptive filtering, based on a reference signal highly correlated 
      with it. Direct measurement of HCP variations can eliminate the need for additional 
      sensors.

AB  - Computational atrial models aid the understanding of pathological mechanisms and 
      therapeutic measures in basic research. The use of biophysical models in a clinical 
      environment requires methods to personalize the anatomy and electrophysiology (EP). 
      Strategies for the automation of model generation and for evaluation are needed. In 
      this manuscript, the current efforts of clinical atrial modeling in the euHeart 
      project are summarized within the context of recent publications in this field. 
      Model-based segmentation methods allow for the automatic generation of 
      ready-to-simulate patient-specific anatomical models. EP models can be adapted to 
      patient groups based on a-priori knowledge and to the individual without significant 
      further data acquisition. ECG and intracardiac data build the basis for excitation 
      personalization. Information from late enhancement (LE) MRI can be used to evaluate 
      the success of radio-frequency ablation (RFA) procedures and interactive virtual 
      atria pave the way for RFA planning. Atrial modeling is currently in a transition 
      from the sole use in basic research to future clinical applications. The proposed 
      methods build the framework for model-based diagnosis and therapy evaluation and 
      planning. Complex models allow to understand biophysical mechanisms and enable the 
      development of simplified models for clinical applications.

TI  - Implementation of a novel postoperative monitoring system using automated Modified 
      Early Warning Scores (MEWS) incorporating end-tidal capnography.
PG  - 1081-1092
LID - 10.1007/s10877-016-9943-4 [doi]
AB  - Modified Early Warning Scores (MEWS) provide real-time vital sign (VS) trending and 
      reduce ICU admissions in post-operative patients. These early warning calculations 
      classically incorporate oxygen saturation, heart rate, respiratory rate, systolic 
      blood pressure, and temperature but have not previously included end-tidal CO2 
      (EtCO(2)), more recently identified as an independent predictor of critical illness. 
      These systems may be subject to failure when physiologic data is incorrectly 
      measured, leading to false alarms and increased workload. This study investigates 
      whether the implementation of automated devices that utilize ongoing vital signs 
      monitoring and MEWS calculations, inclusive of a score for end-tidal CO(2) 
      (EtCO(2)), can be feasibly implemented on the general care hospital floor and 
      effectively identify derangements in a post-operative patient's condition while 
      limiting the amount of false alarms that would serve to increase provider workload. 
      From July to November 2014, post-operative patients meeting the inclusion criteria 
      (BMI > 30 kg/m(2), history of obstructive sleep apnea, or the use of 
      patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) or epidural narcotics) were monitored using 
      automated devices that record minute-by-minute VS included in classic MEWS 
      calculations as well as EtCO(2). Automated messages via pagers were sent to 
      providers for instances when the device measured elevated MEWS, abnormal EtCO(2), 
      and oxygen desaturations below 85 %. Data, including alarm and message details from 
      the first 133 patients, were recorded and analyzed. Overall, 3.3 alarms and pages 
      sounded per hour of monitoring. Device-only alarms sounded 2.7 times per hour-21 % 
      were technical alarms. The remaining device-only alarms for concerning VS sounded 
      2.0/h, 70 % for falsely recorded VS. Pages for abnormal EtCO(2) sounded 0.4/h (82 % 
      false recordings) while pages for low blood oxygen saturation sounded 0.1/h (55 % 
      false alarms). 143 times (0.1 pages/h) the devices calculated a MEWS warranting a 
      page (rise in MEWS by 2 or 5 or greater)-62 % were false scores inclusive of falsely 
      recorded VS. An abnormal EtCO(2) value resulted in or added to an elevated MEWS 
      score in 29 % of notifications, but 50 % of these included a falsely abnormal 
      EtCO(2) value. To date, no adverse events have occurred. There were no statistically 
      significant demographic, post-operative condition, or pre-existing comorbidity 
      differences between patients who had a majority of true alarms from those who had 
      mostly false-positive alarms. Although not statistically significant, the group of 
      patients in whom automated MEWS suggested greater utility included those with a 
      history of hypertension (p = 0.072) and renal disease (p = 0.084). EtCO(2) 
      monitoring was more likely to be useful in patients with a history of type 2 
      diabetes, coronary artery disease, and obstructive sleep apnea (p < 0.05). These 
      patients were also more likely to have been on a PCA post-operatively (p < 0.05). 
      Overall, non-invasive physiologic monitoring incorporating an automated MEWS system, 
      modified to include end-tidal CO2 can be feasibly implemented in a hospital ward. 
      Further study is needed to evaluate its clinical utility, including an end-tidal 
      CO(2) score, is feasibly implemented and can be useful in monitoring select 
      post-operative patients for derangements in physiologic metrics. Like any other 
      monitoring system, false alarms may occur at high rates. While further study is 
      needed to determine the additive utility of EtCO(2) in MEWS calculations, this study 
      suggests utility of EtCO(2) in select post-operative patients.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Channelopathies are associated with mutations of genes encoding 
      proteins creating or interacting with the specialized ion channels in myocardial 
      cell membranes, thus forming arrhythmogenic substrate predisposing the patient to 
      sudden cardiac death. The study focuses the clinical and ECG presentation and 
      management of children with channelopathies in Slovakia. SUBJECT AND METHODS: 
      Twenty-two children with suspected channelopathy were admitted to Children's Cardiac 
      Center Bratislava in the years 2007-2014. Genetic testing was made in 19 patients. 
      RESULTS: Fourteen patients were symptomatic. Long QT syndrome was genetically proven 
      in eight and catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia in five patients. 
      Twenty children are treated with beta-blockers, five in combination with mexiletine 
      or flecainide. Nine patients received implantable cardiac defibrillator and one 
      underwent left cardiac sympathetic denervation. CONCLUSION: Both clinical 
      presentation and genetic testing must be considered in the diagnostic and 
      therapeutic process of channelopathies. Early diagnosis allows for adequate 
      treatment and lifestyle modification.

TI  - Suppression of false arrhythmia alarms in the ICU: a machine learning approach.
PG  - 1186-203
LID - 10.1088/0967-3334/37/8/1186 [doi]
AB  - This paper presents a novel approach for false alarm suppression using machine 
      learning tools. It proposes a multi-modal detection algorithm to find the true beats 
      using the information from all the available waveforms. This method uses a variety 
      of beat detection algorithms, some of which are developed by the authors. The 
      outputs of the beat detection algorithms are combined using a machine learning 
      approach. For the ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation alarms, 
      separate classification models are trained to distinguish between the normal and 
      abnormal beats. This information, along with alarm-specific criteria, is used to 
      decide if the alarm is false. The results indicate that the presented method was 
      effective in suppressing false alarms when it was tested on a hidden validation 
      dataset.

PG  - 5203-6
LID - 10.1109/EMBC.2015.7319564 [doi]
AB  - This paper intends to bring new insights in the methods for extracting features for 
      cardiac arrhythmia detection and classification systems. We explore the possibility 
      for utilizing vectorcardiograms (VCG) along with electrocardiograms (ECG) to get 
      relevant informations from the heartbeats on the MIT-BIH database. For this purpose, 
      we apply complex networks to extract features from the VCG. We follow the ANSI/AAMI 
      EC57:1998 standard, for classifying the beats into 5 classes (N, V, S, F and Q), and 
      de Chazal's scheme for dataset division into training and test set, with 22 folds 
      validation setup for each set. We used the Support Vector Machinhe (SVM) classifier 
      and the best result we chose had a global accuracy of 84.1%, while still obtaining 
      relatively high Sensitivities and Positive Predictive Value and low False Positive 
      Rates, when compared to other papers that follows the same evaluation methodology 
      that we do.

TI  - Discrete-time backpropagation for training synaptic delay-based artificial neural 
      networks.
PG  - 779-89
LID - 10.1109/72.774220 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this paper is to endow a well-known structure for processing 
      time-dependent information, synaptic delay-based ANN's, with a reliable and easy to 
      implement algorithm suitable for training temporal decision processes. In fact, we 
      extend the backpropagation algorithm to discrete-time feedforward networks that 
      include adaptable internal time delays in the synapses. The structure of the network 
      is similar to the one presented by [1], that is, in addition to the weights modeling 
      the transmission capabilities of the synaptic connections, we model their length by 
      means of a parameter that indicates the delay a discrete-event suffers when going 
      from Zthe origin neuron to the target neuron through a synaptic connection. Like the 
      weights, these delays are also trainable, and a training algorithm can be derived 
      that is almost as simple as the backpropagation algorithm, and which is really an 
      extension of it. We present examples of the application of these networks and 
      algorithm to the prediction of time series and to the recognition of patterns in 
      electrocardiographic signals. In the first case, we employ the temporal reasoning 
      characteristics of these networks for the prediction of future values in a benchmark 
      example of a time series: the one governed by the Mackey-Glass chaotic equation. In 
      the second case, we provide a real life example. The problem consists in identifying 
      different types of beats through two levels of temporal processing, one relating the 
      morphological features which make up the beat in time and another one that relates 
      the positions of beats in time, that is, considers rhythm characteristics of the ECG 
      signal. In order to do this, the network receives the signal sequentially, no 
      windowing, segmentation, or thresholding are applied.

AB  - AIM: An automatic resuscitation rhythm annotator (ARA) would facilitate and enhance 
      retrospective analysis of resuscitation data, contributing to a better understanding 
      of the interplay between therapy and patient response. The objective of this study 
      was to define, implement, and demonstrate an ARA architecture for complete 
      resuscitation episodes, including chest compression pauses (CC-pauses) and chest 
      compression intervals (CC-intervals). METHODS: We analyzed 126.5h of ECG and 
      accelerometer-based chest-compression depth data from 281 out-of-hospital cardiac 
      arrest (OHCA) patients. Data were annotated by expert reviewers into asystole (AS), 
      pulseless electrical activity (PEA), pulse-generating rhythm (PR), ventricular 
      fibrillation (VF), and ventricular tachycardia (VT). Clinical pulse annotations were 
      based on patient-charts and impedance measurements. An ARA was developed for 
      CC-pauses, and was used in combination with a chest compression artefact removal 
      filter during CC-intervals. The performance of the ARA was assessed in terms of the 
      unweighted mean of sensitivities (UMS). RESULTS: The UMS of the ARA were 75.0% 
      during CC-pauses and 52.5% during CC-intervals, 55-points and 32.5-points over a 
      random guess (20% for five categories). Filtering increased the UMS during 
      CC-intervals by 5.2-points. Sensitivities for AS, PEA, PR, VF, and VT were 66.8%, 
      55.8%, 86.5%, 82.1% and 83.8% during CC-pauses; and 51.1%, 34.1%, 58.7%, 86.4%, and 
      32.1% during CC-intervals. CONCLUSIONS: A general ARA architecture was defined and 
      demonstrated on a comprehensive OHCA dataset. Results showed that semi-automatic 
      resuscitation rhythm annotation, which may involve further revision/correction by 
      clinicians for quality assurance, is feasible. The performance (UMS) dropped 
      significantly during CC-intervals and sensitivity was lowest for PEA.

TI  - Machine learning on-a-chip: a high-performance low-power reusable neuron 
      architecture for artificial neural networks in ECG classifications.
PG  - 751-7
LID - 10.1016/j.compbiomed.2012.04.007 [doi]
AB  - Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are a promising machine learning technique in 
      classifying non-linear electrocardiogram (ECG) signals and recognizing abnormal 
      patterns suggesting risks of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). In this paper, we 
      propose a new reusable neuron architecture (RNA) enabling a performance-efficient 
      and cost-effective silicon implementation for ANN. The RNA architecture consists of 
      a single layer of physical RNA neurons, each of which is designed to use minimal 
      hardware resource (e.g., a single 2-input multiplier-accumulator is used to compute 
      the dot product of two vectors). By carefully applying the principal of time 
      sharing, RNA can multiplexs this single layer of physical neurons to efficiently 
      execute both feed-forward and back-propagation computations of an ANN while 
      conserving the area and reducing the power dissipation of the silicon. A three-layer 
      51-30-12 ANN is implemented in RNA to perform the ECG classification for CVD 
      detection. This RNA hardware also allows on-chip automatic training update. A 
      quantitative design space exploration in area, power dissipation, and execution 
      speed between RNA and three other implementations representative of different 
      reusable hardware strategies is presented and discussed. Compared with an equivalent 
      software implementation in C executed on an embedded microprocessor, the RNA ASIC 
      achieves three orders of magnitude improvements in both the execution speed and the 
      energy efficiency.

TI  - An optical measurement method for the simultaneous assessment of respiration and 
      heart rates in preterm infants.
PG  - 121705
LID - 10.1063/1.4845635 [doi]
AB  - Many conventional medical monitoring devices, while not technically invasive, are 
      nevertheless obtrusive insofar as they require contact with the patient. This 
      obtrusiveness sometimes poses problems in daily clinical practice. The need for 
      contact with electrodes or transducers is particularly relevant in the case of 
      patients recovering in intensive care units where continuous monitoring is required, 
      in turn requiring continuous direct transducer contact for prolonged periods. Among 
      the many physiological parameters commonly acquired, the respiratory and the cardiac 
      rates of the patients are of primary importance. Typically these two parameters are 
      measured respectively using spirometry and electrocardiography (ECG), both involving 
      obtrusive measurement systems requiring contact with the patient with an air conduit 
      and electrodes. This paper presents an optical measurement method for the 
      simultaneous assessment of respiration and heart rates based on the measurement of 
      the chest wall movements, associated with inspiratory/expiratory activities of the 
      lungs and by the mechanical pumping action of the heart. The measurement method has 
      been adapted for use with preterm infants and it has been applied to 55 patients 
      recovering in a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. The method is based on the use of a 
      laser Doppler vibrometer (LDVi) pointed at the left, ventral thoracic surface of the 
      patient. LDVi-based measures of respiration and heart rate have been simultaneously 
      acquired for each patient, in parallel with the same quantities acquired using 
      conventional reference instrumentation (flow-meter and ECG) for comparison purposes. 
      Results show that for respiration rate, differences with respect to the spirometer 
      data are <3%, while for the cardiac rate they are <6% with respect to ECG data. The 
      method proposed in this paper has the advantage of requiring no contact with the 
      patient. Moreover, it supports, by means of a single instrument, the simultaneous 
      measurement of respiration and heart rates, thus reducing the burden of the number 
      of electrodes, transducers, and other instrumentation that must be applied to the 
      patient--a consideration that is particularly important in the Neonatal Intensive 
      Care Unit. In addition to the measurement of respiration rate, we also describe the 
      sensitivity of the LDVi method in detecting key respiration events (irregular 
      inspiration/expiration cycles, apneas, and hiccups) which are relevant to clinical 
      monitoring.

TI  - Predicting electrocardiogram and arterial blood pressure waveforms with different 
      Echo State Network architectures.
PG  - 544-53
AB  - Alarm fatigue caused by false alarms and alerts is an extremely important issue for 
      the medical staff in Intensive Care Units. The ability to predict electrocardiogram 
      and arterial blood pressure waveforms can potentially help the staff and hospital 
      systems better classify a patient's waveforms and subsequent alarms. This paper 
      explores the use of Echo State Networks, a specific type of neural network for 
      mining, understanding, and predicting electrocardiogram and arterial blood pressure 
      waveforms. Several network architectures are designed and evaluated. The results 
      show the utility of these echo state networks, particularly ones with larger 
      integrated reservoirs, for predicting electrocardiogram waveforms and the 
      adaptability of such models across individuals. The work presented here offers a 
      unique approach for understanding and predicting a patient's waveforms in order to 
      potentially improve alarm generation. We conclude with a brief discussion of future 
      extensions of this research.

TI  - Automatic detection of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation in patients with ischaemic 
      stroke: better than routine diagnostic workup?
PG  - 990-994
LID - 10.1111/ene.13326 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Prolonged electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring after ischaemic 
      stroke increases the diagnostic yield of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (pAF). In 
      order to facilitate the additional workload involved in ECG analysis due to 
      prolonged monitoring times, we investigated the effectiveness of pAF detection with 
      an automated software algorithm (SA) in comparison to the routine staff-based 
      analysis (RA) during standard stroke-unit care. Therefore, patients with acute 
      ischaemic stroke or transitory ischaemic attack presenting with sinus rhythmus on 
      the admission ECG and no history of atrial fibrillation were prospectively included. 
      METHODS: A 24-h Holter ECG assessment was performed using either RA based on a 
      computer-aided evaluation and subsequent review by a cardiologist or a commercially 
      available automated SA. In the case of discordant results concerning the occurrence 
      of pAF between the two methods, the data underwent an independent external rating. 
      RESULTS: Of 809 prospectively enrolled patients, 580 patients fulfilled the 
      inclusion criteria. pAF was ultimately diagnosed in 3.3% of the cohort (19 
      patients). SA and RA correctly diagnosed pAF in 17 patients resulting in a 
      comparable diagnostic effectiveness of the analysis methods (sensitivity: SA 89.5% 
      vs. RA 89.5%; specificity: SA 99.3% vs. RA 99.1%; κ, 0.686; P < 0.001; 95% 
      confidence interval, 0.525-0.847). RA revealed clinically relevant ECG abnormalities 
      in an additional seven patients. CONCLUSIONS: Although it should not completely 
      replace RA, SA-based evaluation of Holter ECG reaches a high diagnostic 
      effectiveness for the detection of pAF and can be used for a rapid and 
      resource-saving analysis of ECG data to deal with prolonged monitoring times.

TI  - Early repolarization pattern on ECG recorded before the acute coronary event does

AB  - BACKGROUND: Generally considered benign, electrocardiographic (ECG) early 
      repolarization (ER) pattern was claimed to be an indicator of increased 
      susceptibility to ventricular arrhythmias during acute ischemia. OBJECTIVE: The 
      purpose of this study was to assess in a nonselected population whether ER pattern 
      documented before ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is associated with risk 
      of hemodynamically unstable ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation 
      (VF) during acute STEMI. METHODS: For STEMI patients admitted for primary 
      percutaneous coronary intervention from 2007-2010, the latest ECGs recorded before 
      STEMI were exported in digital format. After excluding ECGs with paced rhythm and 
      QRS duration ≥120 ms, the remaining ECGs were processed using the Glasgow algorithm 
      allowing automatic ER detection. The association between ER pattern and VT/VF during 
      the first 48 hours of STEMI was tested using logistic regression. RESULTS: ECGs 
      recorded before STEMI were available for 1584 patients. Of these patients, 124 did 
      not meet inclusion criteria, leaving 1460 patients available for analysis (age 68 ± 
      12 years; 67% male). ER pattern was present in 272 patients (18.6%; ER+ group). ER+ 
      and ER- groups did not differ with regard to clinical characteristics. VT/VF during 
      the first 48 hours of STEMI occurred in 19 ER+ (7.0%) and 105 ER- patients (8.8%; P 
      = .398). ER was not associated with any VT/VF (odds ratio [OR] 0.78; 95% confidence 
      interval [CI] 0.47-1.29; P = .324); VT/VF before reperfusion (OR 0.48; 95% CI 
      0.23-1.001; P = .051); or reperfusion-related VT/VF (OR 1.28; 95% CI 0.55-3.01; P = 
      .569). CONCLUSION: In a nonselected population of STEMI patients, the ER pattern on 
      ECG recorded before the acute coronary event was not associated with VT/VF during 
      the first 48 hours of STEMI.

TI  - A novel method for detection of the transition between atrial fibrillation and sinus 
      rhythm.
PG  - 1113-9
LID - 10.1109/TBME.2010.2096506 [doi]
AB  - Automatic detection of atrial fibrillation (AF) for AF diagnosis, especially for AF 
      monitoring, is necessarily desirable for clinical therapy. In this study, we 
      proposed a novel method for detection of the transition between AF and sinus rhythm 
      based on RR intervals. First, we obtained the delta RR interval distribution 
      difference curve from the density histogram of delta RR intervals, and then detected 
      its peaks, which represented the AF events. Once an AF event was detected, four 
      successive steps were used to classify its type, and thus, determine the boundary of 
      AF: 1) histogram analysis; 2) standard deviation analysis; 3) numbering aberrant 
      rhythms recognition; and 4) Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test. A dataset of 24-h Holter 
      ECG recordings (n = 433) and two MIT-BIH databases (MIT-BIH AF database and MIT-BIH 
      normal sinus rhythm (NSR) database) were used for development and evaluation. Using 
      the receiver operating characteristic curves for determining the threshold of the 
      K-S test, we have achieved the highest performance of sensitivity and specificity 
      (SP) (96.1% and 98.1%, respectively) for the MIT-BIH AF database, compared with 
      other previously published algorithms. The SP was 97.9% for the MIT-BIH NSR 
      database.

TI  - Failure in short-term prediction of ventricular tachycardia and ventricular

LID - 10.1016/j.jelectrocard.2010.02.005 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) setting are prone to malignant 
      ventricular arrhythmias. We sought to test whether electrocardiographic (ECG) 
      markers of autonomic tone, ventricular irritability, and repolarization lability 
      could be used in short-term prediction of ventricular arrhythmias in this patient 
      population. METHODS: We studied 38 patients with sustained (>30 seconds) monomorphic 
      ventricular tachycardia, polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, or ventricular 
      fibrillation while monitored in the ICU and 30 patients without arrhythmia in the 
      ICU who served as controls. All patients had at least 12 hours of continuously 
      recorded multilead ECG before arrhythmic event. Mean heart rate and measures of 
      heart rate variability, QT variability, and ventricular ectopy were quantified in 
      1-hour epochs for the 12 hours before the arrhythmic event and in 5-minute epochs 
      for the last hour preevent (and using a random termination time point in controls). 
      RESULTS: A modest downward trend in QT variability and a rise in heart rate were 
      observed hours before polymorphic ventricular tachycardia and ventricular 
      fibrillation events, although no significant changes heralded monomorphic 
      ventricular tachycardia and no changes in any parameter predicted imminent 
      ventricular arrhythmia of any type. There were no significant differences in ECG 
      parameters between arrhythmia patients and controls. CONCLUSIONS: In ICU patients, 
      sustained ventricular arrhythmias are not preceded by change in ECG measures of 
      autonomic tone, repolarization variability, and ventricular ectopy. Short-term 
      arrhythmia prediction may be difficult or impossible in this patient population 
      based on ECG measures alone.

TI  - Mobile GPU-based implementation of automatic analysis method for long-term ECG.
PG  - 56

LID - 56
AB  - BACKGROUND: Long-term electrocardiogram (ECG) is one of the important diagnostic 
      assistant approaches in capturing intermittent cardiac arrhythmias. Combination of 
      miniaturized wearable holters and healthcare platforms enable people to have their 
      cardiac condition monitored at home. The high computational burden created by 
      concurrent processing of numerous holter data poses a serious challenge to the 
      healthcare platform. An alternative solution is to shift the analysis tasks from 
      healthcare platforms to the mobile computing devices. However, long-term ECG data 
      processing is quite time consuming due to the limited computation power of the 
      mobile central unit processor (CPU). METHODS: This paper aimed to propose a novel 
      parallel automatic ECG analysis algorithm which exploited the mobile graphics 
      processing unit (GPU) to reduce the response time for processing long-term ECG data. 
      By studying the architecture of the sequential automatic ECG analysis algorithm, we 
      parallelized the time-consuming parts and reorganized the entire pipeline in the 
      parallel algorithm to fully utilize the heterogeneous computing resources of CPU and 
      GPU. RESULTS: The experimental results showed that the average executing time of the 
      proposed algorithm on a clinical long-term ECG dataset (duration 23.0 ± 1.0 h per 
      signal) is 1.215 ± 0.140 s, which achieved an average speedup of 5.81 ± 0.39× 
      without compromising analysis accuracy, comparing with the sequential algorithm. 
      Meanwhile, the battery energy consumption of the automatic ECG analysis algorithm 
      was reduced by 64.16%. Excluding energy consumption from data loading, 79.44% of the 
      energy consumption could be saved, which alleviated the problem of limited battery 
      working hours for mobile devices. CONCLUSION: The reduction of response time and 
      battery energy consumption in ECG analysis not only bring better quality of 
      experience to holter users, but also make it possible to use mobile devices as ECG 
      terminals for healthcare professions such as physicians and health advisers, 
      enabling them to inspect patient ECG recordings onsite efficiently without the need 
      of a high-quality wide-area network environment.

      generator can also display the ECG information annotations at the same time, 
      including waveform data and diagnostic results. It could be a useful assisting tool

TI  - Ventricular structure in ARVC: going beyond volumes as a measure of risk.
PG  - 73
LID - 73
AB  - BACKGROUND: Altered right ventricular structure is an important feature of 
      Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy (ARVC), but is challenging to 
      quantify objectively. The aim of this study was to go beyond ventricular volumes and 
      diameters and to explore if the shape of the right and left ventricles could be 
      assessed and related to clinical measures. We used quantifiable computational 
      methods to automatically identify and analyse malformations in ARVC patients from 
      Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance (CMR) images. Furthermore, we investigated how 
      automatically extracted structural features were related to arrhythmic events. 
      METHODS: A retrospective cross-sectional feasibility study was performed on CMR 
      short axis cine images of 27 ARVC patients and 21 ageing asymptomatic control 
      subjects. All images were segmented at the end-diastolic (ED) and end-systolic (ES) 
      phases of the cardiac cycle to create three-dimensional (3D) bi-ventricle shape 
      models for each subject. The most common components to single- and bi-ventricular 
      shape in the ARVC population were identified and compared to those obtained from the 
      control group. The correlations were calculated between identified ARVC shapes and 
      parameters from the 2010 Task Force Criteria, in addition to clinical outcomes such 
      as ventricular arrhythmias. RESULTS: Bi-ventricle shape for the ARVC population 
      showed, as ordered by prevalence with the percent of total variance in the 
      population explained by each shape: global dilation/shrinking of both ventricles 
      (44 %), elongation/shortening at the right ventricle (RV) outflow tract (15 %), 
      tilting at the septum (10 %), shortening/lengthening of both ventricles (7 %), and 
      bulging/shortening at both the RV inflow and outflow (5 %). Bi-ventricle shapes were 
      significantly correlated to several clinical diagnostic parameters and outcomes, 
      including (but not limited to) correlations between global dilation and 
      electrocardiography (ECG) major criteria (p = 0.002), and base-to-apex lengthening 
      and history of arrhythmias (p = 0.003). Classification of ARVC vs. control using 
      shape modes yielded high sensitivity (96 %) and moderate specificity (81 %). 
      CONCLUSION: We presented for the first time an automatic method for quantifying and 
      analysing ventricular shapes in ARVC patients from CMR images. Specific ventricular 
      shape features were highly correlated with diagnostic indices in ARVC patients and 
      yielded high classification sensitivity. Ventricular shape analysis may be a novel 
      approach to classify ARVC disease, and may be used in diagnosis and in risk 
      stratification for ventricular arrhythmias.

TI  - Comparison of the heart rate variability parameters obtained from the 
      electrocardiogram and the blood pressure wave.
PG  - 195-205
AB  - Four temporal and four spectral parameters of heart rate variability were compared 
      after they were computed with two different time series generation methods: the RR 
      intervals and the numerical values of heart rate provided by the Finapres. 
      Recordings were obtained from 10 healthy subjects throughout five experimental 
      conditions: supine, standing, controlled breathing, exercise and recovery. The mean 
      and the RMS value of successive differences showed significant differences between 
      the two methods. The spectral parameters were statistically different only during 
      standing and exercise. The larger high frequency component and the lower HF/LF ratio 
      by the Finapres method, observed during exercise, can be explained by the higher 
      breathing influence on the peak-to-peak pressure intervals, in relation to RR 
      intervals. Therefore, the high frequency component within mechanic intervals could 
      possibly reflect the non-neural respiratory influence. In conclusion, values of 
      heart rate provided by the Finapres are not completely interchangeable with those 
      obtained from the ECG during the studied conditions.

TI  - A novel method for real-time atrial fibrillation detection in electrocardiograms 
      using multiple parameters.
PG  - 217-25
LID - 10.1111/anec.12111 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Automatic detection of atrial fibrillation (AF) in electrocardiograms 
      (ECGs) is beneficial for AF diagnosis, therapy, and management. In this article, a 
      novel method of AF detection is introduced. Most current methods only utilize the RR 
      interval as a critical parameter to detect AF; thus, these methods commonly confuse 
      AF with other arrhythmias. METHODS: We used the average number of f waves in a TQ 
      interval as a characteristic parameter in our robust, real-time AF detection method. 
      Three types of clinical ECG data, including ECGs from normal, AF, and non-AF 
      arrhythmia subjects, were downloaded from multiple open access databases to validate 
      the proposed method. RESULTS: The experimental results suggested that the method 
      could distinguish between AF and normal ECGs with accuracy, sensitivity, and 
      positive predictive values (PPVs) of 93.67%, 94.13%, and 98.69%, respectively. These 
      values are comparable to those of related methods. The method was also able to 
      distinguish between AF and non-AF arrhythmias and had performance indexes (accuracy 
      94.62%, sensitivity 94.13%, and PPVs 97.67%) that were considerably better than 
      those of other methods. CONCLUSIONS: Our proposed method has prospects as a 
      practical tool enabling clinical diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring of AF.

TI  - Feasibility of Quantification of Intracranial Aneurysm Pulsation with 4D CTA with 
      Manual and Computer-Aided Post-Processing.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The analysis of the pulsation of unruptured intracranial 
      aneurysms might improve the assessment of their stability and risk of rupture. 
      Pulsations can easily be concealed due to the small movements of the aneurysm wall, 
      making post-processing highly demanding. We hypothesized that the quantification of 
      aneurysm pulsation is technically feasible and can be improved by computer-aided 
      post-processing. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Images of 14 cerebral aneurysms were 
      acquired with an ECG-triggered 4D CTA. Aneurysms were post-processed manually and 
      computer-aided on a 3D model. Volume curves and random noise-curves were compared 
      with the arterial pulse wave and volume curves were compared between both 
      post-processing modalities. RESULTS: The aneurysm volume curves showed higher 
      similarity with the pulse wave than the random curves (Hausdorff-distances 0.12 vs 
      0.25, p<0.01). Both post-processing methods did not differ in intra- (r = 0.45 vs r 
      = 0.54, p>0.05) and inter-observer (r = 0.45 vs r = 0.54, p>0.05) reliability. Time 
      needed for segmentation was significantly reduced in the computer-aided group (3.9 ± 
      1.8 min vs 20.8 ± 7.8 min, p<0.01). CONCLUSION: Our results show pulsatile changes 
      in a subset of the studied aneurysms with the final prove of underlying volume 
      changes remaining unsettled. Semi-automatic post-processing significantly reduces 
      post-processing time but cannot yet replace manual segmentation.

TI  - Reference regions for beat-to-beat ECG data.
PG  - 162-8

AB  - The QT interval is regarded as an important biomarker for the assessment of 
      arrhythmia liability, and evidence of QT prolongation has led to the withdrawal and 
      relabeling of numerous compounds. Traditional methods of assessing QT prolongation 
      correct the QT interval for the length of the RR interval (which varies inversely 
      with heart-rate) in a variety of ways. These methods often disagree with each other 
      and do not take into account changes in autonomic state. Correcting the QT interval 
      for RR reduces a bivariate observation (RR, QT) to a univariate observation (QTc). 
      The development of automatic electrocardiogram (ECG) signal acquisition systems has 
      made it possible to collect continuous (so called 'beat-to-beat') ECG data. ECG data 
      collected prior to administration of a compound allow us to define a region for (RR, 
      QT) values that encompasses typical activity. Such reference regions are used in 
      clinical applications to define the 'normal' region of clinical or laboratory 
      measurements. This paper motivates the need for reference regions of (RR, QT) values 
      from beat-to-beat ECG data, and describes a way of constructing these. We introduce 
      a measure of agreement between two reference regions that points to the reliability 
      of 12-lead digital Holter data. We discuss the use of reference regions in 
      establishing baselines for ECG parameters to assist in the evaluation of cardiac 
      risk and illustrate using data from two methodological studies.

TI  - Comparison of baroreflex sensitivity estimated from ECG R-R and inter-systolic 
      intervals obtained by finger plethysmography and radial tonometry.

AB  - Spontaneous BRS estimates may considerable vary according to the technique of blood 
      pressure and heart rate assessment. To optimise and standardise BRS estimation for 
      clinical use we evaluated possible differences between spontaneous BRS indices 
      estimated from either finger plethysmography or radial tonometry. Forty-five healthy 
      volunteers underwent simultaneous recordings of electrocardiogram, finger 
      plethysmography and radial tonometry in supine position and during 60° head-up tilt. 
      BRS was computed by spectral analysis from either R-R time series and/or arterial 
      pressure pulse. Radial tonometry generated higher mean BRS estimates than finger 
      plethysmography. The difference decreased upon postural change from supine to 
      upright. In the upright position, BRS estimates based on R-R interval proved to be 
      generally lower compared to BRS indices estimated from arterial pressure pulse. The 
      ratio of low-to-high-frequency power of inter-systolic interval and systolic blood 
      pressure from tonometry was lower than that from plethysmography in supine and 
      approximated in upright position. Spectral parameters of inter-systolic interval and 
      R-R interval did not differ in supine but diverged in upright position. Changes of 
      spectral parameters were most pronounced in R-R interval. Arterial pressure pulse is 
      adequate for estimation of BRS under resting conditions but it may distort BRS 
      estimates under physical load. We, therefore, recommend using an ECG signal for BRS 
      estimation especially in non-stationary conditions.

AB  - The convergence between wearable and medical device technologies is a natural 
      progression. Miniaturization has allowed the design of small, compact monitoring 
      systems that can record physiological signals over longer periods of time. Thus, the 
      potential for these devices to expand the understanding of disease progression and 
      patients' clinical status is very high. The accuracy of these devices, however, is 
      dependent upon the computer algorithms utilized in the analysis of the large volume 
      of physiological data monitored and/or recorded by the devices. Automated 
      interpretation of the data by these new technologies, therefore, necessitates closer 
      examination by regulatory organizations. The current requirements for the validation 
      of novel Ambulatory ECG (A-ECG) annotation algorithms are based on the 
      AAMI/ANSI-EC57 and IEC60601-2-47 Standard. These standards are being updated, but 
      they rely on a very limited set of digitized ECG recordings from a couple of ECG 
      databases built in the first half of the 70's. These reference signals are obsolete. 
      We are developing a validation tool for computerized methods designed to detect and 
      monitor cardiac activities based on body-surface ECGs. We will rely on a set of 
      existing digital high-resolution 12‑lead A-ECG recordings acquired in cardiac 
      patients and healthy individuals. These ECG signals include a large and unique set 
      of electrocardiographic events. This tool is being qualified by the Center for 
      Devices and Radiological Health of the United States Food and Drug Administration 
      (FDA) as a Medical Device Development Tool (MDDT). This document provides insights 
      into the design of the M.A.D.A.E. database, its functionalities, and its ultimate 
      role in enabling the next generations of automatic interpretation of ECG signals.

TI  - Influence of nasal CPAP on cardiorespiratory control in healthy neonate.
PG  - 1370-1385
LID - 10.1152/japplphysiol.00994.2018 [doi]
AB  - The present study aimed to further unravel the effects of nasal continuous positive 
      airway pressure (nCPAP) on the cardiovascular and respiratory systems in the 
      neonatal period. Six-hour polysomnographic recordings were first performed in seven 
      healthy newborn lambs, aged 2-3 days, without and with nCPAP application at 6 
      cmH(2)O (nCPAP-6), in randomized order. The effects of nCPAP-6 on heart rate 
      variability, respiratory rate variability, and cardiorespiratory interrelations were 
      analyzed using a semiautomatic signal processing approach applied to ECG and 
      respiration recordings. Thereafter, a cardiorespiratory mathematical model was 
      adapted to the experimental conditions to gain further physiological interpretation 
      and to simulate higher nCPAP levels (8 and 10 cmH(2)O). Results from the signal 
      processing approach suggest that nCPAP-6 applied in newborns with healthy lungs: 1) 
      increases heart rate and decreases the time and frequency domain indices of heart 
      rate variability, especially those representing parasympathetic activity, while 
      increasing the complexity of the RR-interval time series; 2) prolongs the 
      respiratory cycle and expiration duration and decreases respiratory rate 
      variability; and 3) slightly impairs cardiorespiratory interrelations. Model-based 
      analysis revealed that nCPAP-6 increases the heart rate and decreases respiratory 
      sinus arrhythmia amplitude, in association with a reduced parasympathetic efferent 
      activity. These results were accentuated when simulating an increased CPAP level. 
      Overall, our results provide a further understanding of the effects of nCPAP in 
      neonates, in the absence of lung disease.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Application of nasal 
      continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) at 6 cmH(2)O, a level very frequently 
      used in newborns, alters heart and respiratory rate variability, as well as 
      cardiorespiratory interrelations in a full-term newborn model without lung disease. 
      Moreover, whereas nasal CPAP at 6 cmH(2)O decreases parasympathetic efferent 
      activity, there is no change in sympathetic efferent activity.

TI  - Patient characteristics associated with false arrhythmia alarms in intensive care.
PG  - 499-513
LID - 10.2147/TCRM.S126191 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: A high rate of false arrhythmia alarms in the intensive care unit 
      (ICU) leads to alarm fatigue, the condition of desensitization and potentially 
      inappropriate silencing of alarms due to frequent invalid and nonactionable alarms, 
      often referred to as false alarms. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to identify 
      patient characteristics, such as gender, age, body mass index, and diagnosis 
      associated with frequent false arrhythmia alarms in the ICU. METHODS: This 
      descriptive, observational study prospectively enrolled patients who were 
      consecutively admitted to one of five adult ICUs (77 beds) at an urban medical 
      center over a period of 31 days in 2013. All monitor alarms and continuous waveforms 
      were stored on a secure server. Nurse scientists with expertise in cardiac 
      monitoring used a standardized protocol to annotate six clinically important types 
      of arrhythmia alarms (asystole, pause, ventricular fibrillation, ventricular 
      tachycardia, accelerated ventricular rhythm, and ventricular bradycardia) as true or 
      false. Total monitoring time for each patient was measured, and the number of false 
      alarms per hour was calculated for these six alarm types. Medical records were 
      examined to acquire data on patient characteristics. RESULTS: A total of 461 unique 
      patients (mean age =60±17 years) were enrolled, generating a total of 2,558,760 
      alarms, including all levels of arrhythmia, parameter, and technical alarms. There 
      were 48,404 hours of patient monitoring time, and an average overall alarm rate of 
      52 alarms/hour. Investigators annotated 12,671 arrhythmia alarms; 11,345 (89.5%) 
      were determined to be false. Two hundred and fifty patients (54%) generated at least 
      one of the six annotated alarm types. Two patients generated 6,940 arrhythmia alarms 
      (55%). The number of false alarms per monitored hour for patients' annotated 
      arrhythmia alarms ranged from 0.0 to 7.7, and the duration of these false alarms per 
      hour ranged from 0.0 to 158.8 seconds. Patient characteristics were compared in 
      relation to 1) the number and 2) the duration of false arrhythmia alarms per 24-hour 
      period, using nonparametric statistics to minimize the influence of outliers. Among 
      the significant associations were the following: age ≥60 years (P=0.013; P=0.034), 
      confused mental status (P<0.001 for both comparisons), cardiovascular diagnoses 
      (P<0.001 for both comparisons), electrocardiographic (ECG) features, such as wide 
      ECG waveforms that correspond to ventricular depolarization known as QRS complex due 
      to bundle branch block (BBB) (P=0.003; P=0.004) or ventricular paced rhythm (P=0.002 
      for both comparisons), respiratory diagnoses (P=0.004 for both comparisons), and 
      support with mechanical ventilation, including those with primary diagnoses other 
      than respiratory ones (P<0.001 for both comparisons). CONCLUSION: Patients likely to 
      trigger a higher number of false arrhythmia alarms may be those with older age, 
      confusion, cardiovascular diagnoses, and ECG features that indicate BBB or 
      ventricular pacing, respiratory diagnoses, and mechanical ventilatory support. 
      Algorithm improvements could focus on better noise reduction (eg, motion artifact 
      with confused state) and distinguishing BBB and paced rhythms from ventricular 
      arrhythmias. Increasing awareness of patient conditions that apparently trigger a 
      higher rate of false arrhythmia alarms may be useful for reducing unnecessary noise 
      and improving alarm management.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Limitations of the manual scoring of polysomnograms, which include data 
      from electroencephalogram (EEG), electro-oculogram (EOG), electrocardiogram (ECG) 
      and electromyogram (EMG) channels have long been recognized. Manual staging is 
      resource intensive and time consuming, and thus considerable effort must be spent to 
      ensure inter-rater reliability. As a result, there is a great interest in techniques 
      based on signal processing and machine learning for a completely Automatic Sleep 
      Stage Classification (ASSC). METHODS: In this paper, we present a single-EEG-sensor 
      ASSC technique based on the dynamic reconfiguration of different aspects of 
      cross-frequency coupling (CFC) estimated between predefined frequency pairs over 5 s 
      epoch lengths. The proposed analytic scheme is demonstrated using the PhysioNet 
      Sleep European Data Format (EDF) Database with repeat recordings from 20 healthy 
      young adults. We validate our methodology in a second sleep dataset. RESULTS: We 
      achieved very high classification sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of 
      96.2 ± 2.2%, 94.2 ± 2.3%, and 94.4 ± 2.2% across 20 folds, respectively, and also a 
      high mean F1 score (92%, range 90-94%) when a multi-class Naive Bayes classifier was 
      applied. High classification performance has been achieved also in the second sleep 
      dataset. CONCLUSIONS: Our method outperformed the accuracy of previous studies not 
      only on different datasets but also on the same database. SIGNIFICANCE: 
      Single-sensor ASSC makes the entire methodology appropriate for longitudinal 
      monitoring using wearable EEG in real-world and laboratory-oriented environments.

TI  - Post-extrasystolic characteristics in the arterial blood pressure waveform are 
      associated with right ventricular dysfunction in intensive care patients.
PG  - 565-571
LID - 10.1007/s10877-018-0216-2 [doi]
AB  - Right ventricular dysfunction (RVD) is associated with end-organ dysfunction and 
      mortality, but has been an overlooked condition in the ICU. We hypothesized that 
      analysis of the arterial waveform in the presence of ventricular extrasystoles could 
      differentiate patients with RVD from patients with a normally functioning right 
      ventricle, because the 2nd and 3rd post-ectopic beat could reflect right ventricular 
      state (pulmonary transit time) during the preceding ectopy. We retrospectively 
      identified patients with echocardiographic evidence of moderate-to-severe RVD and 
      patients with a normal functioning right ventricle (control) from the MIMIC 
      database. We identified waveform records where ECG and arterial pressure were 
      available in combination, simultaneously with echocardiographic evaluation. 
      Ventricular extrasystoles were visually confirmed and the median systolic blood 
      pressure (SBP) of the 2nd and 3rd post-ectopic beats compared with the median SBP of 
      the ten sinus beats preceding the extrasystole. We identified 34 patients in the 
      control group and 24 patients in the RVD group with ventricular extrasystoles. The 
      mean SBP reduction at the 2nd and 3rd beat was lower in the RVD group compared with 
      the control group [- 1.7 (SD: 1.9) % vs. - 3.6 (SD: 1.9) %, p < 0.001], and this 
      characteristic differentiated RVD subjects from control subjects with an AUC of 0.76 
      (CI [0.64; 0.89]), with a specificity of 91% and sensitivity of 50%. In this 
      proof-of-concept study, we found that post-extrasystolic ABP characteristics were 
      associated with RVD.

TI  - Evaluation of bachmann bundle pacing versus right atrial pacing in prevention of 
      atrial fibrillation after coronary artery bypass surgery.
PG  - 529-35
AB  - BACKGROUND: In patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery (CABGS), 
      occurrence of atrial fibrillation (AF) is common in the postoperative period and is 
      associated with increased morbidity with longer intensive unit care (ICU) and 
      hospital stay. Prevention with antiarrhythmic drugs is of limited success and 
      associated with significant side effects. Therefore alternative approaches, such as 
      Bachmann Bundle pacing, are required. METHODS AND RESULTS: 154 consecutive patients, 
      mean age 58±8.8 years, including 134 males and 20 females, were randomized to three 
      groups; Group I : No pacing n= 54, Group II : RA pacing n= 52, Group III : Bachmann 
      Bundle pacing n= 48. All the groups were well matched with regard to age, left 
      atrial size, ejection fraction and use of beta blockers. Patients in Groups II and 
      III were continually paced at a rate of 100 beats per minute (bpm) or at 10 bpm more 
      than patients' intrinsic heart rate. All the patients were monitored for 72 hours by 
      telemetry and occurrence of AF was noted. Incidence of AF was 0% (none of 48 
      patients) in Group III as compared to 16.6% in Group I (9 of 54 patients) (p 0.003) 
      and 12.5% in Group II (5 of 52 patients) (p 0.03). There was a trend towards shorter 
      ICU stay in Group III (3.9 days) as compared to Group II (4.5 days) and Group I (4.1 
      days). Among the three groups, the reduction in mean P wave duration also was 
      greater in Bachmann bundle paced group. CONCLUSION: In patients undergoing CABGS, 
      Bachmann bundle pacing is superior to right atrial / no pacing in the post operative 
      period for preventing occurrence of AF and reducing ICU stay, commensurate with a 
      reduction in mean P wave duration on surface ECG.

TI  - Optimizing Wavelet ECG Watermarking to Maintain Measurement Performance According to 
      Industrial Standard.
LID - 10.3390/s18103401 [doi]
LID - 3401
AB  - Watermarking is currently investigated as an efficient and safe method of embedding 
      additional patient or environment-related data into the electrocardiogram. This 
      paper presents experimental work on the assessment of the loss of ECG 
      (electrocardiogram signal) diagnostic quality from the industrial standard 
      EN60601-2-25:2015 point of view. We implemented an original time-frequency 
      watermarking technique with an adaptive beat-to-beat lead-independent data container 
      design. We tested six wavelets, six coding bit depth values (including the automatic 
      noise-dependent one) and two types of watermark content to find the conditions that 
      are necessary for watermarked ECG to maintain the compliance with International 
      Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) requirements for interpretation performance. 
      Unlike other authors, we did not assess the differences of signal values, but errors 
      in ECG wave delineation results. The results of a total of 7300 original and 
      watermarked 10 s ECGs were statistically processed to reveal possible interpretation 
      quality degradation due to watermarking. Finally we found (1) the Symlet of 11-th 
      order as the best of the wavelets that were tested; (2) the important role of ECG 
      wave delineation and noise tracking procedures; (3) the high influence of the 
      watermark-to-noise similarity of amplitude and values distribution and (4) the 
      stability of the watermarking capacity for different heart rates in atrial rhythms.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained 
      cardiac arrhythmia and a growing healthcare burden worldwide. It is often 
      asymptomatic and may appear as episodes of very short duration; hence, the 
      development of methods for its automatic detection is a challenging requirement to 
      achieve early diagnosis and treatment strategies. The present work introduces a 
      novel method exploiting the relative wavelet energy (RWE) to automatically detect AF 
      episodes of a wide variety in length. METHODS: The proposed method analyzes the 
      atrial activity of the surface electrocardiogram (ECG), i.e., the TQ interval, thus 
      being independent on the ventricular activity. To improve its performance under 
      noisy recordings, signal averaging techniques were applied. The method's performance 
      has been tested with synthesized recordings under different AF variable conditions, 
      such as the heart rate, its variability, the atrial activity amplitude or the 
      presence of noise. Next, the method was tested with real ECG recordings. RESULTS: 
      Results proved that the RWE provided a robust automatic detection of AF under wide 
      ranges of heart rates, atrial activity amplitudes as well as noisy recordings. 
      Moreover, the method's detection delay proved to be shorter than most of previous 
      works. A trade-off between detection delay and noise robustness was reached by 
      averaging 15 TQ intervals. Under these conditions, AF was detected in less than 7 
      beats, with an accuracy higher than 90%, which is comparable to previous works. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Unlike most of previous works, which were mainly based on quantifying 
      the irregular ventricular response during AF, the proposed metric presents two major 
      advantages. First, it can perform successfully even under heart rates with no 
      variability. Second, it consists of a single metric, thus turning its clinical 
      interpretation and real-time implementation easier than previous methods requiring 
      combined indices under complex classifiers.

AB  - Monitoring the fetal cardiac activity during pregnancy is of crucial importance for 
      evaluating fetus health. However, there is a lack of automatic and reliable methods 
      for Fetal ECG (FECG) monitoring that can perform this elaboration in real-time. In 
      this paper, we present a hardware architecture, implemented on the Altera Stratix V 
      FPGA, capable of separating the FECG from the maternal ECG and to correctly identify 
      it. We evaluated our system using both synthetic and real tracks acquired from 
      patients beyond the 20th pregnancy week. This work is part of a project aiming at 
      developing a portable system for FECG continuous real-time monitoring. Its 
      characteristics of reduced power consumption, real-time processing capability and 
      reduced size make it suitable to be embedded in the overall system, that is the 
      first proposed exploiting Blind Source Separation with this technology, to the best 
      of our knowledge.

AB  - The incidence of sepsis is increasing, and the condition is now the leading cause of 
      death in general intensive care units. Our review failed to identify studies of the 
      causes of cardiac arrest among infected patients, even though non-cardiac causes 
      represent 15% of out-of-hospital cardiac arrests and though one-third of events have 
      positive blood cultures. Sudden cardiac arrest is the result of local damage to the 
      heart and of the impact of systemic and pulmonary conditions on cardiac performance, 
      and its danger is underestimated. Necropsy findings in sudden death often identify 
      myocarditis as an unexpected cause. The role of hypoxaemia, severe pulmonary 
      thromboembolism with subsequent pulseless cardiac activity, alterations of 
      electrolytes and hydrogen concentrations, distort fluid distribution with reduced 
      pre-load, direct myocyte damage and adverse cardiac effects related to antibiotic 
      use need to be defined. Many cardiac arrests might be preventable. Because 
      cardiopulmonary resuscitation is challenging and usually unsuccessful in patients 
      with sepsis, research is needed to help predict which patients are at risk. Only 
      half of pneumonia patients with cardiac arrest in the ward receive prior ECG 
      monitoring. Telemedicine and non-invasive monitoring in the ward, avoidance of 
      antibiotics associated with prolonged QT syndrome, and adequate haemodynamic 
      resuscitation might be important in preventing in-hospital arrests among patients 
      with infections.

TI  - Pulmonary artery and right ventricle assessment in pulmonary hypertension: 
      correlation between functional parameters of ECG-gated CT and right-side heart 
      catheterization.
PG  - 720-7
LID - 10.1258/ar.2012.120009 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Right ventricular function predicts outcome in patients with pulmonary 
      hypertension (PH). Therefore accurate assessment of right ventricular function is 
      essential to graduate severity, assess follow-up, and response to therapy. PURPOSE: 
      To evaluate whether PH severity could be assessed using electrocardiography-gated CT 
      (ECG-gated CT) functional parameters. A further objective was to evaluate cardiac 
      output (CO) using two ECG-gated CT methods: the reference Simpson technique and the 
      fully automatic technique generated by commercially available cardiac software. 
      MATERIAL AND METHODS: Our institutional review board approved this study; patient 
      consent was not required. Twenty-seven patients who had undergone ECG-gated CT and 
      right heart catheterization (RHC) were included. Two independent observers measured 
      pulmonary artery (PA) diameter, PA distensibility, aorta diameter, right ventricular 
      cardiac output (CT-RVCO) and right ventricular ejection fraction (CT-RVEF) with 
      automatic and Simpson techniques on ECG-gated CT. RHC-CO and mean pulmonary arterial 
      pressure (mPAP) were measured on RHC. Relationship between ECG-gated CT and RHC 
      measurements was tested with linear regression analysis. RESULTS: Inter-observer 
      agreement was good for all measurements (r > 0.7) except for CT-RVCO calculated with 
      Simpson's technique (r = 0.63). Pulmonary artery (PA) distensibility was 
      significantly correlated to mPAP (r = -0.426, P = 0.027). CT-RVEF was correlated 
      with mPAP only when issued from Simpson technique (r = -0.417, P = 0.034). CT-RVEF 
      was not significantly correlated to RHC-CO (P > 0.2). CT-RVCO measured with Simpson 
      technique (r = 0.487, P = 0.010) and automatic segmentation (r = 0.549, P = 0.005) 
      correlated equally with RHC-CO. CONCLUSION: CT-RVEF and CT-RVCO measured on 
      ECG-gated CT are significantly correlated, respectively, to mPAP and RHC-CO in this 
      population with severe reduction of the right ventricular ejection fraction and 
      could be useful for evaluating and following patients with PH.

AB  - In this paper, a MATLAB-based graphical user interface (GUI) software tool for 
      general biomedical signal processing and analysis of functional neuroimaging data is 
      introduced. Specifically, electroencephalography (EEG) and electrocardiography (ECG) 
      signals can be processed and analyzed by the developed tool, which incorporates 
      commonly used temporal and frequency analysis methods. In addition to common 
      methods, the tool also provides non-linear chaos analysis with Lyapunov exponents 
      and entropies; multivariate analysis with principal and independent component 
      analyses; and pattern classification with discriminant analysis. This tool can also 
      be utilized for training in biomedical engineering education. This easy-to-use and 
      easy-to-learn, intuitive tool is described in detail in this paper.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate the usefulness of interrupted time series analysis in 
      clinical trial design. METHODS: A safety data set of electrocardiographic (ECG) 
      information was simulated from actual data that had been collected in a Phase I 
      study. Simulated data on 18 healthy volunteers based on a study performed in a 
      contract research facility were collected based on single doses of an experimental 
      medication that may affect ECG parameters. Serial ECGs were collected before and 
      during treatment with the experimental medication. Data from 7 real subjects 
      receiving placebo were used to simulate the pretreatment phase of time series; data 
      from 18 real subjects receiving active treatment were used to simulate the treatment 
      phase of the time series. Visual inspection of data was performed, followed by tests 
      for trend, seasonality, and autocorrelation by use of SAS. RESULTS: There was no 
      evidence of trend, seasonality, or autocorrelation. In 11 of 18 simulated 
      individuals, statistically significant changes in QTc intervals were observed 
      following treatment with the experimental medication. A significant time of day and 
      treatment interaction was observed in 4 simulated patients. CONCLUSIONS: Interrupted 
      time series analysis techniques offer an additional tool for the study of clinical 
      situations in which patients must act as their own controls and where serial data 
      can be collected at evenly distributed intervals.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Some evidences have shown the role of antioxidant vitamins in preventing 
      atrial fibrillation (AF) after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. We 
      sought to determine the effect of oral vitamin C on the incidence of postoperative 
      AF in patients undergoing elective isolated on-pump CABG surgery. METHODS: 
      One-hundred patients who underwent isolated CABG surgery were prospectively assigned 
      into two groups: Group 1 - 50 patients received 2 g of oral vitamin C before and 500 
      mg twice daily lasting for 5 days after surgery; Group 2 - 50 patients as the 
      control group did not receive any. All patients were continuously monitored after 
      surgery in the intensive careunit (ICU), and then Holter monitoring was implemented 
      for 72 h. RESULTS: The mean of patients' age was 61.31 ± 6.42 years. Postoperative 
      AF occurred in 16 and 4 patients in control and treatment groups, respectively (32% 
      vs. 8%, p = 0.003). The ICU stay was 1.79 ± 0.313 and 2.10 ± 0.61 days for vitamin C 
      and control groups, respectively (p = 0.002). The hospital stay was significantly 
      lower in vitamin C group compared with that of the control group (5.32 ± 0.59 vs. 
      5.74 ± 1.30 days, respectively, p = 0.041). Baseline erythrocyte sedimentation rate 
      (OR 1.030, 95% CI 1.003-1.058, p = 0.030) and taking vitamin C (OR 8.068, 95% CI 
      1.783-36.517, p = 0.007) were the independent predictors of postoperative AF. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Oral vitamin C can be safely used to decrease the incidence of 
      postoperative AF in patients undergoing elective isolated on-pump CABG surgery.

TI  - Advanced P Wave Detection in Ecg Signals During Pathology: Evaluation in Different 
      Arrhythmia Contexts.
PG  - 19053

AB  - Reliable P wave detection is necessary for accurate and automatic electrocardiogram 
      (ECG) analysis. Currently, methods for P wave detection in physiological conditions 
      are well-described and efficient. However, methods for P wave detection during 
      pathology are not generally found in the literature, or their performance is 
      insufficient. This work introduces a novel method, based on a phasor transform, as 
      well as innovative rules that improve P wave detection during pathology. These rules 
      are based on the extraction of a heartbeats' morphological features and knowledge of 
      heart manifestation during both physiological and pathological conditions. To 
      properly evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm in pathological 
      conditions, a standard database with a sufficient number of reference P wave 
      positions is needed. However, such a database did not exist. Thus, ECG experts 
      annotated 12 chosen pathological records from the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database. These 
      annotations are publicly available via Physionet. The algorithm performance was also 
      validated using physiological records from the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia and QT databases. 
      The results for physiological signals were Se = 98.42% and PP = 99.98%, which is 
      comparable to other methods. For pathological signals, the proposed method reached 
      Se = 96.40% and PP = 85.84%, which greatly outperforms other methods. This 
      improvement represents a huge step towards fully automated analysis systems being 
      respected by ECG experts. These systems are necessary, particularly in the area of 
      long-term monitoring.

TI  - Testing procedures for non-stationarity and non-linearity in physiological signals.
PG  - 303-20
AB  - Most of the physiological signals (EEG, ECG, blood flow, human gait, etc.) 
      characterize by complex dynamics including both non-stationarities and 
      non-linearities. These time series resemble red noise with long-range correlation 
      and 1/(f beta) power spectrum. A question arises as to how to distinguish the 
      characteristics of the process underlying the signal dynamics from the properties of 
      the observed time series. The classical methods to determine possible non-linear 
      (chaotic) dynamics (e.g. correlation dimension) often fail in such signals because 
      of relatively short data records containing stochastic components and 
      non-stationarities. We report an application of several approaches, aimed at (1) 
      determining of the non-stationarities in the signals and (2) testing whether 
      non-linear dynamics exists. Assessment of the intrinsic correlation properties of 
      the dynamic process and distinguishing the same from external trends was performed 
      using singular spectra and detrended fluctuation analysis. The existence of 
      non-linear dynamics was tested by correlation dimension (modified algorithm of 
      re-embedding) and by correlation integrals of real and surrogate data. The 
      correlation integrals of real signal and surrogate data sets were statistically 
      compared using Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test. The procedures were tested on EEG and 
      laser-Doppler (LD) blood flow. Our suggestion is that no one approach taken alone is 
      the best for our aims. Instead, a battery of methods should be used.

TI  - Dofetilide-Induced Microvolt T-Wave Alternans.
PG  - 95-98
LID - 10.1109/EMBC.2019.8857486 [doi]
AB  - Dofetilide is an antiarrhythmic drug that selectively inhibits the rapid component 
      of the delayed rectifier potassium current. The administration of dofetilide may 
      cause ventricular arrhythmias and torsade de pointes. Electrocardiographic (ECG) 
      microvolt T-wave alternans (TWA), an electrophysiologic phenomenon consisting in the 
      beat-to-beat alternation of the T-wave amplitude requiring computerized algorithms 
      to be detected, has also been associated to malignant ventricular arrhythmias. Aim 
      of the present study was to evaluate if dofetilide induces TWA during the 24 hours 
      following administration. The study population consisted of 22 healthy subjects 
      ("ECG Effects of Ranolazine, Dofetilide, Verapamil, and Quinidine in Healthy 
      Subjects" database by Physionet) to whom a 500 μg-dose of dofetilide was 
      administered. For each subject, 10 s ECG were acquired at baseline (0.5 hour before 
      dofetilide administration) and at 15 time points during the 24 hours following the 
      drug administration. ECG were then processed for automatic TWA detection by 
      correlation method. In 21 subjects out of 22, after dofetilide administration, TWA 
      significantly increased to a peak value (median TWA values went from 6 μV at 
      baseline to a max 32 μV; p<; 0.05), on average after 5 hours, to then come back to 
      values closer to baseline. Thus, in healthy subjects, dofetilide increases 
      occurrence and levels (6 times baseline value on average) of TWA in the hours 
      following its administration.

TI  - Reproducibility of Heart Rate Variability Characteristics Measured on Random 
      10-second ECG using Joint Symbolic Dynamics.
PG  - 289-292
LID - 10.23919/CIC.2016.7868736 [doi]
AB  - In this paper we employed joint symbolic dynamics (JSD) approach to study 
      reproducibility of heart rate variability characteristics measured on 2 randomly 
      selected 10-second segments within 3-minute resting orthogonal ECG in 170 healthy 
      participants. First, the ECG R-peaks were detected using parabolic fitting. Second, 
      the respiratory signal was derived from orthogonal ECG X-lead using QRS slopes. 
      Third, time series of R-R intervals and respiratory phases (calculated using Hilbert 
      transform), were transformed into tertiary symbol vectors based on their successive 
      changes and words of length '3' were formed. Bland-Altman analysis was used to 
      assess the agreement between measured log-transformed JSD characteristics of HRV, 
      and their reproducibility. Traditional HRV measures such as RR' interval changes 
      showed a very high reproducibility. However, agreement between two 10-second JSD 
      indices of HRV was low. Interestingly, a significant decrease in low-high 
      alterations of HRV dynamics measured using JSD was observed when respiratory phase 
      transition intervals were excluded (10s: 4.7±9.4 vs. 24.8±21.0%, p<0.0001; 3min: 
      9.8±8.1 vs. 24.8±12.3%, p<0.0001).

TI  - Utilization of a combined EEG/NIRS system to predict driver drowsiness.
PG  - 43933
LID - 10.1038/srep43933 [doi]
LID - 43933
AB  - The large number of automobile accidents due to driver drowsiness is a critical 
      concern of many countries. To solve this problem, numerous methods of countermeasure 
      have been proposed. However, the results were unsatisfactory due to inadequate 
      accuracy of drowsiness detection. In this study, we introduce a new approach, a 
      combination of EEG and NIRS, to detect driver drowsiness. EEG, EOG, ECG and NIRS 
      signals have been measured during a simulated driving task, in which subjects 
      underwent both awake and drowsy states. The blinking rate, eye closure, heart rate, 
      alpha and beta band power were used to identify subject's condition. Statistical 
      tests were performed on EEG and NIRS signals to find the most informative 
      parameters. Fisher's linear discriminant analysis method was employed to classify 
      awake and drowsy states. Time series analysis was used to predict drowsiness. The 
      oxy-hemoglobin concentration change and the beta band power in the frontal lobe were 
      found to differ the most between the two states. In addition, these two parameters 
      correspond well to an awake to drowsy state transition. A sharp increase of the 
      oxy-hemoglobin concentration change, together with a dramatic decrease of the beta 
      band power, happened several seconds before the first eye closure.

TI  - Obstructive sleep apnea detection using spectrum and bispectrum analysis of 
      single-lead ECG signal.
PG  - 1963-1980
AB  - A novel method for the automatic diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) from an 
      electrocardiogram (ECG) is presented. This method aims to detect OSA utilizing 
      exclusively ECG recordings during sleep and present a minute-by-minute signal 
      processing technique. In the proposed algorithm, a wide range of features based on 
      heart rate variability (HRV) and ECG-derived respiratory (EDR) signals are 
      considered. The novelty of this study arises from employing bispectral analysis to 
      the HRV and EDR signals in order to illustrate quadratic phase-coupling that can be 
      observed among signal components with different frequencies. From this perspective, 
      in the proposed algorithm, a new feature set based on a higher order spectrum of HRV 
      and EDR signals is introduced and it is utilized to extract information regarding 
      their non-linearity and non-Gaussianity. This feature vector is then fed into the 
      input of a least-square support vector machine classifier. To implement the proposed 
      method, the apnea-ECG database, which contains 70 nocturnal ECG records gathered 
      from volunteer men and women, is used in this work. Results obtained from 
      cross-validating 35 data records show that the normal recordings could be separated 
      from the apneic recordings with an accuracy of 95.57% and a sensitivity and 
      specificity of 98.64% and 92.51%, respectively. In addition, 35 other records were 
      used for a pure independent validation of the proposed method and the obtained 
      accuracy, sensitivity and specificity was 94.12%, 93.46% and 94.79% respectively in 
      OSA episode detection. The performance of our proposed technique is better than in 
      other existing approaches. It can be used as a reliable tool for automatic OSA 
      identification and as a result, it will improve medical services.

AB  - More than 70% of intensive care unit (ICU) patients experience heart rhythm 
      disturbances, and these patients have correspondingly higher mortality rates. 
      Consequently, one of the standards of care in ICUs is continuous electrocardiography 
      monitoring. One of the potentially preventable dysrhythmic events is the occurrence 
      of torsade de pointes ventricular tachycardia in the setting of acquired prolonged 
      QT interval. This type of ventricular tachycardia can be malignant because it often 
      progresses to ventricular fibrillation. Many factors predispose to lengthening of 
      the QT interval, the most important of which are electrolyte abnormalities and the 
      administration of specific medications. In this review, we discuss the 
      pathophysiology of acquired long QT interval, stressing the medication-induced 
      acquired long QT-interval and factors present in ICU patients that promote 
      prolongation of the QT interval. We also propose guidelines to avoid the occurrence 
      of torsade de pointes ventricular tachycardia.

AB  - Automatic detection of the QRS complexes/R-peaks in an electrocardiogram (ECG) 
      signal is the most important step preceding any kind of ECG processing and analysis. 
      The performance of these systems heavily relies on the accuracy of the QRS detector. 
      The objective of present work is to drive a new robust method based on stationary 
      wavelet transform (SWT) for R-peaks detection. The decimation of the coefficients at 
      each level of the transformation algorithm is omitted, more samples in the 
      coefficient sequences are available and hence a better outlier detection can be 
      performed. Using the information of local maxima, minima and zero crossings of the 
      fourth SWT coefficient detail, the proposed algorithm identifies the significant 
      points for detection and delineation of the QRS complexes, as well as detection and 
      identification of the QRS individual waves peaks of the pre-processed ECG signal. 
      Various experimental results show that the proposed algorithm exhibits reliable QRS 
      detection as well as accurate ECG delineation, achieving excellent performance on 
      different databases, on the MIT-BIH database (Se=99.84%, P=99.88%), on the QT 
      Database (Se=99.94%, P=99.89%) and on MIT-BIH Noise Stress Test Database, 
      (Se=95.30%, P=93.98%). Reliability and accuracy are close to the highest among the 
      ones obtained in other studies. Experiments results being satisfactory, the SWT may 
      represent a novel QRS detection tool, for a robust ECG signal analysis.

TI  - Effectiveness of a clinical decision support system for reducing the risk of QT 
      interval prolongation in hospitalized patients.
PG  - 381-90
LID - 10.1161/CIRCOUTCOMES.113.000651 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We evaluated the effectiveness of a computer clinical decision support 
      system (CDSS) for reducing the risk of QT interval prolongation in hospitalized 
      patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: We evaluated 2400 patients admitted to cardiac care 
      units at an urban academic medical center. A CDSS incorporating a validated risk 
      score for QTc prolongation was developed and implemented using information extracted 
      from patients' electronic medical records. When a drug associated with torsades de 
      pointes was prescribed to a patient at moderate or high risk for QTc interval 
      prolongation, a computer alert appeared on the screen to the pharmacist entering the 
      order, who could then consult the prescriber on alternative therapies and implement 
      more intensive monitoring. QTc interval prolongation was defined as QTc interval 
      >500 ms or increase in QTc of ≥60 ms from baseline; for patients who presented with 
      QTc >500 ms, QTc prolongation was defined solely as increase in QTc ≥60 ms from 
      baseline. End points were assessed before (n=1200) and after (n=1200) implementation 
      of the CDSS. CDSS implementation was independently associated with a reduced risk of 
      QTc prolongation (adjusted odds ratio, 0.65; 95% confidence interval, 0.56-0.89; 
      P<0.0001). Furthermore, CDSS implementation reduced the prescribing of noncardiac 
      medications known to cause torsades de pointes, including fluoroquinolones and 
      intravenous haloperidol (adjusted odds ratio, 0.79; 95% confidence interval, 
      0.63-0.91; P=0.03). CONCLUSIONS: A computer CDSS incorporating a validated risk 
      score for QTc prolongation influences the prescribing of QT-prolonging drugs and 
      reduces the risk of QTc interval prolongation in hospitalized patients with torsades 
      de pointes risk factors.

TI  - An Automatic Subject-Adaptable Heartbeat Classifier Based on Multiview Learning.
PG  - 1485-1492
LID - 10.1109/JBHI.2015.2468224 [doi]
AB  - In this paper, a novel subject-adaptable heartbeat classification model is 
      presented, in order to address the significant interperson variations in ECG 
      signals. A multiview learning approach is proposed to automate subject adaptation 
      using a small amount of unlabeled personal data, without requiring manual labeling. 
      The designed subject-customized models consist of two models, namely, general 
      classification model and specific classification model. The general model is trained 
      using similar subjects out of a population dataset, where a pattern matching based 
      algorithm is developed to select the subjects that are "similar" to the particular 
      test subject for model training. In contrast, the specific model is trained mainly 
      on a small amount of high-confidence personal dataset, resulting from 
      multiview-based learning. The learned general model represents the population 
      knowledge, providing an interperson perspective for classification, while the 
      specific model corresponds to the specific knowledge of the subject, offering an 
      intraperson perspective for classification. The two models supplement each other and 
      are combined to achieve improved personalized ECG analysis. The proposed methods 
      have been validated on the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database, yielding an average 
      classification accuracy of 99.4% for ventricular ectopic beat class and 98.3% for 
      supraventricular ectopic beat class, which corresponds to a significant improvement 
      over other published results.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The most common acquired cause of Long QT syndrome (LQTS) is drug 
      induced QT interval prolongation. It is an electrophysiological entity, which is 
      characterized by an extended duration of the ventricular repolarization. Reflected 
      as a prolonged QT interval in a surface ECG, this syndrome increases the risk for 
      polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (Torsade de Pointes) and sudden death. METHOD: 
      Bibliographic databases as MEDLINE and EMBASE, reports and drug alerts from several 
      regulatory agencies (FDA, EMEA, ANMAT) and drug safety guides (ICH S7B, ICH E14) 
      were consulted to prepare this article. The keywords used were: polymorphic 
      ventricular tachycardia, adverse drug events, prolonged QT, arrhythmias, intensive 
      care unit and Torsade de Pointes. Such research involved materials produced up to 
      December 2017. RESULTS: Because of their mechanism of action, antiarrhythmic drugs 
      such as amiodarone, sotalol, quinidine, procainamide, verapamil and diltiazem are 
      associated to the prolongation of the QTc interval. For this reason, they require 
      constant monitoring when administered. Other noncardiovascular drugs that are widely 
      used in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), such as ondansetron, macrolide and 
      fluoroquinolone antibiotics, typical and atypical antipsychotics agents such as 
      haloperidol, thioridazine, and sertindole are also frequently associated with the 
      prolongation of the QTc interval. As a consequence, critical patients should be 
      closely followed and evaluated. CONCLUSION: ICU patients are particularly prone to 
      experience a QTc interval prolongation mainly for two reasons. In the first place, 
      they are exposed to certain drugs that can prolong the repolarization phase, either 
      by their mechanism of action or through the interaction with other drugs. In the 
      second place, the risk factors for TdP are prevalent clinical conditions among 
      critically ill patients. As a consequence, the attending physician is expected to

TI  - How to avoid misinterpretation of heart rate variability power spectra?
PG  - 15-23
AB  - Spectral analysis of R-R Interval time series is increasingly used to determine 
      periodic components of heart rate variability (HRV). Particular diagnostic relevance 
      is assigned to a low-frequency (LF) component, associated with blood pressure 
      regulation, and a high-frequency (HF) component, also referred to as respiratory 
      sinus arrhythmia (RSA) in the HRV power spectra. Frequency ranges for 
      parametrisation of power spectra have been defined for either component in numerous 
      publications.Results obtained from examinations with standardised psychic load in 
      which ECG and respiratory signal are continuously recorded and adequately processed 
      have shown that the true individual frequency range of the HF component can be 
      reliably determined only by means of characteristics of respiration (respiratory 
      rate (RR), range and median value of RR, tidal depth). Respiratory rhythms are 
      interindividually extremely differentiated and of individual-specific nature. In 
      many cases LF and HF components may be totally superimposed on each other and, 
      consequently, cannot be diagnostically evaluated.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA) allows the detection of 
      obstructive coronary artery disease. However, its ability to predict the hemodynamic 
      significance of stenoses is limited. We assessed differences in plaque 
      characteristics and contrast density difference between hemodynamically significant 
      and non-significant stenoses, as defined by invasive fractional flow reserve (FFR). 
      METHODS: Lesion characteristics of 59 consecutive patients (72 lesions) in whom 
      invasive FFR was performed in at least one coronary artery with moderate to 
      high-grade stenoses in coronary CTA were evaluated by two experienced readers. 
      Coronary CTA data sets were acquired on a second-generation dual-source CT scanner 
      using retrospectively ECG-gated spiral acquisition or prospectively ECG-triggered 
      axial acquisition mode. Plaque volume and composition (non-calcified, calcified), 
      remodeling index as well as contrast density difference (defined as the percentage 
      decline in luminal CT attenuation/cross-sectional area over the lesion) were 
      assessed using a semi-automatic software tool (Autoplaq). Additionally, the 
      transluminal attenuation gradient (defined as the linear regression coefficient 
      between intraluminal CT attenuation and length from the ostium) was determined. 
      Differences in lesion characteristics between hemodynamically significant 
      (invasively measured FFR ≤0.80) and non-significant lesions (FFR >0.80) were 
      determined. RESULTS: Mean patient age was 64±11 years with 44 males (75%). 21 out of 
      72 coronary artery lesions (29%) were hemodynamically significant according to 
      invasive FFR. Mean invasive FFR was 0.66±0.12 vs. 0.91±0.05 for hemodynamically 
      significant versus non-significant lesions. Hemodynamically significant lesions 
      showed a significantly greater percentage of non-calcified plaque compared to 
      non-hemodynamically relevant lesions (51.3±15.3% vs. 43.6±16.5%, p=0.021). Contrast 
      density difference was significantly increased in hemodynamically relevant lesions 
      (26.0±20.2% vs. 16.6±10.9% for non-significant lesions; p=0.013). At a threshold of 
      ≥24%, the contrast density difference predicted hemodynamically significant lesions 
      with a specificity of 75%, sensitivity of 33%, PPV of 35% and NPV of 73%. The 
      transluminal attenuation gradient showed no significant difference between 
      hemodynamically significant and non-significant lesions (-1.4±1.4HU/mm vs. 
      -1.1±1.3HU/mm, p=n.s.). CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative contrast density difference across 
      coronary lesions in coronary CTA data sets may be applied as a non-invasive tool to 
      identify hemodynamically significant stenoses.

TI  - ECG artefact identification and removal in mHealth systems for continuous patient 
      monitoring.
PG  - 171-176
AB  - Continuous patient monitoring systems acquire enormous amounts of data that is 
      either manually analysed by doctors or automatically processed using intelligent 
      algorithms. Sections of data acquired over long period of time can be corrupted with 
      artefacts due to patient movement, sensor placement and interference from other 
      sources. Owing to the large volume of data these artefacts need to be automatically 
      identified so that the analysis systems and doctors are aware of them while making 
      medical diagnosis. Three important factors are explored that must be considered and 
      quantified for the design and evaluation of automatic artefact identification 
      algorithms: signal quality, interpretation quality and computational complexity. The 
      first two are useful to determine the effectiveness of an algorithm, whereas the 
      third is particularly vital in mHealth systems where computational resources are 
      heavily constrained. A series of artefact identification and filtering algorithms 
      are then presented focusing on the electrocardiography data. These algorithms are 
      quantified using the three metrics to demonstrate how different algorithms can be 
      evaluated and compared to select the best ones for a given wireless sensor network.

TI  - Sleep stage classification with ECG and respiratory effort.
PG  - 2027-40
LID - 10.1088/0967-3334/36/10/2027 [doi]
AB  - Automatic sleep stage classification with cardiorespiratory signals has attracted 
      increasing attention. In contrast to the traditional manual scoring based on 
      polysomnography, these signals can be measured using advanced unobtrusive techniques 
      that are currently available, promising the application for personal and continuous 
      home sleep monitoring. This paper describes a methodology for classifying wake, 
      rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep, and non-REM (NREM) light and deep sleep on a 30 s 
      epoch basis. A total of 142 features were extracted from electrocardiogram and 
      thoracic respiratory effort measured with respiratory inductance plethysmography. To 
      improve the quality of these features, subject-specific Z-score normalization and 
      spline smoothing were used to reduce between-subject and within-subject variability. 
      A modified sequential forward selection feature selector procedure was applied, 
      yielding 80 features while preventing the introduction of bias in the estimation of 
      cross-validation performance. PSG data from 48 healthy adults were used to validate 
      our methods. Using a linear discriminant classifier and a ten-fold cross-validation, 
      we achieved a Cohen's kappa coefficient of 0.49 and an accuracy of 69% in the 
      classification of wake, REM, light, and deep sleep. These values increased to kappa 
      = 0.56 and accuracy = 80% when the classification problem was reduced to three 
      classes, wake, REM sleep, and NREM sleep.

LID - 10.1016/j.medin.2011.11.008 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the incidence of cardiovascular adverse events in patients 
      with sepsis in its various stages. DESIGN: A longitudinal, descriptive, 
      observational study was carried out. SETTING: Intensive care units of two university 
      hospitals in Bogotá (Colombia). PATIENTS: A number of patients consecutively 
      admitted to the adult ICU with a diagnosis of sepsis, and no evidence of previous 
      ischemic myocardial injury. INTERVENTIONS: Forty-eight hours of electrocardiographic 
      record using Holter technology. MAIN VARIABLES: Ischemia, cardiac arrhythmia, heart 
      rate variability. RESULTS: A total of 100 patients were analyzed, 62% being staged 
      as presenting septic shock. Three percent suffered ischemic events detected by 
      Holter and unnoticed through conventional monitoring. Forty-six percent suffered an 
      arrhythmic event detected by Holter, compared with only 6% as detected by 
      conventional monitoring. Mortality was 40%. All patients showed loss of heart rate 
      variability. CONCLUSION: In this study patients with sepsis showed a low incidence 
      of cardiovascular ischemic events. In contrast, arrhythmic events showed a high 
      incidence. Conventional monitoring failed to detect any of the ischemic events and 
      most arrhythmic events. In this study, cardiovascular events generated by adrenergic 
      discharge had no impact upon mortality.

AB  - Wearable intelligent ECG monitoring devices can perform automatic ECG diagnosis in 
      real time and send out alert signal together with abnormal ECG signal for doctor's 
      further analysis. This provides a means for the patient to identify their heart 
      problem as early as possible and go to doctors for medical treatment. For such 
      system the key requirements include high accuracy and low power consumption. 
      However, the existing wearable intelligent ECG monitoring schemes suffer from high 
      power consumption in both ECG diagnosis and transmission in order to achieve high 
      accuracy. In this work, we have proposed an energy-efficient wearable intelligent 
      ECG monitor scheme with two-stage end-to-end neural network and diagnosis-based 
      adaptive compression. Compared to the state-of-the-art schemes, it significantly 
      reduces the power consumption in ECG diagnosis and transmission while maintaining 
      high accuracy.

PG  - 1555-62
LID - 10.1093/europace/euv062 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) devices report percentage pacing as a 
      diagnostic but cannot determine the effectiveness of each paced beat in capturing 
      left-ventricular (LV) myocardium. Reasons for ineffective LV pacing include improper 
      timing (i.e. pseudofusion) or inadequate pacing output. Device-based determination 
      of effective LV pacing may facilitate optimization of CRT response. METHODS AND 
      RESULTS: Effective capture at the LV cathode results in a negative deflection (QS or 
      QS-r morphology) on a unipolar electrogram (EGM). Morphological features of LV 
      cathode-RV coil EGMs were analysed to develop a device-based automatic algorithm, 
      which classified each paced beat as effective or ineffective LV pacing. The 
      algorithm was validated using acute data from 28 CRT-defibrillator patients. 
      Effective LV pacing and pseudofusion was simulated by pacing at various AV delays. 
      Loss of LV capture was simulated by RV-only pacing. The algorithm always classified 
      LV or biventricular (BV) pacing with AV delays ≤60% of patient's intrinsic AV delay 
      as effective pacing. As AV delays increased, the percentage of beats classified as 
      effective LV pacing decreased. Algorithm results were compared against a 
      classification truth based on correlation coefficients between paced QRS complexes 
      and intrinsic rhythm QRS templates from three surface ECG leads. An average 
      correlation >0.9 defined a classification truth of ineffective pacing. Compared 
      against the classification truth, the algorithm correctly classified 98.2% 
      (3240/3300) effective LV pacing beats, 75.8% (561/740) of pseudofusion beats, and 
      100% (540/540) of beats with loss of LV capture. CONCLUSION: A device-based 
      algorithm for beat-by-beat monitoring of effective LV pacing is feasible.

AB  - The high temporal and intensity resolution of modern accelerometers gives the 
      opportunity of detecting even tiny body movements via motion-based sensors. In this 
      paper, we demonstrate and evaluate an approach to identify pulse waves and 
      heartbeats from acceleration data of the human wrist during sleep. Specifically, we 
      have recorded simultaneously full-night polysomnography and 3d wrist actigraphy data 
      of 363 subjects during one night in a clinical sleep laboratory. The acceleration 
      data was segmented and cleaned, excluding body movements and separating episodes 
      with different sleep positions. Then, we applied a bandpass filter and a Hilbert 
      transform to uncover the pulse wave signal, which worked well for an average 
      duration of 1.7 h per subject. We found that 81 percent of the detected pulse wave 
      intervals could be correctly associated with the R peak intervals from independently 
      recorded ECGs and obtained a median Pearson cross-correlation of 0.94. While the 
      low-frequency components of both signals were practically identical, the 
      high-frequency component of the pulse wave interval time series was increased, 
      indicating a respiratory modulation of pulse transit times, probably as an 
      additional contribution to respiratory sinus arrhythmia. Our approach could be used 
      to obtain long-term nocturnal heartbeat interval time series and pulse wave signals 
      from wrist-worn accelerometers without the need of recording ECG or 
      photoplethysmography. This is particularly useful for an ambulatory monitoring of 
      high-risk cardiac patients as well as for assessing cardiac dynamics in large cohort 
      studies solely with accelerometer devices that are already used for activity 
      tracking and sleep pattern analysis.

LID - 10.1088/0967-3334/36/2/283 [doi]
AB  - The Poincaré plot emerges as an effective tool for assessing cardiovascular 
      autonomic regulation. It displays nonlinear characteristics of heart rate 
      variability (HRV) from electrocardiographic (ECG) recordings and gives a global view 
      of the long range of ECG signals. In the telemedicine or computer-aided diagnosis 
      system, it would offer significant auxiliary information for diagnosis if the 
      patterns of the Poincaré plots can be automatically classified. Therefore, we 
      developed an automatic classification system to distinguish five geometric patterns 
      of the Poincaré plots from four types of cardiac arrhythmias. The statistics 
      features are designed on measurements and an ensemble classifier of three types of 
      neural networks is proposed. Aiming at the difficulty to set a proper threshold for 
      classifying the multiple categories, the threshold selection strategy is analyzed. 
      24 h ECG monitoring recordings from 674 patients, which have four types of cardiac 
      arrhythmias, are adopted for recognition. For comparison, Support Vector Machine 
      (SVM) classifiers with linear and Gaussian kernels are also applied. The experiment 
      results demonstrate the effectiveness of the extracted features and the better 
      performance of the designed classifier. Our study can be applied to diagnose the 
      corresponding sinus rhythm and arrhythmia substrates disease automatically in the 
      telemedicine and computer-aided diagnosis system.

AB  - Sleep apnea (SA) is the most common respiratory sleep disorder, leading to some 
      serious neurological and cardiovascular diseases if left untreated. The diagnosis of 
      SA is traditionally made using Polysomnography (PSG). However, this method requires 
      many electrodes and wires, as well as an expert to monitor the test. Several 
      researchers have proposed instead using a single channel signal for SA diagnosis. 
      Among these options, the ECG signal is one of the most physiologically relevant 
      signals of SA occurrence, and one that can be easily recorded using a wearable 
      device. However, existing ECG signal-based methods mainly use features (i.e. 
      frequency domain, time domain, and other nonlinear features) acquired from ECG and 
      its derived signals in order to construct the model. This requires researchers to 
      have rich experience in ECG, which is not common. A convolutional neural network 
      (CNN) is a kind of deep neural network that can automatically learn effective 
      feature representation from training data and has been successfully applied in many 
      fields. Meanwhile, most studies have not considered the impact of adjacent segments 
      on SA detection. Therefore, in this study, we propose a modified LeNet-5 
      convolutional neural network with adjacent segments for SA detection. Our 
      experimental results show that our proposed method is useful for SA detection, and 
      achieves better or comparable results when compared with traditional machine 
      learning methods.

TI  - Automatic Coronary Calcium Scoring in Non-Contrast-Enhanced ECG-Triggered Cardiac CT 
      With Ambiguity Detection.
PG  - 1867-78
LID - 10.1109/TMI.2015.2412651 [doi]
AB  - The amount of coronary artery calcification (CAC) is a strong and independent 
      predictor of cardiovascular events. We present a system that automatically 
      quantifies total patient and per coronary artery CAC in non-contrast-enhanced, 
      ECG-triggered cardiac CT. The system identifies candidate calcifications that cannot 
      be automatically labeled with high certainty and optionally presents these to an 
      expert for review. Candidates were extracted by intensity-based thresholding and 
      described by location features derived from estimated coronary artery positions, as 
      well as size, shape and intensity features. Next, a two-class classifier 
      distinguished between coronary calcifications and negatives or a multiclass 
      classifier labeled CAC per coronary artery. Candidates that could not be labeled 
      with high certainty were identified by entropy-based ambiguity detection and 
      presented to an expert for review and possible relabeling. The system was evaluated 
      with 530 test images. Using the two-class classifier, the intra-class correlation 
      coefficient (ICC) between reference and automatically determined total patient CAC 
      volume was 0.95. Using the multiclass classifier, the ICC between reference and 
      automatically determined per artery CAC volume was 0.98 (LAD), 0.69 (LCX), and 0.95 
      (RCA). In 49% of CTs, no ambiguous candidates were identified, while review of the 
      remaining CTs increased the ICC for total patient CAC volume to 1.00, and per artery 
      CAC volume to 1.00 (LAD), 0.95 (LCX), and 0.99 (RCA). In conclusion, CAC can be 
      automatically identified in non-contrast-enhanced ECG-triggered cardiac CT. 
      Ambiguity detection with expert review may enable the application of automatic CAC 
      scoring in the clinic with a performance comparable to that of a human expert.

AB  - Analysis of heart rate variability (HRV) by nonlinear approaches has been gaining 
      interest due to their ability to extract additional information from heart rate (HR) 
      dynamics that are not detectable by traditional approaches. Nevertheless, the 
      physiological interpretation of nonlinear approaches remains unclear. Therefore, we 
      propose long-term (60 min) protocols involving selective blockade of cardiac 
      autonomic receptors to investigate the contribution of sympathetic and 
      parasympathetic function upon nonlinear dynamics of HRV. Conscious male Wistar rats 
      had their electrocardiogram (ECG) recorded under three distinct conditions: basal, 
      selective (atenolol or atropine), or combined (atenolol plus atropine) 
      pharmacological blockade of autonomic muscarinic or β(1)-adrenergic receptors. Time 
      series of RR interval were assessed by multiscale entropy (MSE) and detrended 
      fluctuation analysis (DFA). Entropy over short (1 to 5, MSE(1-5)) and long (6 to 30, 
      MSE(6-30)) time scales was computed, as well as DFA scaling exponents at short 
      (α(short), 5 ≤ n ≤ 15), mid (α(mid), 30 ≤ n ≤ 200), and long (α(long), 200 ≤ n ≤ 
      1,700) window sizes. The results show that MSE(1-5) is reduced under atropine 
      blockade and MSE(6-30) is reduced under atropine, atenolol, or combined blockade. In 
      addition, while atropine expressed its maximal effect at scale six, the effect of 
      atenolol on MSE increased with scale. For DFA, α(short) decreased during atenolol 
      blockade, while the α(mid) increased under atropine blockade. Double blockade 
      decreased α(short) and increased α(long) Results with surrogate data show that the 
      dynamics during combined blockade is not random. In summary, sympathetic and vagal 
      control differently affect entropy (MSE) and fractal properties (DFA) of HRV. These 
      findings are important to guide future studies.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Although multiscale 
      entropy (MSE) and detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) are recognizably useful 
      prognostic/diagnostic methods, their physiological interpretation remains unclear. 
      The present study clarifies the effect of the cardiac autonomic control on MSE and 
      DFA, assessed during long periods (1 h). These findings are important to help the 
      interpretation of future studies.

AB  - We aimed at reducing alarm fatigue in neonatal intensive care units by developing a 
      model using machine learning for the early prediction of critical cardiorespiratory 
      alarms. During this study in over 34,000 patient monitoring hours in 55 infants 
      278,000 advisory (yellow) and 70,000 critical (red) alarms occurred. Vital signs 
      including the heart rate, breathing rate, and oxygen saturation were obtained at a 
      sampling frequency of 1 Hz while heart rate variability was calculated by processing 
      the ECG - both were used for feature development and for predicting alarms. Yellow 
      alarms that were followed by at least one red alarm within a short post-alarm window 
      constituted the case-cohort while the remaining yellow alarms constituted the 
      control cohort. For analysis, the case and control cohorts, stratified by 
      proportion, were split into training (80%) and test sets (20%). Classifiers based on 
      decision trees were used to predict, at the moment the yellow alarm occurred, 
      whether a red alarm(s) would shortly follow. The best performing classifier used 
      data from the 2-min window before the occurrence of the yellow alarm and could 
      predict 26% of the red alarms in advance (18.4s, median), at the expense of 7% 
      additional red alarms. These results indicate that based on predictive monitoring of 
      critical alarms, nurses can be provided a longer window of opportunity for 
      preemptive clinical action. Further, such as algorithm can be safely implemented as 
      alarms that are not algorithmically predicted can still be generated upon the usual 
      breach of the threshold, as in current clinical practice.

AB  - False alarms in intensive care units represent a serious threat to patients. We 
      propose a method for detection of five live-threatening arrhythmias. It is designed 
      to work with multimodal data containing electrocardiograph and arterial blood 
      pressure or photoplethysmograph signals. The presented method is based on 
      descriptive statistics and Fourier and Hilbert transforms. It was trained using 750 
      records. The method was validated during the follow-up phase of the CinC/Physionet 
      Challenge 2015 on a hidden dataset with 500 records, achieving a sensitivity of 93% 
      (95%) and a specificity of 87% (88%) for real-time (retrospective) files. The given 
      sensitivity and specificity resulted in score of 81.62 (84.96) for real-time 
      (retrospective) records. The presented method is an improved version of the original 
      algorithm awarded the first and the second prize in CinC/Physionet Challenge 2015.

TI  - Risk prediction for myocardial infarction via generalized functional regression 
      models.
PG  - 1648-60
LID - 10.1177/0962280213495988 [doi]
AB  - In this paper, we propose a generalized functional linear regression model for a 
      binary outcome indicating the presence/absence of a cardiac disease with 
      multivariate functional data among the relevant predictors. In particular, the 
      motivating aim is the analysis of electrocardiographic traces of patients whose 
      pre-hospital electrocardiogram (ECG) has been sent to 118 Dispatch Center of Milan 
      (the Italian free-toll number for emergencies) by life support personnel of the 
      basic rescue units. The statistical analysis starts with a preprocessing of ECGs 
      treated as multivariate functional data. The signals are reconstructed from noisy 
      observations. The biological variability is then removed by a nonlinear registration 
      procedure based on landmarks. Thus, in order to perform a data-driven dimensional 
      reduction, a multivariate functional principal component analysis is carried out on 
      the variance-covariance matrix of the reconstructed and registered ECGs and their 
      first derivatives. We use the scores of the Principal Components decomposition as 
      covariates in a generalized linear model to predict the presence of the disease in a 
      new patient. Hence, a new semi-automatic diagnostic procedure is proposed to 
      estimate the risk of infarction (in the case of interest, the probability of being 
      affected by Left Bundle Brunch Block). The performance of this classification method 
      is evaluated and compared with other methods proposed in literature. Finally, the 
      robustness of the procedure is checked via leave-j-out techniques.

AB  - There are now domains where information is recorded over a period of time, leading 
      to sequences of data known as time series. In many domains, like medicine, time 
      series analysis requires to focus on certain regions of interest, known as events, 
      rather than analyzing the whole time series. In this paper, we propose a framework 
      for knowledge discovery in both one-dimensional and multidimensional time series 
      containing events. We show how our approach can be used to classify medical time 
      series by means of a process that identifies events in time series, generates time 
      series reference models of representative events and compares two time series by 
      analyzing the events they have in common. We have applied our framework on time 
      series generated in the areas of electroencephalography (EEG) and stabilometry. 
      Framework performance was evaluated in terms of classification accuracy, and the 
      results confirmed that the proposed schema has potential for classifying EEG and 
      stabilometric signals. The proposed framework is useful for discovering knowledge 
      from medical time series containing events, such as stabilometric and 
      electroencephalographic time series. These results would be equally applicable to 
      other medical domains generating iconographic time series, such as, for example, 
      electrocardiography (ECG).

AB  - Cardiovascular diseases are projected to remain the single leading cause of death 
      globally. Timely diagnosis and treatment of these diseases are crucial to prevent 
      death and dangerous complications. One of the important tools in early diagnosis of 
      arrhythmias is analysis of electrocardiograms (ECGs) obtained from ambulatory 
      long-term recordings. The design of novel patch-type ECG recorders has increased the 
      accessibility of these long-term recordings. In many applications, it is furthermore 
      an advantage for these devices that the recorded ECGs can be analyzed automatically 
      in real time. The purpose of this study was therefore to design a novel algorithm 
      for automatic heart beat detection, and embed the algorithm in the CE marked ePatch 
      heart monitor. The algorithm is based on a novel cascade of computationally 
      efficient filters, optimized adaptive thresholding, and a refined search back 
      mechanism. The design and optimization of the algorithm was performed on two 
      different databases: The MIT-BIH arrhythmia database ([Formula: see text]%, 
      [Formula: see text]) and a private ePatch training database ([Formula: see text]%, 
      [Formula: see text]%). The offline validation was conducted on the European ST-T 
      database ([Formula: see text]%, [Formula: see text]%). Finally, a double-blinded 
      validation of the embedded algorithm was conducted on a private ePatch validation 
      database ([Formula: see text]%, [Formula: see text]%). The algorithm was thus 
      validated with high clinical performance on more than 300 ECG records from 189 
      different subjects with a high number of different abnormal beat morphologies. This 
      demonstrates the strengths of the algorithm, and the potential for this embedded 
      algorithm to improve the possibilities of early diagnosis and treatment of 
      cardiovascular diseases.

AB  - The role of automatic electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis in clinical practice is 
      limited by the accuracy of existing models. Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are models 
      composed of stacked transformations that learn tasks by examples. This technology 
      has recently achieved striking success in a variety of task and there are great 
      expectations on how it might improve clinical practice. Here we present a DNN model 
      trained in a dataset with more than 2 million labeled exams analyzed by the 
      Telehealth Network of Minas Gerais and collected under the scope of the CODE 
      (Clinical Outcomes in Digital Electrocardiology) study. The DNN outperform 
      cardiology resident medical doctors in recognizing 6 types of abnormalities in 
      12-lead ECG recordings, with F1 scores above 80% and specificity over 99%. These 
      results indicate ECG analysis based on DNNs, previously studied in a single-lead 
      setup, generalizes well to 12-lead exams, taking the technology closer to the 
      standard clinical practice.

TI  - Effects of moxonidine on sympathetic nerve activity in patients with end-stage renal 
      disease.
PG  - 1920-7
LID - 10.1097/HJH.0b013e32833c2100 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is characterized by markedly increased 
      sympathetic outflow that contributes to increased cardiovascular mortality in these 
      patients. The central sympatholytic drug moxonidine (MOX) has been shown to reduce 
      muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) in initial stages of chronic kidney 
      disease; however, the effects in ESRD are not known. The aim of this study was to 
      test the hypothesis that low-dose MOX causes sustained decreases in sympathetic 
      outflow in ESRD patients. DESIGN AND METHODS: Twenty-three ESRD patients (mean age 
      46.4 +/- 16 years, 14 men, seven women, no diabetic patients) were randomized to a 
      daily treatment of 0.3 mg MOX or placebo (PLA) in addition to pre-existing 
      antihypertensive therapy. At baseline and after 1 and 6 months of treatment, heart 
      rate (HR, ECG), blood pressure (mean arterial pressure, automatic sphygmanometer), 
      calf blood flow (CBF, venous occlusion plethysmography), muscle sympathetic nerve 
      activity (MSNA) (microneurography at the peroneal nerve) were measured. Data are 
      mean +/- SEM. RESULTS: MOX acutely decreased MSNA within 2 h after oral intake (from 
      45 +/- 3.7 to 35 +/- 3.9 bursts/min, P < 0.05). This decrease was sustained over 6 
      months (MSNA 45 +/- 3.7, 35 +/- 4.6, 33 +/- 4.5 bursts/min at 0, 1 and 6 months, P < 
      0.05). PLA had no effect. Neither MOX nor PLA resulted in any significant acute or 
      long-term changes in HR, MAP or CBF. CONCLUSIONS: In ESRD patients, low-dose MOX 
      produced sustained and substantial reductions in sympathetic outflow without 
      hemodynamically compromising them. We suggest that the inhibition of central 
      sympathetic outflow may improve cardiovascular prognosis in ESRD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The manufacturer has developed a new ECG screening tool to determine 
      eligibility for the subcutaneous ICD (S-ICD), the "automatic screening tool" (AST), 
      which may render manual ECG-screening unnecessary. The aim of the study was to 
      determine the eligibility for the S-ICD using two methods (manual ECG-screening 
      versus AST) in different patient categories including patients with cardiomyopathy, 
      congenital heart disease and inherited primary arrhythmia syndrome. METHODS: We 
      prospectively evaluated the ECG suitability for an S-ICD in consecutive patients at 
      our outpatient clinic between February and June 2017. The primary endpoint of the 
      study was ECG eligibility defined as at least 1 successful vector in both supine and 
      sitting postures. RESULTS: A total of 254 patients (167 men; mean age 45 ± 16 years) 
      were screened using both methods. Overall, there was a high ECG eligibility using 
      either method (93% versus 92%, P = 0.45). Overall agreement between both methods was 
      94%. Patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) more often had a failed 
      screening test using either test in comparison to the patients without HCM (manual: 
      odds ratio [OR] 3.3, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2-9.3, P = 0.02; AST: OR 3.0, 
      95% CI 1.2-7.6, P = 0.02). CONCLUSION: AST showed a high agreement with manual 
      ECG-screening for S-ICD. Overall there was a high ECG eligibility for S-ICD, 
      although patients with HCM had a lower passing rate irrespective of the screening 
      method.

AB  - It's necessary to interrupt cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) for a reliable 
      automatic external defibrillator (AED) rhythm analysis, because the mechanical 
      activity from the chest compressions introduces artifacts in the electrocardiogram 
      (ECG) that substantially lower the capacity of an AED to judge cardio-electric 
      rhythm. However, repeated interruptions of compression will reduce the quality of 
      CPR, which in turn affect the prognosis of patients with cardiac arrest (CA). In 
      order to improve the quality of CPR, reduce the interruptions of chest compression 
      and implement accurate defibrillation, people have made many efforts on identifying 
      ECG rhythm in CPR. The studies can be grouped into two broad categories: those based 
      on the artificial mixture of ECG data and CPR artifacts and those based on CA data 
      recorded during CPR. This article introduced researches for rhythm recognition in 
      CPR, including sources and characteristics of CPR artifacts, methods of rhythm 
      analysis, and provided a basis for the study of how to improve the accuracy of 
      cardio-electric rhythm recognition.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Telehealth care is a global trend affecting clinical practice around the 
      world. To mitigate the workload of health professionals and provide ubiquitous 
      health care, a comprehensive surveillance system with value-added services based on 
      information technologies must be established. OBJECTIVE: We conducted this study to 
      describe our proposed telesurveillance system designed for monitoring and 
      classifying electrocardiogram (ECG) signals and to evaluate the performance of ECG 
      classification. METHODS: We established a telesurveillance system with an automatic 
      ECG interpretation mechanism. The system included: (1) automatic ECG signal 
      transmission via telecommunication, (2) ECG signal processing, including noise 
      elimination, peak estimation, and feature extraction, (3) automatic ECG 
      interpretation based on the support vector machine (SVM) classifier and rule-based 
      processing, and (4) display of ECG signals and their analyzed results. We analyzed 
      213,420 ECG signals that were diagnosed by cardiologists as the gold standard to 
      verify the classification performance. RESULTS: In the clinical ECG database from 
      the Telehealth Center of the National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH), the 
      experimental results showed that the ECG classifier yielded a specificity value of 
      96.66% for normal rhythm detection, a sensitivity value of 98.50% for disease 
      recognition, and an accuracy value of 81.17% for noise detection. For the detection 
      performance of specific diseases, the recognition model mainly generated sensitivity 
      values of 92.70% for atrial fibrillation, 89.10% for pacemaker rhythm, 88.60% for 
      atrial premature contraction, 72.98% for T-wave inversion, 62.21% for atrial 
      flutter, and 62.57% for first-degree atrioventricular block. CONCLUSIONS: Through 
      connected telehealth care devices, the telesurveillance system, and the automatic 
      ECG interpretation system, this mechanism was intentionally designed for continuous 
      decision-making support and is reliable enough to reduce the need for face-to-face 
      diagnosis. With this value-added service, the system could widely assist physicians 
      and other health professionals with decision making in clinical practice. The system 
      will be very helpful for the patient who suffers from cardiac disease, but for whom 
      it is inconvenient to go to the hospital very often.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a serious medical condition with increasing prevalence and 
      high mortality. The role of the autonomic nervous system in pathophysiology of 
      sepsis has been increasingly researched. The objective of this study is to evaluate 
      the Heart rate variability (HRV) as a predictor of mortality in septic patients. 
      METHODS: This was a prospective cohort of patients diagnosed with sepsis. Patient 
      recruitment was carried out at ICU in tertiary university hospital between March 
      2012 and February 2014. Clinical data and laboratory exams were collected at 
      admission. Each patient underwent a 20-minute Holter and a 24-hour Holter on the 
      first day of enrollment. The primary outcome was the 28-day all-cause mortality. 
      RESULTS: A total of 63 patients were included. Patients were categorized into 
      nonsurvivor group (n = 16) or survivor group (n = 47) depending on this endpoint. 
      Survivors were younger (48.6 years vs. 63.0 years), had better renal function and 
      lower values in severity scores (APACHE II and SOFA) compared to nonsurvivors. In 
      the 20-minute Holter, SDNN, Total Power, VLF Power, LF Power and LF/HF of 
      nonsurvivors were significantly lower than those of survivors (p = <0.001, p = 
      0.003, p = 0.002, p = 0.006, p = 0.009 respectively). ROC curve of SDNN was built, 
      showing area under the curve of 0.772 (0.638-0.906) for mortality. The value of 17ms 
      was chosen as best SDNN cutoff to discriminate survivors and nonsurvivors. In the 
      Cox proportional regression, adjusted for SOFA score and for APACHE II, a SDNN ≤ 
      17ms was associated with a greater risk of death, with hazard ratios of 6.3 
      (1.4-28.0; p = 0.015) and 5.5 (1,2-24,8; p = 0.027), respectively. The addition of 
      the dichotomized SDNN to the SOFA model reduced AIC and increased the concordance 
      statistic and the R2, indicating that predictive power of the SDNN + SOFA model is 
      better than predictive power of SOFA only. CONCLUSIONS: Several HRV parameters are 
      reduced in nonsurviving septic patients. SDNN ≤17 is a risk factor for death in 
      septic patients, even after adjusting for severity scores.

TI  - Performance of an external transtelephonic loop recorder for automated detection of 
      paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
PG  - 564-70
LID - 10.1111/anec.12075 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most commonly encountered 
      arrhythmia, some of the properties make its detection challenging. In daily 
      practice, underdiagnosis can lead to less effective treatment in prevention of 
      stroke. Based on data from studies on treatment of AF, more intensive follow-up 
      strategies, including 7-day Holter recording, 30-day event recording, and even 
      implantable cardiac monitoring devices, are suggested. The study purpose is to 
      evaluate the performance of a continuous single-channel loop recorder with automatic 
      AF detection and transtelephonic electrocardiogram (ECG) transmission capabilities. 
      METHODS AND RESULTS: A consecutive cohort of 153 patients admitted to the stroke 
      unit with a presumptive diagnosis of ischemic cerebrovascular accident was screened 
      for AF. Twenty-four-hour rhythm observation was performed using a single-channel 
      external loop recorder (ELR) configured for automated AF detection. A total of 45 
      patients with a known history of AF, AF on the admission ECG, or incomplete 
      registrations were excluded. Extensive additional frequency-based settings were used 
      to establish a reference registration. In total, 2923 recordings were transmitted. 
      We evaluated all events, of which 1190 were designated by the device as AF. The 
      sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV for identifying AF using the ELR were, 
      respectively, 93%, 51%, 5%, and 99%. CONCLUSIONS: In this ELR validation study, the 
      dedicated AF detection algorithm showed to be highly sensitive but not specific for 
      AF. Applicability of an ELR might be limited for efficacious detection of AF, as 
      manual verification is mandatory for a vast amount of recordings.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the diagnostic performance of a UK National Institute for 
      Health and Care Excellence-recommended automatic oscillometric blood pressure (BP) 
      measurement device incorporated with an atrial fibrillation (AF) detection algorithm 
      (Microlife WatchBP Home A) for real-world AF screening in a primary healthcare 
      setting. SETTING: Primary healthcare setting in Hong Kong. INTERVENTIONS: This was a 
      prospective AF screening study carried out between 1 September 2014 and 14 January 
      2015. The Microlife device was evaluated for AF detection and compared with a 
      reference standard of lead-I ECG. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Diagnostic performance 
      of Microlife for AF detection. RESULTS: 5969 patients (mean age: 67.2±11.0 years; 
      53.9% female) were recruited. The mean CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc ( C : congestive heart 
      failure [1 point]; H : hypertension [1 point]; A(2) : age 65-74 years [1 point] and 
      age ≥75 years [2 points]; D : diabetes mellitus [1 point]; S : prior stroke or 
      transient ischemic attack [2 points]; VA : vascular disease [1 point]; and Sc : sex 
      category [female] [1 point])score was 2.8±1.3. AF was diagnosed in 72 patients 
      (1.21%) and confirmed by a 12-lead ECG. The Microlife device correctly identified AF 
      in 58 patients and produced 79 false-positives. The corresponding sensitivity and 
      specificity for AF detection were 80.6% (95% CI 69.5 to 88.9) and 98.7% (95% CI 98.3 
      to 98.9), respectively. Among patients with a false-positive by the Microlife 
      device, 30.4% had sinus rhythm, 35.4% had sinus arrhythmia and 29.1% exhibited 
      premature atrial complexes. With the low prevalence of AF in this population, the 
      positive and negative predictive values of Microlife device for AF detection were 
      42.4% (95% CI 34.0 to 51.2) and 99.8% (95% CI 99.6 to 99.9), respectively. The 
      overall diagnostic performance of Microlife device to detect AF as determined by 
      area under the curves was 0.90 (95% CI 0.89 to 0.90). CONCLUSIONS: In the primary 
      care setting, Microlife WatchBP Home was an effective means to screen for AF, with a 
      reasonable sensitivity of 80.6% and a high negative predictive value of 99.8%, in 
      addition to its routine function of BP measurement. In a younger patient population 
      aged <65 years with a lower prevalence of AF, Microlife WatchBP Home A demonstrated 
      a similar diagnostic accuracy.

TI  - System for automatic heart rate calculation in epileptic seizures.
PG  - 555-564
LID - 10.1007/s13246-017-0557-z [doi]
AB  - This article presents a comprehensive system for automatic heart rate (HR) 
      detection. The system is robust and resistant to disturbances (noise, interferences, 
      artifacts) occurring mainly during epileptic seizures. ECG signal filtration (IIR) 
      and normalization due to skewness and standard deviation were used as preprocessing 
      steps. A key element of the system is a reference QRS complex pattern calculated 
      individually for each ECG recording. Next, a cross-correlation of the reference QRS 
      pattern with short, normalized ECG windows is calculated and the maxima of the 
      correlation are found (R-wave locations). Determination of the RR intervals makes 
      possible calculation of heart rate changes and also heart rate variability (HRV). 
      The algorithm was tested using a simulation in which a noise of an amplitude several 
      times higher than ECG standard deviation levels was added. The proposed algorithm is 
      characterized by high QRS detection accuracy, and high sensitivity and specificity. 
      The algorithm proved to be useful in clinical practice, where it was used to 
      automatically determine HR for ECG signals recorded before and during 58 focal 
      seizures in 56 adult patients with intractable temporal lobe epilepsy.

TI  - A modified Zeeman model for producing HRV signals and its application to ECG signal 
      generation.
PG  - 180-9
AB  - Developing a mathematical model for the artificial generation of electrocardiogram 
      (ECG) signals is a subject that has been widely investigated. One of the challenges 
      is to generate ECG signals with a wide range of waveforms, power spectra and 
      variations in heart rate variability (HRV)--all of which are important indexes of 
      human heart functions. In this paper we present a comprehensive model for generating 
      such artificial ECG signals. We incorporate into our model the effects of 
      respiratory sinus arrhythmia, Mayer waves and the important very low-frequency 
      component in the power spectrum of HRV. We use a new modified Zeeman model for 
      generating the time series for HRV, and a single cycle of ECG is produced by using a 
      simple neural network. The importance of the work is the model's ability to produce 
      artificial ECG signals that resemble experimental recordings under various 
      physiological conditions. As such the model provides a useful tool to simulate and 
      analyse the main characteristics of ECG, such as its power spectrum and HRV under 
      different conditions. Potential applications of this model include using the 
      generated ECG as a flexible signal source to assess the effectiveness of a 
      diagnostic ECG signal-processing device.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine (1) the proportion and number of clinically relevant alarms 
      based on the type of monitoring device; (2) whether patient clinical severity, based 
      on the sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score, affects the proportion of 
      clinically relevant alarms and to suggest; (3) methods for reducing clinically 
      irrelevant alarms in an intensive care unit (ICU). DESIGN: A prospective, 
      observational clinical study. SETTING: A medical ICU at the University of Tokyo 
      Hospital in Tokyo, Japan. PARTICIPANTS: All patients who were admitted directly to 
      the ICU, aged ≥18 years, and not refused active treatment were registered between 
      January and February 2012. METHODS: The alarms, alarm settings, alarm messages, 
      waveforms and video recordings were acquired in real time and saved continuously. 
      All alarms were annotated with respect to technical and clinical validity. RESULTS: 
      18 ICU patients were monitored. During 2697 patient-monitored hours, 11 591 alarms 
      were annotated. Only 740 (6.4%) alarms were considered to be clinically relevant. 
      The monitoring devices that triggered alarms the most often were the direct 
      measurement of arterial pressure (33.5%), oxygen saturation (24.2%), and 
      electrocardiogram (22.9%). The numbers of relevant alarms were 12.4% (direct 
      measurement of arterial pressure), 2.4% (oxygen saturation) and 5.3% 
      (electrocardiogram). Positive correlations were established between patient clinical 
      severities and the proportion of relevant alarms. The total number of irrelevant 
      alarms could be reduced by 21.4% by evaluating their technical relevance. 
      CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that (1) the types of devices that alarm the most 
      frequently were direct measurements of arterial pressure, oxygen saturation and ECG, 
      and most of those alarms were not clinically relevant; (2) the proportion of 
      clinically relevant alarms decreased as the patients' status improved and (3) the 
      irrelevance alarms can be considerably reduced by evaluating their technical 
      relevance.

      autonomic and repolarization ECG markers.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Considering the rates of sudden cardiac death (SCD) and pump failure 
      death (PFD) in chronic heart failure (CHF) patients and the cost-effectiveness of 
      their preventing treatments, identification of CHF patients at risk is an important 
      challenge. In this work, we studied the prognostic performance of the combination of 
      an index potentially related to dispersion of repolarization restitution (Δα), an 
      index quantifying T-wave alternans (IAA) and the slope of heart rate turbulence (TS) 
      for classification of SCD and PFD. METHODS: Holter ECG recordings of 597 CHF 
      patients with sinus rhythm enrolled in the MUSIC study were analyzed and Δα, IAA and 
      TS were obtained. A strategy was implemented using support vector machines (SVM) to 
      classify patients in three groups: SCD victims, PFD victims and other patients (the 
      latter including survivors and victims of non-cardiac causes). Cross-validation was 
      used to evaluate the performance of the implemented classifier. RESULTS: Δα and IAA, 
      dichotomized at 0.035 (dimensionless) and 3.73 μV, respectively, were the ECG 
      markers most strongly associated with SCD, while TS, dichotomized at 2.5 ms/RR, was 
      the index most strongly related to PFD. When separating SCD victims from the rest of 
      patients, the individual marker with best performance was Δα≥0.035, which, for a 
      fixed specificity (Sp) of 90%, showed a sensitivity (Se) value of 10%, while the 
      combination of Δα and IAA increased Se to 18%. For separation of PFD victims from 
      the rest of patients, the best individual marker was TS ≤ 2.5 ms/RR, which, for 
      Sp=90%, showed a Se of 26%, this value being lower than Se=34%, produced by the 
      combination of Δα and TS. Furthermore, when performing SVM classification into the 
      three reported groups, the optimal combination of risk markers led to a maximum Sp 
      of 79% (Se=18%) for SCD and Sp of 81% (Se=14%) for PFD. CONCLUSIONS: The results 
      shown in this work suggest that it is possible to efficiently discriminate SCD and 
      PFD in a population of CHF patients using ECG-derived risk markers like Δα, TS and 
      IAA.

      historical brocade developing technique, NISHIJIN-ORI. In this paper, a NISHIJIN 
      e-textile sensor belt prototype designed for ambulatory measurement (pre-hospital 
      12-lead ECG measurement) was tested on twenty volunteers. The recorded data was 
      evaluated through the result of commercial automatic ECG analyzer. The obtained 
      results are almost equivalent with the ones obtained through conventional ECG 
      electrodes. However, the results suggest slight modification of the prototype.

TI  - Automatic detection of ECG electrode misplacement: a tale of two algorithms.
PG  - 1549-61
LID - 10.1088/0967-3334/33/9/1549 [doi]
AB  - Artifacts in an electrocardiogram (ECG) due to electrode misplacement can lead to 
      wrong diagnoses. Various computer methods have been developed for automatic 
      detection of electrode misplacement. Here we reviewed and compared the performance 
      of two algorithms with the highest accuracies on several databases from PhysioNet. 
      These algorithms were implemented into four models. For clean ECG records with 
      clearly distinguishable waves, the best model produced excellent accuracies (> = 
      98.4%) for all misplacements except the LA/LL interchange (87.4%). However, the 
      accuracies were significantly lower for records with noise and arrhythmias. 
      Moreover, when the algorithms were tested on a database that was independent from 
      the training database, the accuracies may be poor. For the worst scenario, the best 
      accuracies for different types of misplacements ranged from 36.1% to 78.4%. A large 
      number of ECGs of various qualities and pathological conditions are collected every 
      day. To improve the quality of health care, the results of this paper call for more 
      robust and accurate algorithms for automatic detection of electrode misplacement, 
      which should be developed and tested using a database of extensive ECG records.

TI  - Non-contact monitoring of heart rate variability using medical radar for the 
      evaluation of dynamic changes in autonomic nervous activity during a head-up tilt

AB  - Electrocardiography (ECG) is a mandatory standard for monitoring electrical activity 
      of the heart in many clinical settings such as intensive care and emergency units. 
      However, in situations wherein the skin is damaged, such as acute burn injuries, it 
      is impossible to efficiently attach electrodes to the skin. In this study, we 
      developed a non-contact cardiac monitoring system using a 24-GHz medical radar for 
      directly measuring the beat-to-beat heart mechanical activity at a distance from a 
      subject. The heart rate variability (HRV) was analysed using an autoregressive model 
      (AR) from the measured beat-to-beat intervals during a head-up tilt test. To 
      investigate the feasibility of the proposed system, we compared medical radar and 
      ECG recording by using Lin's correlation coefficient and Bland-Altman analysis, 
      which showed a negligible mean difference from the substantial agreement of Lin's 
      correlation coefficient of 0.9 between the radar and ECG. The non-contact radar 
      clearly monitored dynamic changes in HRV indices induced by the head-up tilt test. 
      This type of non-contact HRV-sensing technique as an alternative approach has 
      significant potential for advancing personal healthcare in both clinical and 
      out-of-hospital settings.

AB  - HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVE: Prolonged QT interval is an index of propensity for dangerous 
      ventricular tachyarrhythmias. The aim of this article is to establish an automatic 
      algorithm for QT interval measurement. METHOD: The proposed method is based on the 
      continuous wavelet transform. In this method, the concepts of the rescaled wavelet 
      coefficients and dominant scales of the electrocardiogram (ECG) components are used 
      to perform detection of ECG characteristic points. A new concept of rescaled maximum 
      energy density is introduced so as to perform the estimation of the QT interval. 
      RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: We have applied the algorithm to the PTB database of the 
      Physiobank∖Physionet in lead II. Then, the results were evaluated using pertinent 
      reference QT. The criterion used for evaluation of the method's performance is the 
      root mean square (RMS) error. The method approached the RMS error of 27.89 ms for 
      549 subjects. The proposed method is fast, simple and is applicable to a wide range 
      of ECG cardio cycle morphologies.

TI  - Heart rate variability analysis of normal and growth restricted children.
PG  - 91-7
LID - 10.1007/s10286-011-0149-z [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) has been associated with an 
      increased risk of cardiovascular disease in later life. The regularity mechanism of 
      cardiovascular system is under the control of autonomic nervous system (ANS). The 
      non-optimal fetal growth may alter the development of the ANS and this appears to 
      persist in later life. The aim of the present work is to analyse the synergic 
      activity of the ANS in normal and growth restricted children. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 
      Heart rate variability analysis from 24 h ECG recordings of 70 children between 9 
      and 10 years old, normal and IUGR was performed using linear and non-linear time 
      series analysis techniques. CONCLUSION: The HRV parameters showed no significant 
      difference between normal and IUGR children. Low birth weight and its association 
      with development of the cardiovascular system and its control have been extensively 
      studied. In order to investigate the effect of low birth weight on HRV parameters, 
      the IUGR children were further divided into two groups: IUGR-1 (birth weight<2.50 
      kg) and IUGR-2 (birth weight≥2.50 kg). The results demonstrated that most of the HRV 
      measures showed significant differences between normal versus IUGR-1 as well as 
      IUGR-1 versus IUGR-2 groups. The effect of gender on HRV measures was also examined 
      and we noticed that girls had lower HRV than boys.

TI  - Non-Electrocardiogram-Triggered 70-kVp High-Pitch Computed Tomography Angiography of 
      the Whole Aorta With Iterative Reconstruction: Initial Results.
PG  - 109-17
LID - 10.1097/RCT.0000000000000329 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the feasibility of non-electrocardiogram (ECG)-triggered 
      70-kVp high-pitch aortic computed tomography angiography (CTA) with iterative 
      reconstruction (IR) and reduced contrast agent using second-generation dual-source 
      CT (DSCT). METHODS: Seventy-seven patients were examined: group A (n = 21), 70-kVp 
      high-pitch (3.2) CTA, 60 mL contrast agent and IR on second-generation DSCT; group B 
      (n = 29), standard-pitch (1.2) CTA, automatic tube voltage selection, filtered back 
      projection and 80 mL contrast agent on second-generation DSCT; group C (n = 27), 
      120-kVp standard-pitch (1.2) CTA, filtered back projection, and 80 mL contrast agent 
      on first-generation DSCT. Computed tomography values, noise, signal-to-noise ratio, 
      contrast-to-noise ratio, and subjective image quality were compared. RESULTS: 
      Computed tomography values and noise of all aortic segments in group A were 
      increased compared with groups B and C (P < 0.05). Group B showed the highest 
      signal-to-noise ratio and contrast-to-noise ratio for all aortic segments (P < 
      0.05), whereas no significant differences were found between groups A and C (P > 
      0.05). Mean effective dose was 0.88 ± 0.08 mSv for group A, reduced by 93% compared 
      to group C and by 90% compared to group B. CONCLUSIONS: Non-ECG-triggered 70-kVp 
      high-pitch aortic CTA with IR provides equivalent diagnostic image quality with 90% 
      reduction of radiation dose and 25% reduction of contrast volume compared with 
      standard 120-kVp CTA.

TI  - Classification and assessment of computerized diagnostic criteria for Brugada-type 
      electrocardiograms.
PG  - 1660-6
LID - 10.1016/j.hrthm.2010.06.035 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although a Brugada-type electrocardiogram (ECG) is occasionally detected 
      in mass health screening examinations in apparently healthy individuals, the 
      automatic computerized diagnostic criteria for Brugada-type ECGs have not been 
      established. OBJECTIVE: This study was performed to establish the criteria for the 
      computerized diagnosis of Brugada-type ECGs and to evaluate their diagnostic 
      accuracy. METHODS: We examined the ECG parameters in leads V1 to V3 in patients with 
      Brugada syndrome and cases with right bundle branch block. Based on the above 
      parameters, we classified the ECGs into 3 types of Brugada-type ECGs, and the 
      conditions for defining each type were explored as the diagnostic criteria. The 
      diagnostic effectiveness of the proposed criteria was assessed using 548 ECGs from 
      49 cases with Brugada-type ECGs and the recordings from 192,673 cases (36,674 adults 
      and 155,999 school children) obtained from their annual health examinations. 
      RESULTS: The Brugada-type ST-segment elevation in V1 to V3 was classified into 3 
      types, types 1, 2/3, and a suggestive Brugada ECG (type S). The automatic diagnostic 
      criteria for each type were established by the J-point amplitude, ST-segment 
      elevation with its amplitude and configuration, as well as the T-wave morphology in 
      leads V1 to V3. CONCLUSION: The proposed criteria demonstrated a reasonable accuracy 
      (type 1: 91.9%, type 2/3: 86.2%, type S: 76.2%) for diagnosing Brugada-type ECG in 
      comparison to the macroscopic diagnosis by experienced observers. Moreover, the 
      automatic criteria had a comparable detection rate (0.6% in adults, 0.16% in 
      children) of Brugada-type ECGs to the macroscopic inspection in the health screening 
      examinations.

AB  - BACKGROUND: ECG cable interchange can generate erroneous diagnoses. For algorithms 
      detecting ECG cable interchange, high specificity is required to maintain a low 
      total false positive rate because the prevalence of interchange is low. In this 
      study, we propose and evaluate an improved algorithm for automatic detection and 
      classification of ECG cable interchange. METHOD: The algorithm was developed by 
      using both ECG morphology information and redundancy information. ECG morphology 
      features included QRS-T and P-wave amplitude, frontal axis and clockwise vector loop 
      rotation. The redundancy features were derived based on the EASI™ lead system 
      transformation. The classification was implemented using linear support vector 
      machine. The development database came from multiple sources including both normal 
      subjects and cardiac patients. An independent database was used to test the 
      algorithm performance. Common cable interchanges were simulated by swapping either 
      limb cables or precordial cables. RESULTS: For the whole validation database, the 
      overall sensitivity and specificity for detecting precordial cable interchange were 
      56.5% and 99.9%, and the sensitivity and specificity for detecting limb cable 
      interchange (excluding left arm-left leg interchange) were 93.8% and 99.9%. Defining 
      precordial cable interchange or limb cable interchange as a single positive event, 
      the total false positive rate was 0.7%. When the algorithm was designed for higher 
      sensitivity, the sensitivity for detecting precordial cable interchange increased to 
      74.6% and the total false positive rate increased to 2.7%, while the sensitivity for 
      detecting limb cable interchange was maintained at 93.8%. The low total false 
      positive rate was maintained at 0.6% for the more abnormal subset of the validation 
      database including only hypertrophy and infarction patients. CONCLUSION: The 
      proposed algorithm can detect and classify ECG cable interchanges with high 
      specificity and low total false positive rate, at the cost of decreased sensitivity 
      for certain precordial cable interchanges. The algorithm could also be configured 
      for higher sensitivity for different applications where a lower specificity can be 
      tolerated.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We propose a heartbeat-based end-to-end classification of arrhythmias to 
      improve the classification performance for supraventricular ectopic beat (SVEB) and 
      ventricular ectopic beat (VEB). METHODS: The ECG signals were preprocessed by 
      heartbeat segmentation and heartbeat alignment. An arrhythmia classifier was 
      constructed based on convolutional neural network, and the proposed loss function 
      was used to train the classifier. RESULTS: The proposed algorithm was verified on 
      MIT-BIH arrhythmia database. The AUC of the proposed loss function for SVEB and VEB 
      reached 0.77 and 0.98, respectively. With the first 5 min segment as the local data, 
      the diagnostic sensitivities for SVEB and VEB were 78.28% and 98.88%, respectively; 
      when 0, 50, 100, and 150 samples were used as the local data, the diagnostic 
      sensitivities for SVEB and VEB reached 82.25% and 93.23%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: 
      The proposed method effectively reduces the negative impact of class-imbalance and 
      improves the diagnostic sensitivities for SVEB and VEB, and thus provides a new 
      solution for automatic arrhythmia classification.

AB  - The origin of heart rate variability (HRV) is largely in parasympathetic activity. 
      The direct influence of sympathetic activity and other control mechanisms, 
      especially at an increased HR, is not well understood. The objectives of the study 
      were to investigate the influence of increasing HR on the properties of heartbeat 
      interval (RR) series in young healthy subjects. ECG was recorded in 9 trained and 11 
      untrained young men during supine rest, standing, incremental running exercise and 
      relaxation. During exercise, a breath-to-breath gas exchange was monitored. The RR 
      time series analysis included the spectral analysis, detrended fluctuations analysis 
      method and sample entropy (SampEn) calculation. During exercise, spectral powers 
      were reduced dramatically in both groups. The dependence of short-term scaling 
      exponent (alpha(1)) on the RR included a characteristic maximum, while SampEn for 
      the same value of the RR had a minimum. The value of HR corresponding to the maximum 
      of alpha(1) and minimum of SampEn (IHR) corresponded to the intrinsic HR obtained by 
      an autonomic blockade. In trained subjects, the curves alpha(1) versus RR and SampEn 
      versus RR were moved toward larger RR, compared with control. For HR values higher 
      than IHR, alpha(1) decreased and SampEn increased. These results reveal that the 
      complexity of the heart rhythm above intrinsic HR decreases with an increase in HR. 
      We suggest that at the highest HR intrinsic heart control is reflected in the heart 
      rhythm. We point out the possibility of developing a new non-invasive method for the 
      determination of intrinsic HR from the curve alpha(1) versus RR.

AB  - Octreotide is a somatostatin analogue used to control upper gastrointestinal 
      bleeding. We report a case of a patient with no significant cardiac history who had 
      multiple asystolic events during an octreotide infusion at a relatively low dose. 
      Although octreotide leading to bradycardia and heart block has been documented in 
      several case reports, to our knowledge, octreotide-associated asystole has not been 
      described. It is pertinent that physicians must be aware of this significant cardiac 
      effect for vigilant cardiac monitoring and management, preferably in an intensive 
      care setting. Furthermore, this suggests that although dose- and route-related 
      effects have been described, some individuals may be susceptible at low doses, even 
      in the absence of heart disease. There were no further recurrences after the drug 
      was discontinued.

      students.
PG  - 345-60
AB  - Effective regulation of emotions requires the ability to voluntarily manage 
      attention, i.e. attentional control (AC), which has been related to heart rate 
      variability and vagal tone in laboratory based research. In this study, we 
      calculated the correlation dimension (CD), the fractal-like properties (scaling 
      exponents ?1 and ?2, and fractal dimension) and the sample entropy of heart rate 
      time series obtained from ECG recordings (4 hours long each) taken from a sample of 
      healthy students (n=47) during everyday activities. AC was assessed through a 
      self-reported questionnaire. As expected, a linear positive correlation was found 
      between AC scores and CD and entropy, but no associations were found between AC and 
      ?1 and fractal dimension. The association between AC and ?2 was negative and 
      marginally significant. No associations were found between AC and linear heart rate 
      variability measures. These results show that nonlinear measures of long, everyday 
      life, heart rate time series may provide useful information about the AC ability of 
      healthy students.

TI  - Insights into the problem of alarm fatigue with physiologic monitor devices: a 
      comprehensive observational study of consecutive intensive care unit patients.
PG  - e110274

LID - e110274
AB  - PURPOSE: Physiologic monitors are plagued with alarms that create a cacophony of 
      sounds and visual alerts causing "alarm fatigue" which creates an unsafe patient 
      environment because a life-threatening event may be missed in this milieu of sensory 
      overload. Using a state-of-the-art technology acquisition infrastructure, all 
      monitor data including 7 ECG leads, all pressure, SpO(2), and respiration waveforms 
      as well as user settings and alarms were stored on 461 adults treated in intensive 
      care units. Using a well-defined alarm annotation protocol, nurse scientists with 
      95% inter-rater reliability annotated 12,671 arrhythmia alarms. RESULTS: A total of 
      2,558,760 unique alarms occurred in the 31-day study period: arrhythmia, 1,154,201; 
      parameter, 612,927; technical, 791,632. There were 381,560 audible alarms for an 
      audible alarm burden of 187/bed/day. 88.8% of the 12,671 annotated arrhythmia alarms 
      were false positives. Conditions causing excessive alarms included inappropriate 
      alarm settings, persistent atrial fibrillation, and non-actionable events such as 
      PVC's and brief spikes in ST segments. Low amplitude QRS complexes in some, but not 
      all available ECG leads caused undercounting and false arrhythmia alarms. Wide QRS 
      complexes due to bundle branch block or ventricular pacemaker rhythm caused false 
      alarms. 93% of the 168 true ventricular tachycardia alarms were not sustained long 
      enough to warrant treatment. DISCUSSION: The excessive number of physiologic monitor 
      alarms is a complex interplay of inappropriate user settings, patient conditions, 
      and algorithm deficiencies. Device solutions should focus on use of all available 
      ECG leads to identify non-artifact leads and leads with adequate QRS amplitude. 
      Devices should provide prompts to aide in more appropriate tailoring of alarm 
      settings to individual patients. Atrial fibrillation alarms should be limited to new 
      onset and termination of the arrhythmia and delays for ST-segment and other 
      parameter alarms should be configurable. Because computer devices are more reliable 
      than humans, an opportunity exists to improve physiologic monitoring and reduce 
      alarm fatigue.

AB  - Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia associated with a 
      major economic burden for the society. Automatic detection of AF in long term 
      recordings can efficiently assist in early diagnosis and management of comorbidities 
      associated with AF. This study presents a novel approach for AF detection based on 
      Inter Beat Intervals (IBI) extracted from long term electrocardiogram (ECG) 
      recordings. Five time-domain features are extracted from the IBIs and a Support 
      Vector Machine (SVM) is used for classification. The results are compared to a state 
      of the art algorithm based on raw ECG. Both algorithms are evaluated on the MIT-BIH 
      Atrial Fibrillation database resulting in equally high classification performance 
      (Sensitivity ≥ 95%). The proposed approach requires detection of R-peaks in the ECG 
      signal but allows for significantly reduced computation time without loss of 
      performance.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The goal of this study was to compare the time series predictors of 
      beat-to-beat variability in repolarization in healthy individuals. METHODS: Spatial 
      QRS- and T-vector amplitudes, spatial QRS-T, RR' and TT' angles, RR' and QT 
      intervals, and QRS- and T-loop roundness were measured on 453 consecutive sinus 
      beats in 168 healthy subjects (mean age 39.8±15.6years; 50% men; 93% white). Panel 
      time-series regression models were adjusted by age, sex, and race. Appropriate time 
      series of ECG metrics served as predictors and outcomes. RESULTS: Increase in T-loop 
      roundness index by 0.1 was associated with 1.1° (95%CI 0.9-2.2; P=0.048) increase in 
      corresponding TT' angle. One unit increase in a respiration index was associated 
      with 4ms (95%CI 0.6-7.0; P=0.021) increase in QT interval. CONCLUSIONS: Spatial TT' 
      angle and beat-to-beat variability in T-loop roundness represent intrinsic measures 
      of repolarization variability. QT interval variability characterizes the effect of 
      respiration and heart rate variability.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Measurement of myocardial T2* is becoming widely used in the assessment 
      of patients at risk for cardiac iron overload. The conventional breath-hold, 
      ECG-triggered, segmented, multi-echo gradient echo (MGRE) sequence used for 
      myocardial T2* quantification is very sensitive to respiratory motion and may not be 
      feasible in patients who are unable to breath-hold. We propose a free-breathing 
      myocardial T2* mapping approach that combines a single-shot gradient-echo 
      echo-planar imaging (GRE-EPI) sequence for T2*-weighted image acquisition with 
      automatic non-rigid motion correction (MOCO) of respiratory motion between 
      single-shot images. METHODS: ECG-triggered T2*-weighted images at different echo 
      times were acquired by a black-blood, single-shot GRE-EPI sequence during 
      free-breathing. A single image at a single TE is acquired in each heartbeat. 
      Automatic non-rigid MOCO was applied to correct for in-plane respiratory motion 
      before pixel-wise T2* mapping. In a total of 117 patients referred for clinical 
      cardiac magnetic resonance exams, the free-breathing MOCO GRE-EPI sequence was 
      compared to the breath-hold segmented MGRE approach. Image quality was scored 
      independently by 2 experienced observers blinded to the particular image acquisition 
      strategy. T2* measurements in the interventricular septum and in the liver were 
      compared for the two methods in all cases with adequate image quality. RESULTS: T2* 
      maps were acquired in all 117 patients using the breath-hold MGRE and the 
      free-breathing MOCO GRE-EPI approaches, including 8 patients with myocardial iron 
      overload and 25 patients with hepatic iron overload. The mean image quality of the 
      free-breathing MOCO GRE-EPI images was scored significantly higher than that of the 
      breath-hold MGRE images by both reviewers. Out of the 117 studies, 21 breath-hold 
      MGRE studies (17.9% of all the patients) were scored to be less than adequate or 
      very poor by both reviewers, while only 2 free-breathing MOCO GRE-EPI studies were 
      scored to be less than adequate image quality. In a comparative evaluation of the 
      images with at least adequate quality, the intra-class correlation coefficients for 
      myocardial and liver T2* were 0.868 and 0.986 respectively (p < 0.001), indicating 
      that the T2* measured by breath-hold MGRE and free-breathing MOCO GRE-EPI were in 
      close agreement. The coefficient of variation between the breath-hold and 
      free-breathing approaches for myocardial and liver T2* were 9.88% and 9.38% 
      respectively. Bland-Altman plots demonstrated good absolute agreement of T2* in the 
      interventricular septum and the liver from the free-breathing and breath-hold 
      approaches (mean differences -0.03 and 0.16 ms, respectively). CONCLUSION: The 
      free-breathing approach described for T2* mapping using MOCO GRE-EPI enables 
      accurate myocardial and liver T2* measurements and is insensitive to respiratory 
      motion.

TI  - [Initial observation of oxygen carriers with acute myocardial infarction in rats].
PG  - 1095-9
AB  - The purpose of this study was to test whether oxygen carriers could decrease tissue 
      injury in a rat model of acute myocardial infarct. The study included 3 groups: SD 
      rats in group II and group III were subjected to permanent occlusion of their left 
      anterior descending coronary arteries; SD rats in group I were subjected to 
      sham-operation. The success of modeling was assartained by ECG. Then the rats were 
      given drug via caudal veins for 2 days. A quantitative evaluation was made with an 
      automatic device for interpretation of cardiac troponin T (cTnT); heart staining was 
      made for the calculation of myocardial infarction size (MIS); and myocardial tissue 
      was taken and subjected to routine pathological hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining for 
      showing myocardial cell injury. cTnT in the sham-operation group was significantly 
      lower by comparison with that in the model group (P < 0.01), and it was slightly 
      lower in the oxygen carriers group than that in the model group, but there was no 
      statistically significant difference (P = 0.18); MIS was significantly smaller in 
      the sham-operation group than that in the model group (P < 0.01), and it was greater 
      in the model rats than that in the oxygen carriers rats (P < 0.05). HE staining of 
      myocardicum in the oxygen carriers group was significantly better than that in the 
      model group (P < 0.01). The evidence suggested that oxygen carriers increased oxygen 
      supply to ischemic myocardium, reduced the myocardial injury, and thus might offer a 
      novel treatment of myocardial infarction.

TI  - The impact of artifact correction methods of RR series on heart rate variability 
      parameters.
PG  - 646-652
LID - 10.1152/japplphysiol.00927.2016 [doi]
AB  - Heart rate variability (HRV) analysis is widely used to investigate the autonomic 
      regulation of the cardiovascular system. HRV is often analyzed using RR time series, 
      which can be affected by different types of artifacts. Although there are several 
      artifact correction methods, there is no study that compares their performances in 
      actual experimental contexts. This work aimed to evaluate the impact of different 
      artifact correction methods on several HRV parameters. Initially, 36 ECG recordings 
      of control rats or rats with heart failure or hypertension were analyzed to 
      characterize artifact occurrence rates and distributions, to be mimicked in 
      simulations. After a rigorous analysis, only 16 recordings ( n = 16) with 
      artifact-free segments of at least 10,000 beats were selected. RR interval losses 
      were then simulated in the artifact-free (reference) time series according to real 
      observations. Correction methods applied to simulated series were deletion, linear 
      interpolation, cubic spline interpolation, modified moving average window, and 
      nonlinear predictive interpolation. Linear (time- and frequency-domain) and 
      nonlinear HRV parameters were calculated from corrupted-corrected time series, as 
      well as for reference series to evaluate the accuracy of each correction method. 
      Results show that NPI provides the overall best performance. However, several 
      correction approaches, for example the simple deletion procedure, can provide good 
      performance in some situations, depending on the HRV parameters under consideration. 
      NEW & NOTEWORTHY This work analyzes the performance of some correction techniques 
      commonly applied to the missing beats problem in RR time series. From artifact-free 
      RR series, spurious values were inserted based on actual data of experimental 
      settings. We intend our work to be a guide to show how artifacts should be corrected 
      to preserve as much as possible the original heart rate variability properties.

AB  - Resistive loading affects the breathing pattern and causes an increase in negative 
      intrathoracic pressure. The aim of this paper was to study the influence inspiratory 
      and expiratory loading on cardio-respiratory interaction. We recorded 
      electrocardiogram (ECG) and respiratory inductance plethysmogram (RIP) in 11 healthy 
      male subjects under normal and resistive loading conditions. The R-R time series 
      were extracted from the ECG and respiratory phases were calculated from the ribcage 
      and abdominal RIP using the Hilbert transform. Both the series were transformed into 
      ternary symbol vectors based on the changes between two successive R-R intervals or 
      respiratory phases, respectively. Subsequently, words of length `3 digits' were 
      formed and the correspondence between words of the two series was determined to 
      quantify cardio-respiratory interaction. Adding inspiratory and expiratory resistive 
      loads resulted in an increase in inspiratory and expiatory time, respectively. 
      Furthermore, we observed a significant increase in cardio-respiratory interaction 
      during inspiratory resistive loading as compared to expiratory resistive loading 
      (ribcage: 22.1±7.2 vs. 12.5±4.3 %, p<;0.0001; abdomen: 18.8±8.5 vs. 12.1±3.1 %, 
      p<;0.05, respectively). Further studies may aid in better understanding the 
      underlying physiological mechanisms and management of patients with breathing 
      disorders.

TI  - The Impact of Time to Rate Control of Junctional Ectopic Tachycardia After 
      Congenital Heart Surgery.
PG  - 685-690
LID - 10.1177/2150135117732544 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Junctional ectopic tachycardia (JET) after congenital heart disease 
      (CHD) surgery is often self-limiting but is associated with increased risk of 
      morbidity and mortality. Contributing factors and impact of time to achieve rate 
      control of JET are poorly described. METHODS: From January 2010 to June 2015, a 
      retrospective, single-center cohort study was performed of children who developed 
      JET after CHD surgery . We classified the cohort into two groups: patients who 
      achieved rate control of JET in ≤24 hours and in >24 hours. We examined factors 
      associated with time to rate control and compared clinical outcomes (mortality, 
      duration of mechanical ventilation, length of intensive care unit [ICU], and 
      hospital stay) between the two groups. RESULTS: Our cohort included 27 children, 
      with a median age of 3 (interquartile range: 0.7-38] months. The most common CHD 
      lesions were ventricular septal defect (n = 10, 37%), tetralogy of Fallot (n = 7, 
      25.9%), and transposition of the great arteries (n = 4, 14.8%). In all, 15 (55.6%) 
      and 12 (44.4%) patients achieved rate control of JET in ≤24 hours and >24 hours, 
      respectively. There was a difference in median mechanical ventilation time (97 
      [21-145) vs 311 [100-676] hours; P = .013) and ICU stay (5.0 [2.0-8.0] vs 15.5 
      [5.5-32.8] days, P = .023) between the patients who achieved faster rate control 
      than those who didn't. There was no difference in length of hospital stay and 
      mortality between the groups. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated that time to 
      achieve rate control of JET was associated with increased duration of mechanical 
      ventilation and ICU stay.

TI  - Reliability of Lagged Poincaré Plot Parameters in Ultrashort Heart Rate Variability 
      Series: Application on Affective Sounds.
PG  - 741-749
LID - 10.1109/JBHI.2017.2694999 [doi]
AB  - The number of studies about ultrashort cardiovascular time series is increasing 
      because of the demand for mobile applications in telemedicine and e-health 
      monitoring. However, the current literature still needs a proper validation of 
      heartbeat nonlinear dynamics assessment from ultrashort time series. This paper 
      reports on the reliability of the Lagged Poincaré Plot (LPP) parameters-calculated 
      from ultrashort cardiovascular time series. Reliability is studied on simulated as 
      well as on real RR series. Simulated RR series are generated and LPP parameters 
      estimated for ultrashort time series (from 15 to 60 s) are compared to those 
      estimated from 1 h. All LPP parameters estimated from time series longer than 35 s 
      presented a Spearman's correlation coefficient higher than 0.99. RR series acquired 
      from 32 healthy subjects during 5-min resting state sessions are used to test the 
      LPP approach in experimental data. The usefulness of ultrashort term parameters in 
      real data is accomplished also studying their ability to discriminate positive and 
      negative valence of auditory stimuli taken from the International Affective

AB  - Time series analysis with nonlinear delay differential equations (DDEs) reveals 
      nonlinear as well as spectral properties of the underlying dynamical system. Here, 
      global DDE models were used to analyze 5 min data segments of electrocardiographic 
      (ECG) recordings in order to capture distinguishing features for different heart 
      conditions such as normal heart beat, congestive heart failure, and atrial 
      fibrillation. The number of terms and delays in the model as well as the order of 
      nonlinearity of the model have to be selected that are the most discriminative. The 
      DDE model form that best separates the three classes of data was chosen by 
      exhaustive search up to third order polynomials. Such an approach can provide deep 
      insight into the nature of the data since linear terms of a DDE correspond to the 
      main time-scales in the signal and the nonlinear terms in the DDE are related to 
      nonlinear couplings between the harmonic signal parts. The DDEs were able to detect 
      atrial fibrillation with an accuracy of 72%, congestive heart failure with an 
      accuracy of 88%, and normal heart beat with an accuracy of 97% from 5 min of ECG, a 
      much shorter time interval than required to achieve comparable performance with 
      other methods.

TI  - The Ornstein-Uhlenbeck third-order Gaussian process (OUGP) applied directly to the

AB  - The heart rate variability signal derived from the ECG is a beat-to-beat record of 
      RR-intervals and is, as a time series, irregularly sampled. It is common engineering 
      practice to resample this record, typically at 4 Hz, onto a regular time axis for 
      conventional analysis using IIR and FIR filters, and power spectral estimators, in 
      the time and frequency domain, respectively. However, such interpolative resampling 
      introduces noise into the signal and the information quality is compromised. Here, 
      the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck third-order band-pass filter is presented which operates on 
      data sampled at arbitrary time and preserves fidelity. The algorithm is available as 
      open source code for MATLAB(®) (MathWorks™ Inc.) and supported by an interactive 
      website at http://clinengnhs.liv.ac.uk/OUGP.htm.

TI  - Robust classification of neonatal apnoea-related desaturations.
PG  - 1503-16
LID - 10.1088/0967-3334/33/9/1503 [doi]
AB  - Respiratory signals monitored in the neonatal intensive care units are usually 
      ignored due to the high prevalence of noise and false alarms (FA). Apneic events are 
      generally therefore indicated by a pulse oximeter alarm reacting to the subsequent 
      desaturation. However, the high FA rate in the photoplethysmogram may desensitize 
      staff, reducing the reaction speed. The main reason for the high FA rates of 
      critical care monitors is the unimodal analysis behaviour. In this work, we propose 
      a multimodal analysis framework to reduce the FA rate in neonatal apnoea monitoring. 
      Information about oxygen saturation, heart rate, respiratory rate and signal quality 
      was extracted from electrocardiogram, impedance pneumogram and photoplethysmographic 
      signals for a total of 20 features in the 5 min interval before a desaturation 
      event. 1616 desaturation events from 27 neonatal admissions were annotated by two 
      independent reviewers as true (physiologically relevant) or false (noise-related). 
      Patients were divided into two independent groups for training and validation, and a 
      support vector machine was trained to classify the events as true or false. The best 
      classification performance was achieved on a combination of 13 features with 
      sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of 100% in the training set, and a sensitivity 
      of 86%, a specificity of 91% and an accuracy of 90% in the validation set.

TI  - An automatic patient-adapted ECG heartbeat classifier allowing expert assistance.
PG  - 2312-20
LID - 10.1109/TBME.2012.2202662 [doi]
AB  - In this paper, we present a patient-adaptable algorithm for ECG heartbeat 
      classification, based on a previously developed automatic classifier and a 
      clustering algorithm. Both classifier and clustering algorithms include features 
      from the RR interval series and morphology descriptors calculated from the wavelet 
      transform. Integrating the decisions of both classifiers, the presented algorithm 
      can work either automatically or with several degrees of assistance. The algorithm 
      was comprehensively evaluated in several ECG databases for comparison purposes. Even 
      in the fully automatic mode, the algorithm slightly improved the performance figures 
      of the original automatic classifier; just with less than two manually annotated 
      heartbeats (MAHB) per recording, the algorithm obtained a mean improvement for all 
      databases of 6.9% in accuracy A, of 6.5% in global sensitivity S and of 8.9% in 
      global positive predictive value P(+). An assistance of just 12 MAHB per recording 
      resulted in a mean improvement of 13.1% in A, of 13.9% in S, and of 36.1% in P(+). 
      For the assisted mode, the algorithm outperformed other state-of-the-art classifiers 
      with less expert annotation effort. The results presented in this paper represent an 
      improvement in the field of automatic and patient-adaptable heartbeats 
      classification, concluding that the performance of an automatic classifier can be 
      improved with an efficient handling of the expert assistance.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Identifying Atrial Ventricular Hypertrophy Electrocardiogram (AVH ECG)and 
      diagnosing the classification of theirs automatically. METHODS: The ECG data used in 
      this experiment was collected from the First Affiliated Hospital of China Medical 
      University. CNN are combined with conventional methods and a 10 layers of one 
      dimensional CNN are created in this experiment to extract the features of ECG 
      signals automatically and achieve the function of classifying. ROC, sensitivity and 
      F1-score are used here to evaluate the effects of the model. RESULTS: In the 
      experiment of identifying AVH ECG, the AUC of test dataset is 0.991, while in the 
      experiment of classifying AVH ECG, the maximal F1-score can reach 0.992. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The CNN model created in this experiment can achieve the auxiliary 
      diagnosis of AVH ECG.

AB  - As the symptoms and signs of heart diseases that cause sudden cardiac death, cardiac 
      arrhythmia has attracted great attention. Due to limitations in time and space, 
      traditional approaches to cardiac arrhythmias detection fail to provide a real-time 
      continuous monitoring and testing service applicable in different environmental 
      conditions. Integrated with the latest technologies in ECG (electrocardiograph) 
      analysis and medical care, the pervasive computing technology makes possible the 
      ubiquitous cardiac care services, and thus brings about new technical challenges, 
      especially in the formation of cardiac care architecture and realization of the 
      real-time automatic ECG detection algorithm dedicated to care devices. In this 
      paper, a ubiquitous cardiac care prototype system is presented with its architecture 
      framework well elaborated. This prototype system has been tested and evaluated in 
      all the clinical-/home-/outdoor-care modes with a satisfactory performance in 
      providing real-time continuous cardiac arrhythmias monitoring service unlimitedly 
      adaptable in time and space.

LID - 10.1007/s10517-016-3382-6 [doi]
AB  - The first 10 min of electrically provoked ventricular fibrillation in dogs with 
      ischemic heart disease were characterized by organized myocardial activity evidenced 
      by the dominant ECG frequency structure. During the first 2 min of ventricular 
      fibrillation, low-frequency oscillations (4-7 Hz) dominated, while on min 3 to 10 
      after the onset of fibrillation, the dominant frequencies were low and medium (4-12 
      Hz). After 10-min fibrillation, the oscillations became non-dominant. Thus, ischemic 
      myocardium maintains the organized structure of ventricular fibrillation for the 
      first 10 min, which is important for the development of automatic diagnostics of 
      abnormal cardiac activity in humans.

TI  - The QT Scale: A Weight Scale Measuring the QTc Interval.
LID - 10.1111/anec.12378 [doi]
LID - e12378
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Despite the strong evidence of the clinical utility of QTc 
      prolongation as a surrogate marker of cardiac risk, QTc measurement is not part of 
      clinical routine either in hospital or in physician offices. We evaluated a novel 
      device ("the QT scale") to measure heart rate (HR) and QTc interval. METHOD: The QT 
      scale is a weight scale embedding an ECG acquisition system with four limb sensors 
      (feet and hands: lead I, II, and III). We evaluated the reliability of QT scale in 
      healthy subjects (cohort 1) and cardiac patients (cohorts 2 and 3) considering a 
      learning (cohort 2) and two validation cohorts. The QT scale and the standard 
      12-lead recorder were compared using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) in 
      cohorts 2 and 3. Absolute value of heart rate and QTc intervals between manual and 
      automatic measurements using ECGs from the QT scale and a clinical device were 
      compared in cohort 1. RESULTS: We enrolled 16 subjects in cohort 1 (8 w, 8 m; 32 ± 8 
      vs 34 ± 10 years, P = 0.7), 51 patients in cohort 2 (13 w, 38 m; 61 ± 16 vs 58 ± 18 
      years, P = 0.6), and 13 AF patients in cohort 3 (4 w, 9 m; 63 ± 10 vs 64 ± 10 years, 
      P = 0.9). Similar automatic heart rate and QTc were delivered by the scale and the 
      clinical device in cohort 1: paired difference in RR and QTc were -7 ± 34 
      milliseconds (P = 0.37) and 3.4 ± 28.6 milliseconds (P = 0.64), respectively. The 
      measurement of stability was slightly lower in ECG from the QT scale than from the 
      clinical device (ICC: 91% vs 80%) in cohort 3. CONCLUSION: The "QT scale device" 
      delivers valid heart rate and QTc interval measurements.

LID - 10.1007/s00246-012-0425-2 [doi]
AB  - Measurements of the Q-T interval are less reliable in children than in adults. 
      Identification of superior diagnostic tools is warranted. This study aimed to 
      investigate whether a vectorcardiogram (VCG) recorded from three orthogonal leads 
      (X, Y, Z) according to Frank is superior to a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) in 
      providing a correct long Q-T syndrome (LQTS) diagnosis in children. This LQTS group 
      consisted of 35 genetically confirmed carriers of mutations in the KCNQ1 (n = 29) 
      and KCNH2 (n = 6) genes. The control group consisted of 35 age- and gender-matched 
      healthy children. The mean age was 7 years in the LQTS group and 6.7 years in the 
      control group (range, 0.5-16 years). The corrected Q-T interval (QT(c)) was measured 
      manually (QT(man)) by one author (A.W.). The 12-lead ECG automatic measurements 
      (QT(ECG)) and interpretation (QT(Interpret)) of QT(c) were performed with the 
      Mac5000 (GE Medical System), and the VCG automatic measurements (QT(VCG)) were 
      performed with the Mida1000, CoroNet (Ortivus AB, Sweden). By either method, a QT(c) 
      longer than 440 ms was considered prolonged and indicative of LQTS. Of the 35 
      children with genetically confirmed LQTS, 30 (86 %) received a correct diagnosis 
      using QT(VCG), 29 (82 %) using QT(man), 24 (69 %) using QT(ECG), and 17 (49 %) using 
      QT(Interpret). Specificity was 0.80 for QT(VCG), 0.83 for QT(man), 0.77 for QT(ECG), 
      and 0.83 for QT(Interpret). The VCG automatic measurement of QT(c) seems to be a 
      better predictor of LQTS than automatic measurement and interpretation of 12-lead 
      ECG.

TI  - Spatiotemporal representation of cardiac vectorcardiogram (VCG) signals.
PG  - 16
LID - 10.1186/1475-925X-11-16 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vectorcardiogram (VCG) signals monitor both spatial and temporal cardiac 
      electrical activities along three orthogonal planes of the body. However, the 
      absence of spatiotemporal resolution in conventional VCG representations is a major 
      impediment for medical interpretation and clinical usage of VCG. This is especially 
      so because time-domain features of 12-lead ECG, instead of both spatial and temporal 
      characteristics of VCG, are widely used for the automatic assessment of cardiac 
      pathological patterns. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We present a novel representation 
      approach that captures critical spatiotemporal heart dynamics by displaying the real 
      time motion of VCG cardiac vectors in a 3D space. Such a dynamic display can also be 
      realized with only one lead ECG signal (e.g., ambulatory ECG) through an alternative 
      lag-reconstructed ECG representation from nonlinear dynamics principles. 
      Furthermore, the trajectories are color coded with additional dynamical properties 
      of space-time VCG signals, e.g., the curvature, speed, octant and phase angles to 
      enhance the information visibility. RESULTS: In this investigation, spatiotemporal 
      VCG signal representation is used to characterize various spatiotemporal 
      pathological patterns for healthy control (HC), myocardial infarction (MI), atrial 
      fibrillation (AF) and bundle branch block (BBB). The proposed color coding scheme 
      revealed that the spatial locations of the peak of T waves are in the Octant 6 for 
      the majority (i.e., 74 out of 80) of healthy recordings in the PhysioNet PTB 
      database. In contrast, the peak of T waves from 31.79% (117/368) of MI subjects are 
      found to remain in Octant 6 and the rest (68.21%) spread over all other octants. The 
      spatiotemporal VCG signal representation is shown to capture the same important 
      heart characteristics as the 12-lead ECG plots and more. CONCLUSIONS: Spatiotemporal 
      VCG signal representation is shown to facilitate the characterization of space-time 
      cardiac pathological patterns and enhance the automatic assessment of cardiovascular 
      diseases.

TI  - Rapid ventricular pacing for clip reconstruction of complex unruptured intracranial 
      aneurysms: results of an interdisciplinary prospective trial.

AB  - OBJECTIVE To date, treatment of complex unruptured intracranial aneurysms (UIAs) 
      remains challenging. Therefore, advanced techniques are required to achieve an 
      optimal result in treating these patients safely. In this study, the safety and 
      efficacy of rapid ventricular pacing (RVP) to facilitate microsurgical clip 
      reconstruction was investigated prospectively in a joined neurosurgery, 
      anesthesiology, and cardiology study. METHODS Patients with complex UIAs were 
      prospectively enrolled. Both the safety and efficacy of RVP were evaluated by 
      recording cardiovascular events and outcomes of patients as well as the amount of 
      aneurysm occlusion after the surgical clip reconstruction procedure. A questionnaire 
      was used to evaluate aneurysm preparation and clip application under RVP. RESULTS 
      Twenty patients (mean age 51.6 years, range 28-66 years) were included in this 
      study. Electrode positioning was easy in 19 (95%) of 20 patients, and removal of 
      electrodes was easily accomplished in all patients (100%). No complications 
      associated with the placement of the pacing electrodes occurred, such as cardiac 
      perforation or cardiac tamponade. RVP was applied in 16 patients. The mean aneurysm 
      size was 11.1 ± 5.5 mm (range 6-30 mm). RVP proved to be a very helpful tool in 
      aneurysm preparation and clip application in 15 (94%) of 16 patients. RVP was used 
      for a mean duration of 60 ± 25 seconds, a mean heart rate of 173 ± 23 bpm (range 
      150-210 bpm), and a reduction of mean arterial pressure to 35-55 mm Hg. RVP leads to 
      softening of the aneurysm sac facilitating its mobilization, clip application, and 
      closure of the clip blades. In 2 patients, cardiac events were documented that 
      resolved without permanent sequelae in both. In every patient with successful RVP (n 
      = 14) a total or near-total aneurysm occlusion was documented. In the 1 patient in 
      whom the second RVP failed due to pacemaker electrode dislocation, additional 
      temporary clipping was required to secure the aneurysm, but was not as sufficient as 
      RVP. This led to an incomplete clipping of the aneurysm and finally a remnant on 
      postoperative digital subtraction angiography. A pacemaker lead dislocation occurred 
      in 3 (19%) of 16 patients, but intraoperative repositioning requires less than 20 
      seconds. Outcome was favorable in all patients according to the modified Rankin 
      Scale. CONCLUSIONS To the best of the authors' knowledge this is the first 
      prospective interdisciplinary study of RVP use in patients with UIAs. RVP is an 
      elegant technique that facilitates clip reconstruction in complex UIAs. The safety 
      of the procedure is good. However, because this procedure requires extensive 
      preoperative cardiological workup of the patient and an experienced neurosurgery and 
      neuroanesthesiology team with much cerebrovascular expertise, actually it remains 
      reserved for selected elective cases and highly specialized centers. Clinical trial 
      registration no.: NCT02766972 (clinicaltrials.gov).

PG  - 5610-5513
LID - 10.1109/EMBC.2018.8513634 [doi]
AB  - The gold standard method to monitor heart rate variability (HRV) comprises measuring 
      the time series of interbeat interval durations from electrocardiographic (ECG) 
      recordings. However, due to the widespread use, simplicity and usability of 
      photoplethysmographic (PPG) techniques, monitoring pulse rate variability (PRV) from 
      pulse wave recordings has become a viable alternative to standard HRV analysis. The 
      present study investigates the accuracy of PRV, measured as a surrogate of HRV, for 
      the quantification of descriptive indexes computed in the time domain (mean, 
      variance), frequency domain (low-to-high frequency power ratio LF/HF, HF band 
      central frequency) and information domain (entropy, conditional entropy). We analyze 
      short time series (300 intervals) of HRV measured from the ECG and of PRV acquired 
      from Finometer device in 76 subjects monitored in the resting supine position (SU) 
      and in the upright position during head-up tilt (HUT). Time, frequency and 
      information domain indexes are computed for each HRV and PRV series and, for each 
      index, the comparison between the two approaches is performed through statistical 
      comparison of the distributions across subjects, robust linear regression, and 
      Bland-Altman plots. Results of the comparison indicate an overall good agreement 
      between PRV-based and HRV-based indexes, with an accuracy that is slightly lower 
      during HUT than during SU, and for the band-power ratio and conditional entropy. 
      These results suggest the feasibility of PRV-based assessment of HRV descriptive 
      indexes, and suggest to further investigate the agreement in conditions of 
      physiological stress.

AB  - The management of intensive care patients with implanted devices requires the 
      knowledge of the type of device (e.g. pacemaker, defibrillator, device for cardiac 
      contractility modulation or event recorder). An electrocardiogram (ECG) and 
      chest-X-ray can be helpful for identification of the type and manufacturer of the 
      device. Information concerning the programmed parameters can be obtained by device 
      interrogation. The establishment of invasive monitoring can be complicated by the 
      intracardiac electrodes of the devices and requires a careful selection of the 
      venous access site. In cases of external cardioversion/defibrillation there are some 
      specific considerations to be made to avoid damage of the implanted device. Finally, 
      adaption of device programming to the special circumstances in the intensive care 
      unit may help patient and physician.

AB  - A 40-year-old male struck his chest against a pole during a basketball game and had 
      sudden out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. After bystander cardiopulmonary 
      resuscitation, fire and emergency medical services personnel provided six 
      defibrillation attempts prior to emergency department arrival. A 7th attempt in the 
      emergency department using a different vector was unsuccessful. On the 8th attempt, 
      using a second defibrillator with defibrillator pads placed adjacent to the primary 
      set of defibrillator pads, two shocks were administered in near simultaneous 
      fashion. The double sequential defibrillation was successful and the patient had 
      return of spontaneous circulation at the next pulse check. He recovered in the 
      intensive care unit, was discharged home 1 month later, and continues to follow up 
      in clinic over 1 year later with a Cerebral Performance Category score of 1 
      (short-term memory deficits).

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study sought to investigate the differences in detecting (e.g., 
      triggering) periprocedural myocardial infarction (PMI) among 3 current definitions. 
      BACKGROUND: PMI is a frequent component of primary endpoints in coronary device 
      trials. Identification of all potential suspected events is critical for accurate 
      event ascertainment. Automatic triggers based on study databases prevent 
      underreporting of events. METHODS: We generated automated algorithms to trigger PMI 
      based on each definition and compared results using data from the RESOLUTE all 
      comers trial. RESULTS: The operationalization of current PMI definitions was 
      achieved by defining programmable algorithms used to interrogate the study database. 
      From a total of 636 PMI triggers, we identified 234 for the World Health 
      Organization extended definition, 382 for the Third Universal definition, and 216 
      for the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions definition. 
      Differences among the biomarkers used, different cutoff values, and in the hierarchy 
      among biomarkers within definitions, yielded a different number of triggers, and 
      identified unique triggers for each definition. Only 38 triggers were consistently 
      identified by all definitions. Availability of ECG data, eCRF data on clinical 
      presentation, and the reporting of >2 post-procedural values of the same biomarker 
      influenced considerably the number of PMI triggers identified. CONCLUSIONS: PMI 
      definitions are not interchangeable. The number of triggers identified and 
      consequently the potential number of events varies significantly, highlighting the 
      importance of rigorous methodology when PMI is a component of a powered endpoint. 
      Emphasis on collection of biomarkers, ECG data, and clinical status at baseline may 
      improve the correct identification of PMI triggers.

AB  - This paper is concerned with the automatic control of drug administration in 
      patients suffering from Brugada Syndrome (BS). Drugs such as flecainide, 
      procainamide, ajmaline and pilsicainide should be administrated under carefully 
      controlled electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring given that the treatment must be 
      stopped if some ECG disturbing conditions appear. These conditions are, among others 
      the development of premature ventricular contraction (PVC), atrial fibrillation (AF) 
      and the widening of the QRS wave. The proposed system can detect these abnormalities 
      by using a pattern recognition approach based on Hidden Markov Models (HMM) with 
      features extracted from three scales of the Wavelet Transform (WT). Performances 
      higher than 98% were reached regarding the classification of normal and abnormal 
      pulses. The system was trained and tested mainly in data from the standard MIT-BIH 
      arrhythmia database.

TI  - Multi-modal ECG Holter system for sleep-disordered breathing screening: a validation 
      study.
PG  - 685-93
LID - 10.1007/s11325-011-0558-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The high prevalence of sleep disordered breathing (SDB) among heart 
      diseases patients becomes increasingly recognized. A reliable exploring tool of SDB 
      well adapted to cardiologists practice would be very useful for the management of 
      these patients. METHODS: We assessed a novel multi-modal electrocardiogram (ECG) 
      Holter which incorporated both thoracic impedance and pulse oximetry signals. We 
      compared in a home setting, a standard condition for Holter recordings, results from 
      the novel device to a classical ambulatory polygraph in subjects with suspected SDB. 
      The analysis of cardiac arrhythmias in relationship with SDB is also presented. A 
      total of 118 patients clinically suspected of having SDB were evaluated (mean age 57 
      ± 14 years, mean body mass index [BMI] 32 ± 6 kg/m(2)). The new device allows 
      calculating a new index called thoracic impedance (TI) disturbance index (TIDI+) 
      evaluated from TI and SpO(2) signals recorded from a Holter monitor. RESULTS: In the 
      population under study, 93% had more than 70% of usable TI signal and 95% had more 
      than 90% for SpO(2) during sleep time recording. Screening performance results based 
      on automatic analysis is accurate: TIDI + demonstrates a high level of sensitivity 
      (96.8%), specificity (72.3%) as well as positive (82.4%) and negative (94.4%) 
      predictive value for the detection of SDB. Moreover, detection of SDB periods 
      permits us to observe a possible respiratory association of several nocturnal 
      arrhythmias. CONCLUSIONS: The multi-modal Holter should be considered as a valuable 
      evaluating tool for SDB screening and as a case selection technique for facilitating 
      access to a full polysomnography for severe cases. Moreover, it offers a unique 
      opportunity to study arrhythmia consequences with both respiratory and hypoxia 
      disturbances.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To adapt to a new environment or situation, biological systems explore 
      the most convenient state while moving between attractors by the force of random 
      fluctuation. From this concept, the random component in physiological signals is 
      assumed to increase during developmental and degenerative stages of life. To examine 
      this hypothesis, we measured the age-dependent changes in the random component of 
      heart rate variability (HRV) in 24-h electrocardiography (ECG) big data and in 
      patients with a developmental disorder (DD). APPROACH: We measured separately 
      regulated and random components of HRV with autoregressive (AR) model fitting, by 
      which the ratio of random component as the fractional variance of AR residual time 
      series. From the ALLSTAR database of about 304 000 ambulatory 24-h ECGs, we randomly 
      extracted the data of 1930 men and 1987 women uniformly for all ages from 0 to 100 
      years old (100 cases per 5-year strata for each sex). Data were also obtained from 
      male pediatric patients with DD (age 10-15 years). MAIN RESULTS: While the variance 
      of the regulated component of HRV increased from age 0 to 20, decreased with age 
      until 40, and reached a plateau in both sexes, the ratio of the random component was 
      high at birth, decreased with age until 35 in men and 30 in women, and increased 
      again after 75 in men and 85 in women (P  <  0.0001 for all). In patients with a DD, 
      the ratio of the random component was significantly lower than that in age-and-sex 
      matched subjects in the database. SIGNIFICANCE: We found that the ratio of the 
      random component of HRV is increased during developmental and degenerative stages of 
      life and that it may be reduced in DD patients during their development.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) is an important indicator of 
      the functionality of the arterial baroreceptors, and its assessment may have major 
      research and clinical implications. An important requirement for its quantification 
      is the continuous recording of electrocardiography (ECG) signal, so as to extract 
      the RR interval, in parallel with continuous beat-to-beat blood pressure recording. 
      We aimed to accurately calculate the RR Interval from pressure wave recordings per 
      se, namely, the Pulse Interval (PI) using various arterial pulse wave analysis 
      algorithms and to evaluate the precision and accuracy of BRS values calculated with 
      the PI compared to BRS values calculated with the RR Interval. METHODS: We analyzed 
      the open access data of the Eurobavar study, which contains a set of ECG and 
      arterial blood pressure (BP) wave signals recorded at 11 European centers. Pressure 
      waveforms were continuously recorded by the Finapres apparatus which uses a finger 
      cuff. The cuff pressure around the finger is dynamically adjusted by a servo-system 
      to equal intra-arterial pressure, thus allowing the continuous recording of 
      beat-to-beat BP waves. RR Interval was calculated from the ECG, whereas, PI was 
      extracted from the arterial pulse waveforms, using 4 different methods (minimum, 
      maximum, maximum 1st derivative and intersecting tangents method). BRS values were 
      estimated by time domain and frequency domain methods. In order to compare 
      agreement, accuracy, precision, variability, and the association between the 
      reference BRS using the RR Interval and the BRS values using PI, standard 
      statistical methods (i.e. intraclass correlation coefficients, RMSE, regression 
      analysis) and Bland-Altman methods were performed. RESULTS: We found that analysis 
      of pressure waves alone by frequency-based (i.e. spectral) methods, provides the 
      most accurate results of BRS estimation compared to time-domain methods (ICC > 0.9, 
      R > 0.9, RMSE > 0.8 ms/mmHg). Concerning the spectral method, any algorithm for PI 
      calculation is sufficient, as all show excellent agreement with the respective 
      RR-intervals determined by ECG time series. Only the intersecting tangents and the 
      maximum 1st derivative methods for PI calculation produce the most accurate results 
      in time domain BRS estimation. CONCLUSION: BRS estimation by proper analysis of 
      pressure wave signals alone is feasible and accurate. Further studies are needed to 
      investigate the clinical validity and relevance of the different BRS estimations in 
      diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic levels.

AB  - The heart sound signal is a reflection of heart and vascular system motion. 
      Long-term continuous electrocardiogram (ECG) contains important information which 
      can be helpful to prevent heart failure. A single piece of a long-term ECG recording 
      usually consists of more than one hundred thousand data points in length, making it 
      difficult to derive hidden features that may be reflected through dynamic ECG 
      monitoring, which is also very time-consuming to analyze. In this paper, a Dynamic 
      Time Warping based on MapReduce (MRDTW) is proposed to make prognoses of possible 
      lesions in patients. Through comparison of a real-time ECG of a patient with the 
      reference sets of normal and problematic cardiac waveforms, the experimental results 
      reveal that our approach not only retains high accuracy, but also greatly improves 
      the efficiency of the similarity measure in dynamic ECG series.

TI  - Risk detection in patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome based on 
      cardiovascular time series analysis().
PG  - 6794-6797
LID - 10.1109/EMBC.2019.8856472 [doi]
AB  - Obstructive sleep apnea represents the most common form of sleep-disordered 
      breathing and has a high prevalence in patients with cardiovascular disease. 
      Disturbed sleep is a potential risk factor for cardiovascular disorders such as 
      arterial hypertension, cardiac ischemia, sudden cardiac death, and stroke. In this 
      study we investigated polysomnographic records and analyzed the ECG, plethysmogram, 
      respiration and SpO2 time series during wakefulness (WK), NREM, and REM sleep stages 
      applying variability and coupling analyses methods. We enrolled 55 patients with 
      obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) and 29 healthy control subjects (CON: 
      45.9±14.9 years, 21 male) in this study. OSAS patients were subdivided into a low- 
      and high-risk group (LR: 50.8±14.1 years, n=29, 21 male; HR: 57.2±13.4 years, n=26, 
      19 male) based on the Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI) (CON: 0-5 AHI, LR: 5-15 AHI, HR: 
      >15 AHI). We could demonstrate the presence of an altered autonomic function in OSAS 
      patients, differing from healthy controls. This altered autonomic function was 
      mainly based on heart rate-, respiratory-, SpO2- and plethysmogram variability and 
      their couplings. The discriminant analysis showed that the optimal set consisting of 
      two autonomic indices revealed a high classification power (ACC=86.7%, AUC=90.3%, 
      SENS=89.5% and SPEC=84.6%) when comparing low-risk and high-risk OSAS patients 
      during WK. These results were slightly improved when analyzing REM sleep stages. 
      Based on these results it seems to be possible to perform optimal risk 
      stratification for OSAS patients based on autonomic indices. Based on our findings 
      it is possible to differentiate between high-risk OSAS patient and low-risk OSAS 
      patient at an early stage and in a promising manner allowing to set up therapy 
      strategies for those patients in an early stage.

TI  - Miniaturized implantable cardiac monitor with a long sensing vector (BIOMONITOR 
      III): Insertion procedure assessment, sensing performance, and home monitoring 
      transmission success.

LID - S0022-0736(20)30107-2 [pii]

AB  - BACKGROUND: Implantable Cardiac Monitors (ICMs) are used for long-term monitoring of 
      arrhythmias. BIOMONITOR III is a novel ICM with a miniaturized profile, long sensing 
      vector due to a flexible antenna, simplified implantation with a dedicated insertion 
      tool for pocket formation and ICM placement in a single step, and daily automatic 
      Home Monitoring (HM) function. METHODS: In 47 patients undergoing BIOMONITOR III 
      insertion for any ICM indication, 16 investigators at 10 Australian sites assessed 
      handling characteristics of the insertion tool, R-wave amplitudes, noise burden, 
      P-wave visibility, and HM transmission success. Patients were followed for 1 month. 
      RESULTS: All 47 attempted insertions were successful. Median time from skin incision 
      to removal of the insertion tool after ICM insertion was 39 s (IQR 19-65) and to 
      wound closure and cleaning was 4.7 min (IQR 3.5-7.8). All aspects of the insertion 
      tool were rated as "good" or "excellent" in ≥97.9% and "fair" in ≤2.1% of patients, 
      except for "force needed for tunnelling" (91.5% good/excellent, 8.5% fair). Based on 
      HM data, R-waves in the first month were stable at 0.70 ± 0.37 mV. Median noise 
      burden (disabling automatic rhythm evaluation) was 0.19% (IQR 0.00-0.93), equivalent 
      to 2.7 min (IQR 0.0-13.4) per day. In HM-transmitted ECG strips with regular sinus 
      rhythm, P-waves were visible in 89 ± 24% of heart cycles. Patient-individual 
      automatic Home Monitoring transmission success was 98.0% ± 5.5%. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      novel ICM performed well in all aspects studied, including fast insertion, reliable 
      R-wave sensing, good P-wave visibility, and highly successful HM transmissions.

TI  - A physiology based model of heart rate variability.
PG  - 425-434
LID - 10.1007/s13534-019-00124-w [doi]
AB  - Heart rate variability (HRV) is governed by the autonomic nervous system (ANS) and 
      is routinely used to estimate the state of body and mind. At the same time, recorded 
      HRV features can vary substantially between people. A model for HRV that 
      (1) correctly simulates observed HRV, (2) reliably functions for multiple scenarios, 
      and (3) can be personalised using a manageable set of parameters, would be a 
      significant step forward toward understanding individual responses to external 
      influences, such as physical and physiological stress. Current HRV models attempt to 
      reproduce HRV characteristics by mimicking the statistical properties of measured 
      HRV signals. The model presented here for the simulation of HRV follows a radically 
      different approach, as it is based on an approximation of the physiology behind the 
      triggering of a heart beat and the biophysics mechanisms of how the triggering 
      process-and thereby the HRV-is governed by the ANS. The model takes into account the 
      metabolisation rates of neurotransmitters and the change in membrane potential 
      depending on transmitter and ion concentrations. It produces an HRV time series that 
      not only exhibits the features observed in real data, but also explains a reduction 
      of low frequency band-power for physically or psychologically high intensity 
      scenarios. Furthermore, the proposed model enables the personalisation of input 
      parameters to the physiology of different people, a unique feature not present in 
      existing methods. All these aspects are crucial for the understanding and 
      application of future wearable health.

TI  - Fetal motion estimation from noninvasive cardiac signal recordings.
PG  - 2003-2023
AB  - Fetal motility is a widely accepted indicator of the well-being of a fetus. In 
      previous research, it has be shown that fetal motion (FM) is coherent with fetal 
      heart rate accelerations and an indicator for active/rest cycles of the fetus. The 
      most common approach for FM and fetal heart rate (FHR) assessment is by Doppler 
      ultrasound (DUS). While DUS is the most common approach for studying the mechanical 
      activities of the heart, noninvasive fetal electrocardiogram (ECG) and 
      magnetocardiogram (MCG) recording and processing techniques have been considered as 
      a possible competitor (or complement) for the DUS. In this study, a fully automatic 
      and robust framework is proposed for the extraction, ranking and alignment of fetal 
      QRS-complexes from noninvasive fetal ECG/MCG. Using notions from subspace tracking, 
      two measures, namely the actogram and rotatogram, are defined for fetal motion 
      tracking. The method is applied to four fetal ECG/MCG databases, including twin MCG 
      recordings. By defining a novel measure of causality, it is shown that there is 
      significant coherency and causal relationship between the actogram/rotatogram and 
      FHR accelerations/decelerations. Using this measure, it is shown that in many cases, 
      the actogram and rotatogram precede the FHR variations, which supports the idea of 
      motion-induced FHR accelerations/decelerations for these cases and raises attention 
      for the non-motion-induced FHR variations, which can be associated to the fetal 
      central nervous system developments. The results of this study can lead to novel 
      perspectives of the fetal sympathetic and parasympathetic brain systems and future 
      requirements of fetal cardiac monitoring.

TI  - Detection of Myocardial Infarction from Multi-lead ECG using Dual-Q Tunable Q-Factor 
      Wavelet Transform.
PG  - 1496-1499

AB  - Electrocardiography (ECG) signal analysis is an effective method for diagnosis of 
      heart disease. However, the quality of ECG, corrupted by artifacts, limits the 
      automatic ECG classification. In order to extract good quality ECG, we proposed a 
      new ECG enhancement method based on tunable Q-factor wavelet transform (TQWT). In 
      the proposed method, the original ECG signal was decomposed into high Q-factor 
      component and low Q-factor component with dual-Q TQWT. According to the 
      morphological of P, QRS, T waves in ECG, low Q-factor component was chosen for the 
      representation of ECG. The proposed method was tested on 52 healthy volunteers and 
      52 myocardial infarction patients from the openly dataset of PTB diagnostic ECG. A 
      total of 288 features, covering time, frequency, nonlinear, and entropy domains, 
      were extracted from R-R interval and ECG (in a window of 5s) across 12 leads. The 
      features were selected by Relief method, and 22 discriminative features were fed 
      into five different classifiers. The classification accuracy for dual-Q TQWT was 
      86.3%, which was 4.7% higher than the filtered data based on k-nearest neighbors 
      (KNN) algorithm. The comparison results verified that the proposed dual-Q TQWT 
      method provides good feasibility for ECG de-noising.

AB  - Electrocardiogram (ECG) is gaining increased attention as a biometric method in a 
      wide range of applications, such as access control and security/privacy 
      requirements. The majority of reported investigations using the ECG biometric method 
      are usually based on fiducial or nonfiducial methods, which are always accompanied 
      by a series of issues, such as locating fiducial points accurately is difficult, 
      feature selection is subjective, and classifiers are limited by the quantity and 
      structure of data. This paper proposes a new biometric authentication system for 
      human identification that uses ECG signals as a biometric trait and integrates a 
      generalized S-transformation and a convolutional neural network (CNN). Specifically, 
      we first introduce a blind segmentation strategy that effectively avoids difficult 
      data-specific heartbeat recognition and segmentation techniques. Then, a generalized 
      S-transformation is performed on the blind signal-processed ECG signal, capturing 
      the ECG trajectory at each time point in the frequency domain. Next, the getframe 
      technology is used to capture an image of the ECG trajectories and convert the 
      one-dimensional signal to a two-dimensional image, which serves as the input layer 
      of the CNN, thus fully reflecting the changing trend in the ECG signal spectrum 
      characteristics over a continuous period. Finally, the CNN is used for automatic 
      discriminative feature learning and representations, which avoids a tedious feature 
      extraction algorithm. In addition, considering the possible impact of ECG signals 
      with different signal behaviors on identification, experiments are performed on 
      three ECG databases with diverse features, comprising normal individuals, atrial 
      fibrillation patients, and a noisy database, to evaluate the effectiveness of the 
      proposed algorithm. Promising identification rates of 99%, 98%, and 99% were 
      achieved, respectively. Thus, our proposed ECG authentication system can be 
      effectively used for identity recognition under various conditions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Acquired long QT syndrome is a reversible condition that can lead to 
      torsades de pointes and sudden cardiac death. OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequency, 
      onset, frequency of medications, and risk factors for the syndrome in intensive care 
      patients. METHODS: In a retrospective chart review of 88 subjects, hourly corrected 
      QT intervals calculated by using the Bazett formula were collected. Acquired long QT 
      syndrome was defined as a corrected QT of 500 milliseconds or longer or an increase 
      in corrected QT of 60 milliseconds or greater from baseline level. Risk factors and 
      medications administered were collected from patients' medical records. RESULTS: The 
      syndrome occurred in 46 patients (52%); mean time of onset was 7.4 hours (SD, 9.4) 
      from time of admission. Among the 88 patients, 52 (59%) received a known 
      QTc-prolonging medication. Among the 46 with the syndrome, 23 (50%) received a known 
      QT-prolonging medication. No other risk factor studied was significantly predictive 
      of the syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: Acquired long QT syndrome occurs in patients not 
      treated with a known QT-prolonging medication, indicating the importance of frequent 
      QT monitoring of all intensive care patients.

AB  - There is a growing body of research focusing on automatic detection of ischemia and 
      myocardial infarction (MI) using computer algorithms. In clinical settings, ischemia 
      and MI are diagnosed using electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings as well as medical 
      context including patient symptoms, medical history, and risk factors-information 
      that is often stored in the electronic health records. The ECG signal is inspected 
      to identify changes in the morphology such as ST-segment deviation and T-wave 
      changes. Some of the proposed methods compute similar features automatically while 
      others use nonconventional features such as wavelet coefficients. This review 
      provides an overview of the methods that have been proposed in this area, focusing 
      on their historical evolution, the publicly available datasets that they have used 
      to evaluate their performance, and the details of their algorithms for ECG and EHR 
      analysis. The validation strategies that have been used to evaluate the performance 
      of the proposed methods are also presented. Finally, the paper provides 
      recommendations for future research to address the shortcomings of the currently 
      existing methods and practical considerations to make the proposed technical 
      solutions applicable in clinical practice.

TI  - Towards development of alert thresholds for clinical deterioration using continuous 
      predictive analytics monitoring.
LID - 10.1007/s10877-019-00361-5 [doi]
AB  - Patients who deteriorate while on the acute care ward and are emergently transferred 
      to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) experience high rates of mortality. To date, risk 
      scores for clinical deterioration applied to the acute care wards rely on static or 
      intermittent inputs of vital sign and assessment parameters. We propose the use of 
      continuous predictive analytics monitoring, or data that relies on real-time 
      physiologic monitoring data captured from ECG, documented vital signs, laboratory 
      results, and other clinical assessments to predict clinical deterioration. A 
      necessary step in translation to practice is understanding how an alert threshold 
      would perform if applied to a continuous predictive analytic that was trained to 
      detect clinical deterioration. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the 
      positive predictive value of 'risk spikes', or large abrupt increases in the output 
      of a statistical model of risk predicting clinical deterioration. We studied 8111 
      consecutive patient admissions to a cardiovascular medicine and surgery ward with 
      continuous ECG data. We first trained a multivariable logistic regression model for 
      emergent ICU transfer in a test set and tested the characteristics of the model in a 
      validation set of 4059 patient admissions. Then, in a nested analysis we identified 
      large, abrupt spikes in risk (increase by three units over the prior 6 h; a unit is 
      the fold-increase in risk of ICU transfer in the next 24 h) and reviewed hospital 
      records of 91 patients for clinical events such as emergent ICU transfer. We 
      compared results to 59 control patients at times when they were matched for baseline 
      risk including the National Warning Score (NEWS). There was a 3.4-fold higher event 
      rate for patients with risk spikes (positive predictive value 24% compared to 7%, 
      p = 0.006). If we were to use risk spikes as an alert, they would fire about once 
      per day on a 73-bed acute care ward. Risk spikes that were primarily driven by 
      respiratory changes (ECG-derived respiration (EDR) or charted respiratory rate) had 
      highest PPV (30-35%) while risk spikes driven by heart rate had the lowest (7%). 
      Alert thresholds derived from continuous predictive analytics monitoring are able to 
      be operationalized as a degree of change from the person's own baseline rather than 
      arbitrary threshold cut-points, which can likely better account for the individual's 
      own inherent acuity levels. Point of care clinicians in the acute care ward settings 
      need tailored alert strategies that promote a balance in recognition of clinical 
      deterioration and assessment of the utility of the alert approach.

AB  - Heart rate variability (HRV) is a promising marker for evaluating the remaining 
      autonomic function in people with spinal cord injury (SCI). HRV is commonly assessed 
      by spectral analysis and detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA). This study aimed to 
      investigate whether local scale exponent α(t) can reveal new features of HRV that 
      cannot be reflected by spectral measures and DFA coefficients. We studied 12 
      participants with SCI and 15 healthy able-bodied controls. ECG signals were 
      continually recorded during 10 min sitting and 10 min prone postures. α(t) was 
      calculated for scales between 4 and 60 s. Because α(t) could be overestimated at 
      small scales, we developed an approach for correcting α(t) based on previous 
      studies. The simulation results on simulated monofractal time series with α between 
      0.5 and 1.3 showed that the proposed method can yield improved estimation of α(t). 
      We applied the proposed method to raw RR interval series. The results showed that 
      α(t) in healthy controls monotonically decreased with scale at scales between 4 and 
      12 s (0.083-0.25 Hz) in both the sitting and prone postures, whereas in participants 
      with SCI, α(t) slowly decreased at almost all scales. The sharp decreasing trend in 
      α(t) in controls suggests a more complex dynamics of HRV in controls. α(t) at scales 
      between 4 (0.25 Hz) and around 7 s (0.143 Hz) was lower in subjects with SCI than in 
      controls in the sitting posture; α(t) at a narrow range of scales around 12 s (0.083 
      Hz) was higher in participants with SCI than in controls in the prone posture. 
      However, none of normalized low frequency (0.04-0.15 Hz) power, the ratio of low 
      frequency power to high frequency (0.15-0.4 Hz) power and long-term (>11 beats) DFA 
      coefficient showed significant difference between healthy controls and subjects with 
      SCI in the prone posture. Our results suggest that α(t) can reveal more detailed 
      information in comparison to spectral measures and the standard DFA parameters.

TI  - Refeeding syndrome: multimodal monitoring and clinical manifestation of an internal 
      severe neurotrauma.

AB  - Refeeding syndrome (RFS) is a rare, potentially life-threatening, condition seen in 
      malnourished patients starting refeeding. RFS may provoke seizures and acute 
      encephalopathy and can be considered an internal severe neurotrauma in need of 
      specific treatment. The objective was to describe course of disease, treatment and, 
      for the first time, multimodal monitoring output in a comatose patient suffering 
      RFS. After gastric-banding and severe weight loss, the patient initiated 
      self-starving and was transferred to our intensive care unit (ICU) following rapid 
      refeeding. At arrival, seizures, decrease in consciousness (GCS 7) and suspected 
      acute encephalitis was presented. Serum albumin was 8 g/l. Intracranial pressure 
      (ICP), invasive blood pressure and electrocardiography (ECG) were monitored. 
      Pressure reactivity (PR(x)) and compliance (RAP) were calculated. The patient 
      developed congestive heart failure, anuria and general oedema despite maximal neuro- 
      and general ICU treatment. Global cerebral oedema and hypoperfusion areas with 
      established ischemia were seen. ECG revealed massive cardiac arrhythmia and 
      disturbed autonomic regulation. PR(x) indicated intact autoregulation (-0.06 ± 0.18, 
      mean ± SD) and relatively normal compliance (RAP = 0.23 ± 0.13). After 15 days the 
      clinical state was improved, and the patient returned to the primary hospital. RFS 
      was associated with serious deviations in homeostasis, high ICP levels, ECG 
      abnormalities, kidney and lung affections. It is of utmost importance to recognize 
      this rare syndrome and to treat appropriately. Despite the severe clinical state, 
      cerebral autoregulation and compensatory reserve were generally normal, questioning 
      the applicability of indirect measurements such as PR(x) and RAP during 
      neuro-intensive care treatment of RFS patients with cerebral engagement.

AB  - Although Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) statistic is a widely used method, some weaknesses 
      exist in investigating abrupt Change Point (CP) problems, e.g. it is time-consuming 
      and invalid sometimes. To detect abrupt change from time series fast, a novel method 
      is proposed based on Haar Wavelet (HW) and KS statistic (HWKS). First, the two 
      Binary Search Trees (BSTs), termed TcA and TcD, are constructed by multi-level HW 
      from a diagnosed time series; the framework of HWKS method is implemented by 
      introducing a modified KS statistic and two search rules based on the two BSTs; and 
      then fast CP detection is implemented by two HWKS-based algorithms. Second, the 
      performance of HWKS is evaluated by simulated time series dataset. The simulations 
      show that HWKS is faster, more sensitive and efficient than KS, HW, and T methods. 
      Last, HWKS is applied to analyze the electrocardiogram (ECG) time series, the 
      experiment results show that the proposed method can find abrupt change from ECG 
      segment with maximal data fluctuation more quickly and efficiently, and it is very 
      helpful to inspect and diagnose the different state of health from a patient's ECG 
      signal.

TI  - An Advanced Bio-Inspired PhotoPlethysmoGraphy (PPG) and ECG Pattern Recognition 
      System for Medical Assessment.
LID - 10.3390/s18020405 [doi]
LID - 405
AB  - Physiological signals are widely used to perform medical assessment for monitoring 
      an extensive range of pathologies, usually related to cardio-vascular diseases. 
      Among these, both PhotoPlethysmoGraphy (PPG) and Electrocardiography (ECG) signals 
      are those more employed. PPG signals are an emerging non-invasive measurement 
      technique used to study blood volume pulsations through the detection and analysis 
      of the back-scattered optical radiation coming from the skin. ECG is the process of 
      recording the electrical activity of the heart over a period of time using 
      electrodes placed on the skin. In the present paper we propose a physiological 
      ECG/PPG "combo" pipeline using an innovative bio-inspired nonlinear system based on 
      a reaction-diffusion mathematical model, implemented by means of the Cellular Neural 
      Network (CNN) methodology, to filter PPG signal by assigning a recognition score to 
      the waveforms in the time series. The resulting "clean" PPG signal exempts from 
      distortion and artifacts is used to validate for diagnostic purpose an EGC signal 
      simultaneously detected for a same patient. The multisite combo PPG-ECG system 
      proposed in this work overpasses the limitations of the state of the art in this 
      field providing a reliable system for assessing the above-mentioned physiological 
      parameters and their monitoring over time for robust medical assessment. The 
      proposed system has been validated and the results confirmed the robustness of the 
      proposed approach.

TI  - Automatic Holter electrocardiogram analysis in ischaemic stroke patients to detect 
      paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: ready to replace physicians?
LID - 10.1111/ene.14250 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The detection of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (pAF) in 
      patients presenting with ischaemic stroke shifts secondary stroke prevention to oral 
      anticoagulation. In order to deal with the time- and resource-consuming manual 
      analysis of prolonged electrocardiogram (ECG)-monitoring data, we investigated the 
      effectiveness of pAF detection with an automated algorithm (AA) in comparison to a 
      manual analysis with software support within the IDEAS study [study analysis (SA)]. 
      METHODS: We used the dataset of the prospective IDEAS cohort of patients with acute 
      ischaemic stroke/transient ischaemic attack presenting in sinus rhythm undergoing 
      prolonged 72-h Holter ECG with central adjudication of atrial fibrillation (AF). 
      This adjudicated diagnosis of AF was compared with a commercially available AA. 
      Discordant results with respect to the diagnosis of pAF were resolved by an 
      additional cardiological reference confirmation. RESULTS: Paroxysmal AF was finally 
      diagnosed in 62 patients (5.9%) in the cohort (n = 1043). AA more often diagnosed 
      pAF (n = 60, 5.8%) as compared with SA (n = 47, 4.5%). Due to a high sensitivity 
      (96.8%) and negative predictive value (99.8%), AA was able to identify patients 
      without pAF, whereas abnormal findings in AA required manual review (specificity 
      96%; positive predictive value 60.6%). SA exhibited a lower sensitivity (75.8%) and 
      negative predictive value (98.5%), and showed a specificity and positive predictive 
      value of 100%. Agreement between the two methods classified by kappa coefficient was 
      moderate (0.591). CONCLUSION: Automated determination of 'absence of pAF' could be 
      used to reduce the manual review workload associated with review of prolonged Holter 
      ECG recordings.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: We investigated whether additional electrocardiographic (ECG) metrics 
      not available on current patient monitors could predict bradyasystolic cardiac 
      arrest in hospitalized adult patients. METHODS: A retrospective case-control design 
      was used to study eight ECG metrics from 22 adult bradyasystolic patients and their 
      45 control patients. The eight ECG metrics included heart rate, QRS width, interval 
      from P-wave peak to QRS onset (PRp), heart rate-corrected interval from QRS onset to 
      T-wave peak (QTpc), amplitude of QRS peak (rAmp), amplitude of P-wave (pAmp), 
      amplitude of T-wave (tAmp), and absolute difference in the ECG amplitudes at QRS 
      onset and offset divided by rAmp, that is, relative J-point amplitude (relJAmp). We 
      derived the maximal true-positive rate (TPR) of detecting cardiac arrest at a 
      globally minimal false-positive rate (FPR) for each metric and for the absolute 
      slope values resulted from a linear fitting of the time series of these metrics. We 
      also recorded the first time crossing the detection threshold to the time of arrest 
      as lead time. RESULTS: Conditions of relJAmp >20% and PRp >196.6 ms, respectively, 
      achieved a TPR of 22.7% and 27.3% with zero FPRs. The lead prediction time of these 
      two conditions was 5.7 ± 6.8 hours and 8.0 ± 7.2 hours, respectively. Performance of 
      triggers based on the absolute slope values depended on the window length used for 
      linear fitting. rAmp slope of a 2-hour window, PRp slope of a 30-minute window, and 
      relJAmp slope of a 2-hour window achieved the best TPR of 27.3% (FPR = 2.3%, lead 
      time = 6.5 ± 5.7 hours), 14.3% (FPR=0.0%, lead time = 10.9 ± 10.9), and 18.2% (FPR = 
      2.3%, lead time = 8.8 ± 9.8), respectively. McNemar test showed that only relJAmp 
      >20.0% is significantly different from the baseline trigger of HR >149.3 bpm 
      (p=0.046). In addition, metrics-based and slope-based triggers were complementary as 
      an "OR" combination of two single-metric triggers raised the TPR up to 45.4% with 
      zero FPR. CONCLUSIONS: It is feasible to compute additional metrics from continuous 
      ECG from bedside monitors. These additional parameters can provide highly specific 
      triggers for predicting bradyasystolic cardiac arrest. Complementary triggers based 
      on the slope of trending of these ECG metrics can further increase the sensitivity 
      without incurring false positives.

TI  - Estimation of Sparse VAR Models with Artificial Neural Networks for the Analysis of 
      Biosignals.
PG  - 4623-4627
LID - 10.1109/EMBC.2019.8857403 [doi]
AB  - Vector autoregressive models (VAR models) are often used to model and to analyze 
      multivariate time series, especially to provide short-term forecasts. A common 
      method of estimating coefficients of these VAR models is solving the Yule- Walker 
      equations. This work introduces and investigates a method to set up "sparse" VAR 
      models, in order to obtain a comparable prognosis quality with significantly fewer 
      coefficients. For this purpose, an artificial neural network was programmed in 
      Python with TensorFlow. Sparsity arises from the implementation of regularization 
      algorithms.Based on simulated data and an ECG, we show that a comparable prognosis 
      quality can be achieved with significantly fewer coefficients. In addition, sparse 
      VAR models can also be determined if the data would actually lead to an 
      underdetermined system of equations. Thus, sparse VAR models may help to classify 
      short epochs of biosignals, e.g. P-waves or QRS-complexes.

TI  - An automated ECG-artifact removal method for trunk muscle surface EMG recordings.
PG  - 840-8
LID - 10.1016/j.medengphy.2010.05.007 [doi]
AB  - This study aimed at developing a method for automated electrocardiography (ECG) 
      artifact detection and removal from trunk electromyography signals. Independent 
      Component Analysis (ICA) method was applied to the simulated data set of 
      ECG-corrupted surface electromyography (SEMG) signals. Independent Components (ICs) 
      correspond to ECG artifact were then identified by an automated detection algorithm 
      and subsequently removed. The detection performance of the algorithm was compared to 
      that by visual inspection, while the artifact elimination performance was compared 
      with Butterworth high pass filter at 30 Hz cutoff (BW HPF 30). The automated 
      ECG-artifact detection algorithm successfully recognized the ECG source components 
      in all data sets with a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 99%. Better 
      performance indicated by a significantly higher correlation coefficient (p<0.001) 
      with the original EMG recordings was found in the SEMG data cleaned by the ICA-based 
      method, than that by BW HPF 30. The automated ECG-artifact removal method for trunk 
      SEMG recordings proposed in this study was demonstrated to produce a very good 
      detection rate and preserved essential EMG components while keeping its distortion 
      to minimum. The automatic nature of our method has solved the problem of visual 
      inspection by standard ICA methods and brings great clinical benefits.

TI  - Using ordinal partition transition networks to analyze ECG data.
PG  - 073114
LID - 10.1063/1.4959537 [doi]
AB  - Electrocardiogram (ECG) data from patients with a variety of heart conditions are 
      studied using ordinal pattern partition networks. The ordinal pattern partition 
      networks are formed from the ECG time series by symbolizing the data into ordinal 
      patterns. The ordinal patterns form the nodes of the network and edges are defined 
      through the time ordering of the ordinal patterns in the symbolized time series. A 
      network measure, called the mean degree, is computed from each time series-generated 
      network. In addition, the entropy and number of non-occurring ordinal patterns (NFP) 
      is computed for each series. The distribution of mean degrees, entropies, and NFPs 
      for each heart condition studied is compared. A statistically significant difference 
      between healthy patients and several groups of unhealthy patients with varying heart 
      conditions is found for the distributions of the mean degrees, unlike for any of the 
      distributions of the entropies or NFPs.

TI  - Diagnostic Accuracy Of The Electrocardiographic Decision Support - Myocardial 
      Ischaemia (EDS-MI) Algorithm In Detection Of Acute Coronary Occlusion.
PG  - 13-25
LID - 10.1177/2048872618768081 [doi]
AB  - Electrocardiographic Decision Support - Myocardial Ischaemia (EDS-MI) is a graphical 
      decision support for detection and localization of acute transmural ischaemia. A 
      recent study indicated that EDS-MI performs well for detection of acute transmural 
      ischaemia. However, its performance has not been tested in patients with 
      non-ischaemic ST-deviation. We aimed to optimize the diagnostic accuracy of EDS-MI 
      in patients with verified acute coronary occlusion as well as patients with 
      non-ischaemic ST deviation and compare its performance with STEMI criteria. We 
      studied 135 patients with non-ischaemic ST deviation (perimyocarditis, left 
      ventricular hypertrophy, takotsubo cardiomyopathy and early repolarization) and 117 
      patients with acute coronary occlusion. In 63 ischaemic patients, the extent and 
      location of the ischaemic area (myocardium at risk) was assessed by both 
      cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging and EDS-MI. Sensitivity and specificity of 
      ST elevation myocardial infarction criteria were 85% (95% confidence interval (CI) 
      77, 90) and 44% (95% CI 36, 53) respectively. Using EDS-MI, sensitivity and 
      specificity increased to 92% (95% CI 85, 95) and 81% (95% CI 74, 87) respectively 
      (p=0.035 and p<0.001). Agreement was strong (83%) between cardiovascular magnetic 
      resonance imaging and EDS-MI in localization of ischaemia. Mean myocardium at risk 
      was 32% (± 10) by cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging and 33% (± 11) by EDS-MI 
      when the estimated infarcted area according to Selvester QRS scoring was included in 
      myocardium at risk estimation. In conclusion, EDS-MI increases diagnostic accuracy 
      and may serve as an automatic decision support in the early management of patients 
      with suspected acute coronary syndrome. The added clinical benefit in a non-selected 
      clinical chest pain population needs to be assessed.

TI  - External continuous ECG versus loop recording for atrial fibrillation detection in 
      patients who had a stroke.
PG  - 848-854
LID - 10.1136/heartjnl-2018-314186 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Detection of atrial fibrillation (AF) in patients who had ischaemic 
      stroke and transient ischaemic attack (IS/TIA) is recommended. We aimed to compare 
      external loop recording (ELR) against simultaneous continuous ECG recording for AF 
      detection in patients who had acute IS/TIA and determine sensitivity, specificity 
      and positive predictive value of AF detection using ELR. We hypothesised ELR to 
      detect 15% fewer patients with AF than continuous ECG recording. METHODS: In this 
      prospective cohort study, we included 1412 patients who had acute IS/TIA without 
      prior AF. Monitoring was 48 hours. Primary outcome was AF >30 s. Cardiologist 
      verified AF in continuous ECG was gold standard. RESULTS: In continuous ECG, 38 
      (2.7%) patients had AF. ELR automatically categorised 219/1412 patients (15.5%) with 
      AF, including 32/38 (85%) patients with AF in continuous ECG. After cardiologist 
      adjudication of ELR recordings, AF was diagnosed in 57/219 patients, of which 32 
      (56%) had AF in continuous ECG. For adjudicated AF detection by ELR, sensitivity was 
      84%, 95% CI (69% to 94%), specificity was 98%, 95% CI (97% to 99%) and positive 
      predictive value was 56%, 95% CI (42% to 69%). CONCLUSION: Automatic AF detection 
      with ELR results in an AF diagnosis in more than five patients without AF for each 
      patient with AF as verified in continuous ECG. For adjudicated AF detection by ELR, 
      sensitivity was confirmed to 84% and specificity 98%. Automatic ELR as investigated 
      in this study may be considered to rule out AF, but it is not suitable as a single 
      monitoring device for AF screening in patients early after stroke. TRIAL

AB  - Automatic classification of abnormal beats in ECG signals is crucial for monitoring 
      cardiac conditions and the performance of the classification will improve the 
      success rate of the treatment. However, under certain circumstances, traditional 
      classifiers cannot be adapted well to the variation of ECG morphologies or variation 
      of different patients due to fixed hand-crafted features selection. Additionally, 
      existing deep learning related solutions reach their limitation because they fail to 
      use the beat-to-beat information together with single-beat morphologies. This paper 
      applies a novel solution which converts one-dimensional ECG signal into 
      spectro-temporal images and use multiple dense convolutional neural network to 
      capture both beat-to-beat and single-beat information for analysis. The results of 
      simulation on the MIT-BIH arrhythmias database demonstrate the effectiveness of the 
      proposed methodology by showing an outstanding detection performance compared to 
      other existing methods.

AB  - Atrial fibrillation (Afib) contributes significantly to overall cardiovascular risk. 
      Widespread screening for Afib in primary care is sometimes performed by palpation, 
      but suffers from low accuracy and is dependent on clinician experience. Algorithms 
      implemented on oscillometric blood pressure devices can detect Afib with high 
      sensitivity and specificity, but information on factors affecting accuracy is scant. 
      Concurrent diagnostic electrocardiogram (ECG) and oscillometry were measured in 
      participants in ECG clinics at two sites. Root mean squared successive difference 
      (RMSSD) and irregularity index (Irrx) were calculated from oscillometric data and 
      used to train logistic regression classifiers. Monte Carlo cross validation with 20 
      splits was performed to estimate confidence intervals for mean sensitivity and 
      specificity, with various weightings, in the absence or presence of ectopics, and 
      with or without repeated measurements. 707 measurements, including 168 Afib, were 
      collected from 569 participants with mean (standard deviation) age of 63 (16) years. 
      Sensitivity/specificity of RMSSD and Irrx were 0.982/0.908 and 0.986/0.960 
      respectively when ectopics were included. Excluding ectopics from the data improved 
      specificity by up to 5%. Nevertheless, based on this performance and after 
      accounting for prevalence of Afib in the population aged over 60 years, and 
      estimated costs of healthcare, oscillometric screening for Afib in this age group 
      could return a positive net health-economic benefit.

TI  - Fast T Wave Detection Calibrated by Clinical Knowledge with Annotation of P and T 
      Waves.
PG  - 17693-714
LID - 10.3390/s150717693 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There are limited studies on the automatic detection of T waves in 
      arrhythmic electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. This is perhaps because there is no 
      available arrhythmia dataset with annotated T waves. There is a growing need to 
      develop numerically-efficient algorithms that can accommodate the new trend of 
      battery-driven ECG devices. Moreover, there is also a need to analyze long-term 
      recorded signals in a reliable and time-efficient manner, therefore improving the 
      diagnostic ability of mobile devices and point-of-care technologies. METHODS: Here, 
      the T wave annotation of the well-known MIT-BIH arrhythmia database is discussed and 
      provided. Moreover, a simple fast method for detecting T waves is introduced. A 
      typical T wave detection method has been reduced to a basic approach consisting of 
      two moving averages and dynamic thresholds. The dynamic thresholds were calibrated 
      using four clinically known types of sinus node response to atrial premature 
      depolarization (compensation, reset, interpolation, and reentry). RESULTS: The 
      determination of T wave peaks is performed and the proposed algorithm is evaluated 
      on two well-known databases, the QT and MIT-BIH Arrhythmia databases. The detector 
      obtained a sensitivity of 97.14% and a positive predictivity of 99.29% over the 
      first lead of the validation databases (total of 221,186 beats). CONCLUSIONS: We 
      present a simple yet very reliable T wave detection algorithm that can be 
      potentially implemented on mobile battery-driven devices. In contrast to complex 
      methods, it can be easily implemented in a digital filter design.

TI  - Reducing false asystole alarms in intensive care.
PG  - 2292-2295
LID - 10.1109/EMBC.2017.8037313 [doi]
AB  - High rates of false monitoring alarms in intensive care can desensitize staff and 
      therefore pose a significant risk to patient safety. Like other critical arrhythmia 
      alarms, asystole alarms require immediate attention by the care providers as a true 
      asystole event can be acutely life threatening. Here, it is illustrated that most 
      false asystole alarms can be attributed to poor signal quality, and we propose and 
      evaluate an algorithm to identify data windows of poor signal quality and thereby 
      help suppress false asystole alarms. The algorithm combines intuitive signal-quality 
      features (degree of signal saturation and baseline wander) and information from 
      other physiological signals that might be available. Algorithm training and testing 
      was performed on the MIMIC II and 2015 PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 
      databases, respectively. The algorithm achieved an alarm specificity of 81.0% and 
      sensitivity of 95.4%, missing only one out of 22 true asystole alarms. On a separate 
      neonatal data set, the algorithm was able to reject 89.7% (890 out of 992) of false 
      asystole alarms while keeping all 22 true events. The results show that the false 
      asystole alarm rate can be significantly reduced through basic signal quality 
      evaluation.

TI  - Risk Factors and Outcome of Post Fallot Repair Junctional Ectopic Tachycardia (JET).
PG  - 50-57
LID - 10.1177/2150135118813124 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Junctional ectopic tachycardia (JET) is a common arrhythmia causing 
      hemodynamic impairment following corrective cardiac surgery such as tetralogy of 
      Fallot (TOF) repair. METHODS: We report our experience with postoperative JET 
      following surgical repair of TOF. The retrospective study was done from 2003 to 2012 
      with a total of 105 patients who underwent TOF repair. These patients' clinical and 
      electrocardiographic data (pre-, intra-, and postoperative) were monitored to 
      identify risk factors for the occurrence of JET and to evaluate the outcome of the 
      affected patients. RESULTS: Incidence-Fourteen patients developed JET, with only 
      four patients going directly from sinus rhythm to JET. In all others, either a 
      transient atrioventricular (AV) block or a junctional rhythm preceded JET, mostly 
      intraoperatively, showing a significant relation ( P = .010). Age-Patients with JET 
      were of younger age ( P = .025) and had longer cardiopulmonary bypass ( P = .044) 
      and aortic cross-clamping times ( P = .038). Increased cost and care-The occurrence 
      of JET was associated with a longer stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) and a 
      prolonged need for inotropic support and mechanical ventilation. Time to rate 
      control correlated with length of ICU and hospital stay. MORTALITY: All JET patients 
      converted into sinus rhythm, one of them died shortly after cessation of JET and two 
      patients subsequently developed a first-degree AV block. CONCLUSION: The occurrence 
      of JET remains an important complication during the initial postoperative period by 
      increasing mechanical ventilation time, the need for inotropic support, and 
      prolonging the length of ICU and hospital stay. Risk factors are younger age, longer 
      aortic cross-clamping/bypass times, and intraoperative arrhythmias.

TI  - Image-Based Methods for Phase Estimation, Gating, and Temporal Superresolution of 
      Cardiac Ultrasound.
PG  - 72-79
LID - 10.1109/TBME.2018.2823279 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Ultrasound is an effective tool for rapid noninvasive assessment of 
      cardiac structure and function. Determining the cardiorespiratory phases of each 
      frame in the ultrasound video and capturing the cardiac function at a much higher 
      temporal resolution are essential in many applications. Fulfilling these 
      requirements is particularly challenging in preclinical studies involving small 
      animals with high cardiorespiratory rates, requiring cumbersome and expensive 
      specialized hardware. METHODS: We present a novel method for the retrospective 
      estimation of cardiorespiratory phases directly from the ultrasound videos. It 
      transforms the videos into a univariate time series preserving the evidence of 
      periodic cardiorespiratory motion, decouples the signatures of cardiorespiratory 
      motion with a trend extraction technique, and estimates the cardiorespiratory phases 
      using a Hilbert transform approach. We also present a robust nonparametric 
      regression technique for respiratory gating and a novel kernel-regression model for 
      reconstructing images at any cardiac phase facilitating temporal superresolution. 
      RESULTS: We validated our methods using two-dimensional echocardiography videos and 
      electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings of six mice. Our cardiac phase estimation method 
      provides accurate phase estimates with a mean-phase-error range of 3%-6% against ECG 
      derived phase and outperforms three previously published methods in locating ECGs 
      R-wave peak frames with a mean-frame-error range of 0.73-1.36. Our kernel-regression 
      model accurately reconstructs images at any cardiac phase with a 
      mean-normalized-correlation range of 0.81-0.85 over 50 
      leave-one-out-cross-validation rounds. CONCLUSION AND SIGNIFICANCE: Our methods can 
      enable tracking of cardiorespiratory phases without additional hardware and 
      reconstruction of respiration-free single cardiac-cycle videos at a much higher 
      temporal resolution.

TI  - Suspect carbon dioxide embolism during retroperitoneoscopic adrenalectomy.
PG  - 1478-82
AB  - During a retroperitoneoscopic adrenalectomy in the prone position, a sudden increase 
      in end-Tidal CO2 (EtCO2) (from 42 to 68 mmHg) followed by an abrupt decrease (from 
      68 to 35 mmHg) was observed, concomitantly with a right adrenal vein laceration. 
      Heart rate decreased to 30 bpm, and the systolic blood pressure decreased to 40 
      mmHg. The patient was slightly turned in the left lateral and Trendelenburg position 
      and vasoactive drugs were administered. The systemic blood pressure, EtCO2, CO2 
      elimination (VCO2) and pulse oximetry (SpO2) progressively improved within 10 
      minutes and, at the end of the surgery, the blood pressure recovered from 
      hypotension. ECG returned to normal, with sinusal rhythm and heart rate 
      approximately 70 bpm. The patient was extubated and moved to the Intensive Care Unit 
      (ICU). This case suggests that gas embolisms may occur during retroperitoneoscopic 
      adrenalectomy, and acute changes in EtCO2 should alert the clinicians to these rare 
      but potentially lethal complication. EtCO2 monitoring is essential during 
      laparoscopy, as it may help an early detection of CO2 embolism, characterized by a 
      transient and rapid increase in EtCO2, followed by an abrupt decrease.

TI  - Intensive care nurses' knowledge and practice on endotracheal suctioning of the 
      intubated patient: A quantitative cross-sectional observational study.
PG  - e0201743

LID - e0201743
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Endotracheal suction (ETS) is a common invasive procedure which is 
      done to keep the airways patent by mechanically removing accumulated pulmonary 
      secretions to all in patients with artificial airways. Many life-threatening 
      complications can occur when the procedure is not performed correctly. Although the 
      evidence-based recommendations regarding ETS are available, many of these have not 
      been observed in nurse's clinical practice. We assessed the intensive care nurses' 
      knowledge and practice of ETS to intubated patients in selected hospitals in Dar es 
      Salaam, Tanzania. METHODOLOGY: A descriptive cross-sectional study design involving 
      103 Intensive Care Unit (ICU) nurses in Dar es Salaam city was conducted in 2014. 
      Data were analyzed using SPSS version 20 where descriptive statistics were employed 
      to interpret data. RESULTS: Majority of ICU nurses (69.9%) knew the indication for 
      the procedure, (77.7%) knew the action to be taken in case of abrupt change in the 
      ECG monitor; however, 80.6% demonstrated undesirable overall knowledge on ETS 
      evidence-based recommendations. Nurses with ICU training (57.3%) significantly 
      demonstrated higher knowledge of ETS than non-trained nurses (P<0.005), while all 
      other factors had no influence. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS: Majority of ICU 
      nurses do not have desirable knowledge and skills of ETS, and are currently not 
      following current ETS recommendations. This study has shown that training on ICU 
      skills have positive influence to recommended ETS knowledge. We recommend ICU 
      training, provision of clinical guidelines and adequate support to nurses employed 
      in ICUs. Also, further studies using analytical approach to identify other factors 
      beyond the scope of this study and testing the best approach in fostering adherence 
      to ETS evidence-based recommendations are crucial.

TI  - Ultrasound-guided identification of cardiac imaging windows.
PG  - 3009-18
LID - 10.1118/1.4711757 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Currently, the use of cine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to identify 
      cardiac quiescent periods relative to the electrocardiogram (ECG) signal is 
      insufficient for producing submillimeter-resolution coronary MR angiography (MRA) 
      images. In this work, the authors perform a time series comparison between tissue 
      Doppler echocardiograms of the interventricular septum (IVS) and concurrent biplane 
      x-ray angiograms. Our results indicate very close agreement between the diastasis 
      gating windows identified by both the IVS and x-ray techniques. METHODS: Seven cath 
      lab patients undergoing diagnostic angiograms were simultaneously scanned during a 
      breath hold by ultrasound and biplane x-ray for six to eight heartbeats. The heart 
      rate of each patient was stable. Dye was injected into either the left or 
      right-coronary vasculature. The IVS was imaged using color tissue Doppler in an 
      apical four-chamber view. Diastasis was estimated on the IVS velocity curve. On the 
      biplane angiograms, proximal, mid, and distal regions were identified on the 
      coronary artery (CA). Frame by frame correlation was used to derive displacement, 
      and then velocity, for each region. The quiescent periods for a CA and its 
      subsegments were estimated based on velocity. Using Pearson's correlation 
      coefficient and Bland-Altman analysis, the authors compared the start and end times 
      of the diastasis windows as estimated from the IVS and CA velocities. The authors 
      also estimated the vessel blur across the diastasis windows of multiple sequential 
      heartbeats of each patient. RESULTS: In total, 17 heartbeats were analyzed. The 
      range of heart rate observed across patients was 47-79 beats per minute (bpm) with a 
      mean of 57 bpm. Significant correlations (R > 0.99; p < 0.01) were observed between 
      the IVS and x-ray techniques for the identification of the start and end times of 
      diastasis windows. The mean difference in the starting times between IVS and CA 
      quiescent windows was -12.0 ms. The mean difference in end times between IVS and CA 
      quiescent windows was -3.5 ms. In contrast, the correlation between RR interval and 
      both the start and duration of the x-ray gating windows were relatively weaker: R = 
      0.63 (p = 0.13) and R = 0.86 (p = 0.01). For IVS gating windows, the average 
      estimated vessel blurs during single and multiple heartbeats were 0.5 and 0.66 mm, 
      respectively. For x-ray gating windows, the corresponding values were 0.26 and 0.44 
      mm, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the authors showed that IVS velocity 
      can be used to identify periods of diastasis for coronary arteries. Despite 
      variability in mid-diastolic rest positions over multiple steady rate heartbeats, 
      vessel blurring of 0.5-1 mm was found to be achievable using the IVS gating 
      technique. The authors envision this leading to a new cardiac gating system that, 
      compared with conventional ECG gating, provides better resolution and shorter scan 
      times for coronary MRA.

TI  - A double-blind randomized clinical trial comparing different doses of magnesium in 
      cardioplegic solution for prevention of atrial fibrillation after coronary artery 
      bypass graft surgery.
PG  - 276-82
LID - 10.1111/1755-5922.12198 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: This study aims to compare different doses of magnesium administered via 
      cardioplegic solutions to prevent atrial fibrillation (AF) after coronary artery 
      bypass graft (CABG) surgery. METHODS: A total of 120 patients who were scheduled for 
      elective CABG surgery using cardiopulmonary bypass were enrolled in this 
      double-blind, randomized clinical trial. After fulfilling the inclusion criteria, 
      they were randomly allocated into three groups (A, B, and C). Patients in groups A, 
      B, and C received 60, 80, and 100 mg/kg of magnesium sulfate via cardioplegic 
      solutions during aortic cross-clamp, respectively. Postoperative AF was assessed by 
      continuous ECG monitoring during 3 days after surgery. Also serum magnesium, 
      potassium, and calcium levels were assessed during the study period. RESULTS: The 
      findings revealed significant differences in four point measurements of serum 
      magnesium level after surgery (P<.001). In particular, it was observed that 10 
      (26.3%) patients in group A, 4 (10%) patients in group B, and 2 (5.4%) patients in 
      group C had AF after surgery. This indicates patients receiving magnesium at doses 
      of 80 and 100 mg/kg had lower rates of AF occurrence than those receiving 60 mg/kg 
      dose of magnesium (P=.02). Additionally, no significant difference was found in 
      serum calcium and potassium concentration between the three groups throughout the 
      study period. CONCLUSION: Magnesium administration via the cardioplegic solution 
      during aortic cross-clamping at doses of 80 and 100 mg/kg can reduce the risk of AF 
      occurrence after CABG compared to the dose of 60 mg/kg. Considering the lower rate 
      of AF incidence and shorter length of ICU stay in patients receiving 100 mg/kg of 
      magnesium, it seems reasonable to administer 100 mg/kg magnesium during aortic 
      cross-clamp to prevent postoperative AF.

PG  - 151-158
LID - 10.5603/CJ.a2016.0088 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The theory of chaos proves a deterministic mechanism of induction of 
      multiple complex processes previously thought to be random in nature. This research 
      explains how these complex processes develop. The aim of the study was to test the 
      hypothesis of the chaotic nature of myocardial electrical events during ventricular 
      tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation (VF). METHODS: Original hardware and 
      software was developed for digitalization of on-line electrocardiography (ECG) data, 
      with the functions of automatic and manual identification as well as categoriza-tion 
      of specific ventricular arrhythmias. Patient ECGs were recorded by specially 
      developed measuring equipment (M2TT). Available ECG sampling frequency was 20,000 
      Hz, and it was possible to analyze the signal retrospectively. Digital ECG of the 
      sinus rhythm (SR) was analyzed with non-sustained VT, VT and VF. The signals were 
      then subjected to mathematical analysis. Using wavelet analysis, signals carrying 
      frequencies from various ranges were isolated from baseline and each of these 
      isolated signals was subjected to Fourier transformation to check on differences in 
      the Fourier power spectra of the analyzed VT and VF signals. RESULTS: Ventricular 
      tachycardia identified based on ECG fulfills the criteria of a chaotic process, 
      while no such properties were found for SR and VF. Information obtained by the ECG 
      is used to record myo-cardial electrical signals, but they are not sufficient to 
      differentiate between an advanced chaotic state and the process of linear expansion 
      of electrical activation within the myocardium. CONCLUSIONS: Electrophysiological 
      study requires advanced methods to record the signal of myocardial electrical 
      activity, as ECG is not sufficiently sensitive to identify the features of a chaotic 
      process during VF. (Cardiol J 2017; 24, 2: 151-158).

      hatha yoga - a pilot study.
PG  - 59
LID - 10.1186/1756-0500-6-59 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Yoga exercises are known to decrease stress and restore autonomic 
      balance. Yet knowledge about the physiological effects of inversion postures is 
      limited. This study aimed to investigate the effects of inversion postures (head 
      below the heart) on blood pressure (BP) and heart rate variability (HRV). METHODS: 
      Twelve healthy women and men took part in an 8-week yoga program (60 min once a 
      week). BP was measured with an automatic Omron mx3 oscillometric monitoring device 
      and HRV with a Holter 24-hour ECG at baseline and 8 weeks after the intervention. 
      RESULTS: There was no significant effect of inversion postures on BP. Nine out of 12 
      participants showed a significant increase in HRV (p < 0.05) at night (2 hours) on 
      pNN50% (12.7 ± 12.5 to 18.2 ± 13.3). There were no significant changes in other HRV 
      measures such as NN50, LF, HF, LF/HF ratio, LF normalized units (n.u.), HF n.u. and 
      RMSSD. CONCLUSION: Eight weeks of hatha yoga improved HRV significantly which 
      suggests an increased vagal tone and reduced sympathetic activity.

TI  - Remote vital parameter monitoring in neonatology - robust, unobtrusive heart rate 
      detection in a realistic clinical scenario.

AB  - Vital parameter monitoring of term and preterm infants during incubator care with 
      self-adhesive electrodes or sensors directly positioned on the skin [e.g. 
      photoplethysmography (PPG) for oxygen saturation or electrocardiography (ECG)] is an 
      essential part of daily routine care in neonatal intensive care units. For various 
      reasons, this kind of monitoring contains a lot of stress for the infants. 
      Therefore, there is a need to measure vital parameters (for instance respiration, 
      temperature, pulse, oxygen saturation) without mechanical or conductive contact. As 
      a non-contact method of monitoring, we present an adapted version of camera-based 
      photoplethysmography imaging (PPGI) according to neonatal requirements. Similar to 
      classic PPG, the PPGI camera detects small temporal changes in the term and preterm 
      infant's skin brightness due to the cardiovascular rhythm of dermal blood perfusion. 
      We involved 10 preterm infants in a feasibility study [five males and five females; 
      mean gestational age: 26 weeks (24-28 weeks); mean biological age: 35 days (8-41 
      days); mean weight at the time of investigation: 960 g (670-1290 g)]. The PPGI 
      camera was placed directly above the incubators with the infant inside illuminated 
      by an infrared light emitting diode (LED) array (850 nm). From each preterm infant, 
      5-min video sequences were recorded and analyzed post hoc. As the measurement 
      scenario was kept as realistic as possible, the infants were not constrained in 
      their movements in front of the camera. Movement intensities were assigned into five 
      classes (1: no visible motion to 5: heavy struggling). PPGI was found to be 
      significantly sensitive to movement artifacts. However, for movement classes 1-4, 
      changes in blood perfusion according to the heart rate (HR) were recovered 
      successfully (Pearson correlation: r=0.9759; r=0.765 if class 5 is included). The 
      study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Universal Hospital of the RWTH 
      Aachen University, Aachen, Germany (EK 254/13).

LID - 761536
AB  - Unsupervised mining of electrocardiography (ECG) time series is a crucial task in 
      biomedical applications. To have efficiency of the clustering results, the prominent 
      features extracted from preprocessing analysis on multiple ECG time series need to 
      be investigated. In this paper, a Harmonic Linear Dynamical System is applied to 
      discover vital prominent features via mining the evolving hidden dynamics and 
      correlations in ECG time series. The discovery of the comprehensible and 
      interpretable features of the proposed feature extraction methodology effectively 
      represents the accuracy and the reliability of clustering results. Particularly, the 
      empirical evaluation results of the proposed method demonstrate the improved 
      performance of clustering compared to the previous main stream feature extraction 
      approaches for ECG time series clustering tasks. Furthermore, the experimental 
      results on real-world datasets show scalability with linear computation time to the 
      duration of the time series.

TI  - Accuracy of the Garmin 920 XT HRM to perform HRV analysis.
PG  - 831-839
LID - 10.1007/s13246-017-0593-8 [doi]
AB  - Heart rate variability (HRV) analysis is widely used to investigate autonomous 
      cardiac drive. This method requires periodogram measurement, which can be obtained 
      by an electrocardiogram (ECG) or from a heart rate monitor (HRM), e.g. the Garmin 
      920 XT device. The purpose of this investigation was to assess the accuracy of RR 
      time series measurements from a Garmin 920 XT HRM as compared to a standard ECG, and 
      to verify whether the measurements thus obtained are suitable for HRV analysis. RR 
      time series were collected simultaneously with an ECG (Powerlab system, AD 
      Instruments, Castell Hill, Australia) and a Garmin XT 920 in 11 healthy subjects 
      during three conditions, namely in the supine position, the standing position and 
      during moderate exercise. In a first step, we compared RR time series obtained with 
      both tools using the Bland and Altman method to obtain the limits of agreement in 
      all three conditions. In a second step, we compared the results of HRV analysis 
      between the ECG RR time series and Garmin 920 XT series. Results show that the 
      accuracy of this system is in accordance with the literature in terms of the limits 
      of agreement. In the supine position, bias was 0.01, - 2.24, + 2.26 ms; in the 
      standing position, - 0.01, - 3.12, + 3.11 ms respectively, and during exercise, 
      - 0.01, - 4.43 and + 4.40 ms. Regarding HRV analysis, we did not find any difference 
      for HRV analysis in the supine position, but the standing and exercise conditions 
      both showed small modifications.

TI  - [Evaluation of the impact of guidelines for rationalizing the prescription of preop 
      tests for patients ASA 1 and 2 undergoing elective surgery].
PG  - 37-46
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the impact of implementation of guidelines aimed at reducing 
      the use of laboratory and diagnostic preoperative tests in patients with low 
      anesthesiologic risk, admitted to six public hospital of Ente Ospedaliero Cantonale 
      in Cantone Ticino (Switzerland). DESIGN: Observational study. METHODS: Time series 
      analysis of patterns of use of preoperative tests, on 14,585 patients admitted to 
      public hospitals form March 1996 to June 1998. PRINCIPAL OUTCOME MEASURE: Proportion 
      of patients undergoing a laboratory or other diagnostic tests during three six 
      months periods before guidelines implementation (baseline), during the six months of 
      the implementation phase and during the following four months of adoption of the 
      guidelines in the participating centres. RESULTS: During the four months following 
      the implementation, we observed a reduction of 15% (95% CI: 1%-27%) in the use of 
      azotemia, and a reduction of 34% (95% CI: 18%-50%) for coagulation tests. 
      Corresponding figures for glycemia and chest x-ray indicated a reduction of 44% (95% 
      CI: 32%-54%) and of 22% (95% CI: 8%-34%), respectively. As for other tests 
      (creatinine, ECG), no statistically significant reduction was observed. Most of the 
      observed effect was explained by a reduction in use in patients at a low risk (ASA 1 
      and 2). In addition, guidelines appeared to have a greater impact in the four small 
      (i.e. < 200 beds) hospitals, as compared with the two centres of greater size. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Consistently with the empirical evidence available in this area, this 
      study suggests that guidelines can change clinical practice, when they are 
      implemented through a strategy taking into account adaptation of the recommendations 
      to local circumstances and involvement of health professionals.

AB  - Automatic or semi-automatic analysis of the equine electrocardiogram (eECG) is 
      currently not possible because human or small animal ECG analysis software is 
      unreliable due to a different ECG morphology in horses resulting from a different 
      cardiac innervation. Both filtering, beat detection to classification for eECGs are 
      currently poorly or not described in the literature. There are also no public 
      databases available for eECGs as is the case for human ECGs. In this paper we 
      propose the use of wavelet transforms for both filtering and QRS detection in eECGs. 
      In addition, we propose a novel robust deep neural network using a parallel 
      convolutional neural network architecture for ECG beat classification. The network 
      was trained and tested using both the MIT-BIH arrhythmia and an own made eECG 
      dataset with 26.440 beats on 4 classes: normal, premature ventricular contraction, 
      premature atrial contraction and noise. The network was optimized using a genetic 
      algorithm and an accuracy of 97.7% and 92.6% was achieved for the MIT-BIH and eECG 
      database respectively. Afterwards, transfer learning from the MIT-BIH dataset to the 
      eECG database was applied after which the average accuracy, recall, positive 
      predictive value and F1 score of the network increased with an accuracy of 97.1%.

TI  - Mapping heart dynamics by using nonlinear indicators.
PG  - 5951-4
AB  - A novel approach for the nonlinear characterization of Electrocardiogram (ECG) 
      signals has been developed. The new developed methodology is based on a numerical 
      algorithm that extracts the value of dinfinity (d-infinite) characterizing the 
      asymptotic chaotic behavior of a system. This algorithm also extracts a measure of 
      the maximum Lyapunov exponent and it is applicable to time series where the 
      knowledge of the system structure and laws is not necessary. In order to prove the 
      significance of the extracted parameters, the presented algorithm was applied on a 
      statistically significant number of ECG signals taken from the MIT-BIH database and 
      including normal subjects and subjects affected by arrhythmia and ventricular 
      arrhythmia. A systematic study, analyzing how dinfinity varies with initial 
      condition was performed showing the sensitivity of such parameter to the initial 
      conditions. Furthermore, two maps, one presenting the maximum Lyapunov exponent and 
      the other the dinfinity versus a control parameter II, as a measure of the rate 
      variation, were drawn using the parameters extracted by the experimental data. They 
      clearly show three distinguishable zones where the normal subjects and the subjects 
      affected by the two different pathologies can be mapped and discriminated. 
      Concluding, the newly presented algorithm, thanks to its implementation features and 
      its effectiveness, it lends itself to future real-time implementation for clinical 
      application in the early diagnosis of cardiac pathologies.

TI  - High efficient system for automatic classification of the electrocardiogram beats.
PG  - 996-1011
LID - 10.1007/s10439-010-0229-6 [doi]
AB  - Automatic classification of the electrocardiogram (ECG) signals is an important 
      subject for clinical diagnosis of heart disease. This study investigates the design 
      of a high-efficient system to classify five types of ECG beat namely normal beats 
      and four manifestations of heart arrhythmia, in twofold. First, we propose a system 
      that includes two main modules: a feature extraction module and a classification 
      module. Feature extraction module extracts a suitable combination of the ECG's 
      morphological characteristics and timing interval features. Discrete wavelet 
      transform is used to extract the morphological features. In the classification 
      module, a multi-class support vector machine (SVM)-based classifier is employed. The 
      parameters of this system are determined based on a trial and error method and its 
      performance is evaluated for the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database. Extensive experiments 
      on the parameters of this system such as classifier kernels and various types of 
      features are conducted. These experiments show that in SVM training, the kernels, 
      kernel parameters, and feature selection have very important roles for SVM 
      classification accuracy. Therefore, most appropriates of these parameters should be 
      used for SVM training. Then at the second fold, a novel hybrid intelligent system 
      (HIS) is proposed that consists of three main modules. In the HIS, further to the 
      two mentioned modules, an optimization module is added. In this module, a genetic 
      algorithm is used for optimization of the relevant parameters of system. These 
      parameters are: wavelet filter type for feature extraction, wavelet decomposition 
      level, and classifier's parameters. Experimental results show that optimization 
      improves the recognition system, efficiently, and HIS is more superior to the 
      system, which as constant parameters.

AB  - Myocardial infarction (MI) is a coronary artery disease acquired due to the lack of 
      blood supply in one or more sections of the myocardium, resulting in necrosis in 
      that region. It has different types based on the region of necrosis. In this paper, 
      a statistical approach for classification of Anteroseptal MI (ASMI) is proposed. The 
      first step of the method involves noise elimination and feature extraction from the 
      Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, using multi-resolution wavelet analysis and 
      thresholding-based techniques. In the next step a classification scheme is developed 
      using the nearest neighbour classification rule (NN rule). Both temporal and 
      amplitude features relevant for automatic ASMI diagnosis are extracted from four 
      chest leads v1-v4. The distance metric for NN classifier is calculated using both 
      Euclidian distance and Mahalanobis distance. A relative comparison between these two 
      techniques reveals that the later is superior to the former, as evident from the 
      classification accuracy. The proposed method is tested and validated using the PTB 
      diagnostic database. Classification accuracy for Mahalanobis distance and Euclidean 
      distance-based NN rule are 95.14% and 81.83%, respectively.

TI  - Spatiotemporal correlation analyses: a new procedure for standardisation of DC 
      magnetocardiograms.
PG  - 198-200
AB  - There is a lack of standard methods for the analysis of magnetocardiograms (MCGs). 
      MCG signals have a shape similar to the ECG (P wave, QRS complex, T wave). 
      High-quality multichannel recordings can indicate even slight disturbances of de- 
      and repolarisation. The purpose of our study was to apply a new approach in the 
      analysis of signal-averaged DC-MCGs. DC-MCGs (31-channel) were recorded in 182 
      subjects: 110 patients after myocardial infarction and 72 controls. Spatiotemporal 
      correlation analysis of the QRS complex and T wave patterns throughout the entire 
      heart cycle was used to analyse homogeneity of de- and repolarisation. These plots 
      were compared to standard ECG analyses (electrical axis, Q wave, ST deviation, T 
      polarity and shape). Spatiotemporal correlation analyses seem to be applicable in 
      assessing the course of electrical repolarisation with respect to homogeneity. MCG 
      provided all diagnostic information contained in common ECG recordings at high 
      significance levels. The ECG patterns were included in 5/8 of our parameters for 
      electrical axis, 6/8 for Q-wave, 7/8 for ST deviation and 5/8 for T-polarity based 
      on two time series of correlation coefficients. We conclude that our spatiotemporal 
      correlation approach provides a new tool for standardised analysis of cardiac 
      mapping data such as MCG.

TI  - Correlation between RR, inter-systolic and inter-diastolic intervals and their 
      differences for the analysis of spontaneous heart rate variability.
PG  - 1120-8
LID - 10.1088/0967-3334/37/7/1120 [doi]
AB  - Analysis of heart rate variability (HRV) is performed through interbeat interval 
      time series derived from either electrocardiographic or arterial pressure (AP) 
      recordings. However, little attention has been given to the reliability of 
      calculating the time series from different sources, i.e. electrocardiogram (ECG) or 
      pulse intervals (PI). Therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate the correlation 
      between interbeat interval time series obtained from RR, inter-systolic (SS) and 
      inter-diastolic (DD) intervals, as well as their impact on indices of HRV calculated 
      from series of RR or PI. Conscious rats previously instrumented with subcutaneous 
      electrodes and a catheter into the femoral artery were subjected to simultaneous ECG 
      and AP recording for 5 min. Correlation and Bland-Altman plots between RR and PI 
      were evaluated. Moreover, HRV was analyzed in time (mean cardiac interval, SDNN and 
      RMSSD) and frequency domain (power in LF and HF spectral bands) as well as by 
      nonlinear approaches (symbolic dynamics and sample entropy). First, RR showed a 
      stronger correlation with PI calculated by DD than SS. Second, most HRV indices 
      showed similar results when calculated with RR or DD series, but not with SS series. 
      Considering RR interval as the gold standard for the calculation of cardiac cycle, 
      when using PI inter diastolic intervals are the better choice to study HRV. These 
      findings are quite relevant, especially when AP recording is used for HRV analysis.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The fundus examination is a non-invasive evaluation of the 
      microcirculation of the retina. The aim of the present study is to develop and 
      validate (reliability and validity) the ALTAIR software platform (Automatic image 
      analyser to assess retinal vessel calibre) in order to analyse its utility in 
      different clinical environments. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A cross-sectional study in 
      the first phase and a prospective observational study in the second with 4 years of 
      follow-up. The study will be performed in a primary care centre and will include 386 
      participants. The main measurements will include carotid intima-media thickness, 
      pulse wave velocity by Sphygmocor, cardio-ankle vascular index through the VASERA 
      VS-1500, cardiac evaluation by a digital ECG and renal injury by microalbuminuria 
      and glomerular filtration. The retinal vascular evaluation will be performed using a 
      TOPCON TRCNW200 non-mydriatic retinal camera to obtain digital images of the retina, 
      and the developed software (ALTAIR) will be used to automatically calculate the 
      calibre of the retinal vessels, the vascularised area and the branching pattern. For 
      software validation, the intraobserver and interobserver reliability, the concurrent 
      validity of the vascular structure and function, as well as the association between 
      the estimated retinal parameters and the evolution or onset of new lesions in the 
      target organs or cardiovascular diseases will be examined. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: 
      The study has been approved by the clinical research ethics committee of the 
      healthcare area of Salamanca. All study participants will sign an informed consent 
      to agree to participate in the study in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki 
      and the WHO standards for observational studies. Validation of this tool will 
      provide greater reliability to the analysis of retinal vessels by decreasing the 
      intervention of the observer and will result in increased validity through the use 
      of additional information, especially in the areas of vascularisation and vessel 
      branching patterns. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: Clinical Trials.gov Identifier:

TI  - Yield of screening for atrial fibrillation in primary care with a hand-held, 
      single-lead electrocardiogram device during influenza vaccination.
PG  - 1514-1520
AB  - AIMS: To assess the yield of screening for atrial fibrillation (AF) with a hand-held 
      single-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) device during influenza vaccination in primary 
      care in the Netherlands. METHODS AND RESULTS: We used the MyDiagnostick to screen 
      for AF in persons who participated in influenza vaccination sessions of ten Dutch 
      primary care practices. In case of suspected AF detection by the stick, the recorded 
      1-min ECG registrations were analysed by a cardiologist. We scrutinized electronic 
      medical files of the general practitioners to obtain information about the cases 
      screened. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to predict the 
      relation between patient characteristics and a new screen-detected diagnosis of AF. 
      In total, 3269 persons were screened for AF during the influenza vaccination 
      sessions of 10 general practitioner practices. As a result, 37 (1.1%) new cases of 
      AF were detected. Prior transient ischeamic attack or stroke (OR 6.05; 95%CI 
      1.93-19.0), and age (OR 1.09 per year; 95% CI 1.05-1.14) were independent predictors 
      for such newly screen-detected AF. Of the 37 screen-detected AF cases, 2.7% had a 
      CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc of 0, 18.9% a score of 1, and 78.4% a score of 2 or more. The 
      majority needed oral anticoagulant therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Screening seems feasible 
      with an easy to use single-lead, hand-held ECG device with automatic AF detection 
      during influenza vaccination in primary care and results in a '1-day' yield of 1.1% 
      new cases of AF. TRIAL REGISTRATION CLINICALTRIALSGOV: NCT02006524.

AB  - False intensive care unit (ICU) alarms induce stress in both patients and clinical 
      staff and decrease the quality of care, thus significantly increasing both the 
      hospital recovery time and rehospitalization rates. In the PhysioNet/CinC Challenge 
      2015 for reducing false arrhythmia alarms in ICU bedside monitor data, this paper 
      validates the application of a real-time arrhythmia detection library (ADLib, 
      Schiller AG) for the robust detection of five types of life-threatening arrhythmia 
      alarms. The strength of the application is to give immediate feedback on the 
      arrhythmia event within a scan interval of 3 s-7.5 s, and to increase the noise 
      immunity of electrocardiogram (ECG) arrhythmia analysis by fusing its decision with 
      supplementary ECG quality interpretation and real-time pulse wave monitoring 
      (quality and hemodynamics) using arterial blood pressure or photoplethysmographic 
      signals. We achieved the third-ranked real-time score (79.41) in the challenge 
      (Event 1), however, the rank was not officially recognized due to the 
      'closed-source' entry. This study shows the optimization of the alarm decision 
      module, using tunable parameters such as the scan interval, lead quality threshold, 
      and pulse wave features, with a follow-up improvement of the real-time score 
      (80.07). The performance (true positive rate, true negative rate) is reported in the 
      blinded challenge test set for different arrhythmias: asystole (83%, 96%), extreme 
      bradycardia (100%, 90%), extreme tachycardia (98%, 80%), ventricular tachycardia 
      (84%, 82%), and ventricular fibrillation (78%, 84%). Another part of this study 
      considers the validation of ADLib with four reference ECG databases (AHA, EDB, SVDB, 
      MIT-BIH) according to the international recommendations for performance reports in 
      ECG monitors (ANSI/AAMI EC57). The sensitivity (Se) and positive predictivity (+P) 
      are: QRS detector QRS (Se, +P)  >  99.7%, ventricular ectopic beat (VEB) classifier 
      VEB (Se, +P)  =  95%, and ventricular fibrillation detector VFIB (P  +  = 
      94.8%)  >  VFIB (Se  =  86.4%), adjusted to the clinical setting requirements, 
      giving preference to low false positive alarms.

TI  - Circadian relations among cardiovascular variables of young adults.
PG  - 111-20
AB  - Every 4 hours for 24 hours, 14 clinically healthy young individuals (6 women and 8 
      men), 26 +/- 4 years of age, measured systolic (S) and diastolic (D) blood pressure 
      (BP) by sphygmomanometer and heart rate by ECG and did impedance cardiography under 
      usual living conditions. Stroke volume (SV), cardiac output (CO) and total 
      peripheral resistance (TPR) were calculated. Time series of SBP, DBP, HR, SV, CO and 
      TPR were analyzed by single and population-mean cosinor. A circadian cardiovascular 
      rhythm is demonstrated by rejection of the zero amplitude assumption in the 
      population-mean cosinor test for SBP, DBP, HR, SV, CO and TPR (P < 0.01). TPR peaks 
      around 0400 (-61 degrees from local midnight), in antiphase with all other 
      variables, their acrophase occurring around 1600 (-240 degrees). A circadian rhythm 
      of statistical significance or of borderline statistical significance is found for 
      all variables except TPR in women. Circadian rhythm characteristics were otherwise 
      mostly similar in men and women with a statistically significant gender difference 
      found by parameter tests only for the MESOR and amplitude of SBP.

TI  - [Fractal analysis and arterial hypertension].
PG  - 1121-5
AB  - Fractal analysis is a new tool allowing to study the complexity of cardiovascular 
      variability. This approach may be useful for investigating regulatory mechanisms. In 
      fractal terms, homeostasis required an optimal organisation of complexity (beta 
      coefficient close to 1): conversely, some pathological situations have proven to be 
      associated with an altered organisation of fractals (beta coefficient different from 
      1). Our study aimed at determining if hypertension was associated with an alteration 
      of the fractal component of blood pressure (BP) or heart rate (HR) variability. 
      Eighty-eight subjects referred for high BP entered the study. BP was measured in 
      ambulatory conditions by an automatic device during 24 hours (ABP). BP and HR were 
      then recorded beat-to-beat by a Finapres and an ECG during 30 minutes at rest. The 
      beta coefficient was obtained by coarse-graining spectral analysis from the BP and 
      RR interval time series. This method has proven its interest for breaking down 
      cardiovascular variability into an harmonic component and a non harmonic one, this 
      latter containing fractal elements. Spontaneous baroreflex sensitivity was assessed 
      by the method of sequences. The percentage of fractals contained in BP and RR 
      signals remained relatively stable despite the increasing severity of hypertension. 
      A significant but loose correlation was found between the beta coefficient of RR and 
      ABP (r = 0.23, p = 0.053 with systolic ABP; r = 0.25, p = 0.03 with diastolic ABP). 
      No correlation could be disclosed between ABP and the beta coefficient of BP. The 
      beta coefficient of RR was significantly correlated with the spontaneous baroreflex 
      sensitivity (-0.59, p < 0.0001). It is concluded that it is rather the complexity of 
      HR signal than that of BP which is altered during hypertension. This may suggest 
      that some regulatory processes are lost or less efficient. The correlation reported 
      between the baroreflex gain and the beta coefficient of RR interval may reflect, in 
      fact, an alteration of the parasympathetic drive. Globally, these results emphasise 
      the importance of HR and probably cardiac output in the pathophysiology of high BP.

AB  - AIM: Chest compression artefacts impede a reliable rhythm analysis during 
      cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). These artefacts are not present during 
      ventilations in 30:2 CPR. The aim of this study is to prove that a fully automatic 
      method for rhythm analysis during ventilation pauses in 30:2 CPR is reliable an 
      accurate. METHODS: For this study 1414min of 30:2 CPR from 135 out-of-hospital 
      cardiac arrest cases were analysed. The data contained 1942 pauses in compressions 
      longer than 3.5s. An automatic pause detector identified the pauses using the 
      transthoracic impedance, and a shock advice algorithm (SAA) diagnosed the rhythm 
      during the detected pauses. The SAA analysed 3-s of the ECG during each pause for an 
      accurate shock/no-shock decision. RESULTS: The sensitivity and PPV of the pause 
      detector were 93.5% and 97.3%, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of the 
      SAA in the detected pauses were 93.8% (90% low CI, 90.0%) and 95.9% (90% low CI, 
      94.7%), respectively. Using the method, shocks would have been advanced in 97% of 
      occasions. For patients in nonshockable rhythms, rhythm reassessment pauses would be 
      avoided in 95.2% (95% CI, 91.6-98.8) of occasions, thus increasing the overall chest 
      compression fraction (CCF). CONCLUSION: An automatic method could be used to safely 
      analyse the rhythm during ventilation pauses. This would contribute to an early 
      detection of refibrillation, and to increase CCF in patients with nonshockable 
      rhythms.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The conventional method for ventilation is supported by accommodative or 
      adaptive support ventilation (ASV) that the latter method is done with two methods: 
      ASV minute ventilation (mv): 110% and ASV mv: 120%. Regarding these methods this 
      study compared the differences in duration of mechanical ventilation and hemodynamic 
      changes during recovery and length of stay in Intensive Care Units (ICU). MATERIALS 
      AND METHODS: In a clinical trial study, forty patients candidate for ventilation 
      were selected and randomly divided into two groups of A and B. All patients were 
      ventilated by Rafael ventilator. Ventilator parameters were set on ASV mv: 110% or 
      ASV mv: 120% and patients were monitored on pulse oximetry, electrocardiography 
      monitoring, central vein pressure and arterial pressure. Finally, the data entered 
      to computer and analyzed by SPSS software. RESULTS: The time average of connection 
      to ventilator in two groups in modes of ASV mv: 110% and 120% was 12.3 ± 3.66 and 
      10.8 ± 2.07 days respectively, and according to t-test, there was no significant 
      difference between two groups (P = 0.11). The average of length of stay in ICU in 
      two groups of 110% and 120% was 16.35 ± 3.51 and 15.5 ± 2.62 days respectively, and 
      according to t-test, there found to be no significant difference between two groups 
      (P = 0.41). CONCLUSION: Using ASV mv: 120% can decrease extubation time compared 
      with ASV mv: 110%. Furthermore, there is not a considerable side effect on 
      hemodynamic of patients.

TI  - Automated 3D segmentation and diameter measurement of the thoracic aorta on 
      non-contrast enhanced CT.
PG  - 4613-4623
LID - 10.1007/s00330-018-5931-z [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To develop and evaluate a fully automatic method to measure diameters of 
      the ascending and descending aorta on non-ECG-gated, non-contrast computed 
      tomography (CT) scans. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The method combines multi-atlas 
      registration to obtain seed points, aorta centerline extraction, and an optimal 
      surface segmentation approach to extract the aorta surface around the centerline. 
      From the extracted 3D aorta segmentation, the diameter of the ascending and 
      descending aorta was calculated at cross-sectional slices perpendicular to the 
      extracted centerline, at the level of the pulmonary artery bifurcation, and at 1-cm 
      intervals up to 3 cm above and below this level. Agreement with manual annotations 
      was evaluated by dice similarity coefficient (DSC) for segmentation overlap, mean 
      surface distance (MSD), and intra-class correlation (ICC) of diameters on 100 CT 
      scans from a lung cancer screening trial. Repeatability of the diameter measurements 
      was evaluated on 617 baseline-one year follow-up CT scan pairs. RESULTS: The 
      agreement between manual and automatic segmentations was good with 0.95 ± 0.01 DSC 
      and 0.56 ± 0.08 mm MSD. ICC between the diameters derived from manual and from 
      automatic segmentations was 0.97, with the per-level ICC ranging from 0.87 to 0.94. 
      An ICC of 0.98 for all measurements and per-level ICC ranging from 0.91 to 0.96 were 
      obtained for repeatability. CONCLUSION: This fully automatic method can assess 
      diameters in the thoracic aorta reliably even in non-ECG-gated, non-contrast CT 
      scans. This could be a promising tool to assess aorta dilatation in screening and in 
      clinical practice. KEY POINTS: • Fully automatic method to assess thoracic aorta 
      diameters. • High agreement between fully automatic method and manual segmentations. 
      • Method is suitable for non-ECG-gated CT and can therefore be used in screening.

AB  - Real-time Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) episode detection and monitoring are 
      important for society in terms of an improvement in the health of the general 
      population and of a reduction in mortality and healthcare costs. Currently, to 
      diagnose OSA patients undergo PolySomnoGraphy (PSG), a complicated and invasive test 
      to be performed in a specialized center involving many sensors and wires. 
      Accordingly, each patient is required to stay in the same position throughout the 
      duration of one night, thus restricting their movements. This paper proposes an 
      easy, cheap, and portable approach for the monitoring of patients with OSA, which 
      collects single-channel ElectroCardioGram (ECG) data only. It is easy to perform 
      from the patient's point of view because only one wearable sensor is required, so 
      the patient is not restricted to keeping the same position all night long, and the 
      detection and monitoring can be carried out in any place through the use of a mobile 
      device. Our approach is based on the automatic extraction, from a database 
      containing information about the monitored patient, of explicit knowledge in the 
      form of a set of IF…THEN rules containing typical parameters derived from Heart Rate 
      Variability (HRV) analysis. The extraction is carried out off-line by means of a 
      Differential Evolution algorithm. This set of rules can then be exploited in the 
      real-time mobile monitoring system developed at our Laboratory: the ECG data is 
      gathered by a wearable sensor and sent to a mobile device, where it is processed in 
      real time. Subsequently, HRV-related parameters are computed from this data, and, if 
      their values activate some of the rules describing the occurrence of OSA, an alarm 
      is automatically produced. This approach has been tested on a well-known literature 
      database of OSA patients. The numerical results show its effectiveness in terms of 
      accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, and the achieved sets of rules evidence the 
      user-friendliness of the approach. Furthermore, the method is compared against other 
      well known classifiers, and its discrimination ability is shown to be higher.

AB  - In this paper, we use the CUR matrix factorization as a means of dimension reduction 
      to identify important subsequences in electrocardiogram (ECG) time series. As 
      opposed to other factorizations typically used in dimension reduction that 
      characterize data in terms of abstract representatives (for example, an orthogonal 
      basis), the CUR factorization describes the data in terms of actual instances within 
      the original data set. Therefore, the CUR characterization can be directly related 
      back to the clinical setting. We apply CUR to a synthetic ECG data set as well as to 
      data from the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia, MGH-MF, and Incart databases using the discrete 
      empirical interpolation method (DEIM) and an incremental QR factorization. In doing 
      so, we demonstrate that CUR is able to identify beat morphologies that are 
      representative of the data set, including rare-occurring beat events, providing a 
      robust summarization of the ECG data. We also see that using CUR-selected beats to 
      label the remaining unselected beats via 1-nearest neighbor classification produces 
      results comparable to those presented in other works. While the electrocardiogram is 
      of particular interest here, this work demonstrates the utility of CUR in detecting 
      representative subsequences in quasiperiodic physiological time series.

AB  - Over 10 years ago, the standards for cardiac monitoring were set forth by the 
      Councils on Cardiovascular Nursing, Clinical Cardiology, and Cardiovascular Disease 
      in the Young. The standards were endorsed by the International Society of 
      Computerized Electrocardiology and the American Association of Critical-Care Nurses. 
      The American Heart Association printed the standards as an American Heart 
      Association Scientific Statement. The standards provided direction related to remote 
      telemetry monitoring to acute care hospitals. Since the standards were published, 
      remote monitoring of cardiac patients has increased dramatically prompting research 
      and literature related to appropriate utilization. Appropriate and safe telemetry 
      monitoring requires clearly written evidence-based facility policies. This article 
      describes the process whereby a team of Veterans Hospital Administration nurses from 
      across the country reviewed 70 remote telemetry policies representing 75 Veterans 
      Hospital Administration hospitals for clarity, consistency, and congruency to 
      existing levels of evidence found in the literature. This article describes the 
      processes, successes, and challenges of compiling an evidence-based remote telemetry 
      policy guideline.

TI  - Anatomical Evaluation of the Pulmonary Veins and the Left Atrium Using Computed 
      Tomography Before Catheter Ablation: Reproducibility of Measurements.
PG  - 228-32
LID - 10.12659/PJR.898650 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common supraventricular arrhythmia. 
      ECG-gated MDCT seems to be currently a method of choice for pre-ablation anatomical 
      mapping due to an excellent resolution and truly isotropic three-dimensional nature. 
      The aim of this study was to establish the between-subject variability and 
      inter-observer reproducibility of anatomical evaluation of the pulmonary veins (PV) 
      and the left atrium (LA) using computed tomography. MATERIAL/METHODS: A 
      retrospective analysis included 42 patients with AF, who were scheduled for a 
      cardiac CT for ablation planning. Images were assessed by two independent 
      radiologists using a semi-automatic software tool. The left atrium anatomy (volume, 
      AP diameter), anatomy of the pulmonary veins (number, ostia diameters and surface 
      area) were evaluated. The relative between-subject variability and the 
      inter-observer variability of measurements were calculated. RESULTS: The heart rate 
      during scanning ranged from 50 to 133/min. (mean 79.1/min.) and all examinations 
      were of adequate image quality. Accessory pulmonary veins were found in 24% of 
      patients. Between-subject variability of the PV ostial cross-sectional area ranged 
      from 33% to 48%. The variability of the left atrium size was 21% for the diameter 
      and 35% for the volume. The inter-observer agreement for the detection of accessory 
      pulmonary veins was good (κ=0.73; 95% CI, 0.54-0.93). CONCLUSIONS: Between-subject 
      variability of the pulmonary vein ostial cross-sectional area and the left artial 
      volume is substantial. The anatomical assessment of the pulmonary vein ostia and the 
      left atrium size in computed tomography presents a good inter-observer 
      reproducibility.

AB  - Smart health is quickly boosted by technological advancements: smart sensors, body 
      sensor network, internet of medical things and big data. Vast amounts of smart 
      health big data from ubiquitous sensors pose unprecedented challenges to the 
      security and privacy protection, which is extremely critical in healthcare 
      applications. The vital signs, user daily behaviors, medicine recommendations, and 
      so many other health data are vulnerable to different attacks, due to the fact that 
      wearable/mobile monitors have very strict performance/power constraints, which limit 
      the complexity of security protocols. In this paper, we study how to leverage a 
      natural vital signal (Electrocardiogram - ECG) for user identification purpose, 
      without introducing new hardware sensing devices. ECG is not only a gold standard 
      cardiac signal, but also unique to each individual. We investigate a phase-domain 
      deep patient-ECG image learning framework, to tackle key challenges in ECG biometric 
      user identification: high diversities of ECG morphologies due to heart diseases, and 
      time-consuming/ineffective heartbeat localization methods & manual feature 
      engineering. The ultimate goal is to make the smart health security zero-effort: use 
      `phase-domain transformation' to enable blind signal segmentation without localizing 
      heartbeats; create a computer image processing-like task by `pixelating' 
      phase-domain ECG trajectories to ECG images; and enable automatic (non-manual) `deep 
      feature learning' using a deep convolutional neural network. Evaluated on two 
      patient-ECG databases, this zero-effort framework achieves an accuracy as high as 
      97.2%, and greatly outperforms state-of-the-art studies in terms of the 
      generalization ability and/or performance. This study is expected to enable highly 
      challenging patient-ECG biometric user identification, by generalizable blind signal 
      segmentation and deep feature learning strategies, in the era of smart health 
      boosted by internet of medical things and big medical data.

AB  - Biomedical time series clustering that groups a set of unlabelled temporal signals 
      according to their underlying similarity is very useful for biomedical records 
      management and analysis such as biosignals archiving and diagnosis. In this paper, a 
      new framework for clustering of long-term biomedical time series such as 
      electrocardiography (ECG) and electroencephalography (EEG) signals is proposed. 
      Specifically, local segments extracted from the time series are projected as a 
      combination of a small number of basis elements in a trained dictionary by 
      non-negative sparse coding. A Bag-of-Words (BoW) representation is then constructed 
      by summing up all the sparse coefficients of local segments in a time series. Based 
      on the BoW representation, a probabilistic topic model that was originally developed 
      for text document analysis is extended to discover the underlying similarity of a 
      collection of time series. The underlying similarity of biomedical time series is 
      well captured attributing to the statistic nature of the probabilistic topic model. 
      Experiments on three datasets constructed from publicly available EEG and ECG 
      signals demonstrates that the proposed approach achieves better accuracy than 
      existing state-of-the-art methods, and is insensitive to model parameters such as 
      length of local segments and dictionary size.

TI  - Effects of iopamidol-370 versus iodixanol-320 on coronary contrast, branch 
      depiction, and heart rate variability in dual-source coronary MDCT angiography.
PG  - W445-51
LID - 10.2214/AJR.10.6154 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this article is to assess whether iopamidol-370 provides 
      superior vascular contrast of the coronaries and depiction of anatomic detail 
      without affecting heart rate and beat-to-beat variability during coronary 
      dual-source MDCT compared with iodixanol-320. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: In this 
      prospective trial, coronary CT angiography was performed on 60 adult patients using 
      either iopamidol-370 or iodixanol-320. Cohorts were matched by age, habitus, sex, 
      and baseline heart rate, with cohort sizes determined by power analysis. All studies 
      were performed on a dual-source MDCT scanner with retrospective ECG-gating utilizing 
      automatic pitch adjustment. Data assessment focused on heart rate variability during 
      contrast administration statistically evaluated as Student t test comparisons within 
      and between cohorts, coronary contrast-to-noise ratio analysis of the main coronary 
      arteries utilizing Student t test comparisons between cohorts, and coronary branch 
      depiction and distribution analysis in dual-reader consensus decisions between 
      cohorts. RESULTS: Thirty patients matched for age, habitus, sex, and heart rate were 
      evaluated in each cohort. ECG analyses found a statistically significant (p = 0.013) 
      decrease in heart rate during administration of iodixanol-320. Beat-to-beat 
      variations, expressed as coefficient of variation, within and among cohorts were low 
      (coefficient of variation, < 0.05). Contrast-to-noise ratio was significantly 
      increased for iopamidol-370 versus iodixanol-320 (aortic root, p = 0.021; left main, 
      p = 0.032; left anterior descending, p = 0.033; left circumflex, p = 0.039; and 
      right, p = 0.009). Analysis of coronary branch visualization revealed improved 
      depiction for iopamidol-370 compared with iodixanol-320. CONCLUSION: Iopamidol-370, 
      with its higher iodine concentration, provided greater vascular contrast of the 
      arterial coronary tree and improved depiction of anatomic detail without 
      significantly impacting cardiac heart rate during coronary MDCT imaging, as compared 
      with iodixanol-320.

AB  - BACKGROUND: With recent technology, multivariate time-series electrocardiogram (ECG) 
      analysis has played an important role in diagnosing cardiovascular diseases. 
      However, discovering the association of wide range aging disease and chronic habit 
      with ECG analysis still has room to be explored. This article mainly analyzes the 
      possible relationship between common aging diseases or chorionic habits of medical 
      record and ECG, such as diabetes, obesity, and hypertension, or the habit of 
      smoking. METHODS: In the research, we first conducted different ECG features, such 
      as those of reduced binary pattern, waveform, and wavelet and then performed a 
      k-means clustering analysis on the correlation between ECGs and the aforementioned 
      diseases and habits, from which it is expected to find a firm association between 
      them and the best characteristics that can be used for future research. RESULTS: In 
      summary, we discovered a weak and strong evidence between ECG and medical records. 
      For strong evidence, most patients with diabetes are always assigned into a 
      specified group no matter the number of classes in the k-means clustering, which 
      means we can find their association between them. For weak evidence, smokers, 
      obesity, and hypertension have less unique ECG feature vector, enabling clustering 
      them into specific groups, so the ECGs might be used to identify smokers, obesity, 
      and hypertension. It is also interesting that we found obesity and hypertension, 
      which are thought to be related to cardiovascular system. However, they are not 
      highly correlated in our clustering analysis, which might indirectly tell us that 
      the impact of obesity and hypertension to our body is various. In addition, the 
      clustering effect of waveform feature is better than the other two methods.

AB  - The central nervous system regulates recruitment and firing of motor units to 
      modulate muscle tension. Estimation of the firing rate time series is typically 
      performed by decomposing the electromyogram (EMG) into its constituent firing times, 
      then lowpass filtering a constituent train of impulses. Little research has examined 
      the performance of different estimation methods, particularly in the inevitable 
      presence of decomposition errors. The study of electrocardiogram (ECG) and 
      electroneurogram (ENG) firing rate time series presents a similar problem, and has 
      applied novel simulation models and firing rate estimators. Herein, we adapted an 
      ENG/ECG simulation model to generate realistic EMG firing times derived from known 
      rates, and assessed various firing rate time series estimation methods. 
      ENG/ECG-inspired rate estimation worked exceptionally well when EMG decomposition 
      errors were absent, but degraded unacceptably with decomposition error rates of ⩾1%. 
      Typical EMG decomposition error rates-even after expert manual review-are 3-5%. At 
      realistic decomposition error rates, more traditional EMG smoothing approaches 
      performed best, when optimal smoothing window durations were selected. This optimal 
      window was often longer than the 400ms duration that is commonly used in the 
      literature. The optimal duration decreased as the modulation frequency of firing 
      rate increased, average firing rate increased and decomposition errors decreased. 
      Examples of these rate estimation methods on physiologic data are also provided, 
      demonstrating their influence on measures computed from the firing rate estimate.

TI  - Detecting Subclinical Diabetic Cardiac Autonomic Neuropathy by Analyzing Ventricular 
      Repolarization Dynamics.
PG  - 64-72
LID - 10.1109/JBHI.2015.2426206 [doi]
AB  - In this study, a linear parametric modeling technique was applied to model 
      ventricular repolarization (VR) dynamics. Three features were selected from the 
      surface ECG recordings to investigate the changes in VR dynamics in healthy and 
      cardiac autonomic neuropathy (CAN) participants with diabetes including heart rate 
      variability (calculated from RR intervals), repolarization variability (calculated 
      from QT intervals), and respiration [calculated by ECG-derived respiration (EDR)]. 
      Surface ECGs were recorded in a supine resting position from 80 age-matched 
      participants (40 with no cardiac autonomic neuropathy (NCAN) and 40 with CAN). In 
      the CAN group, 25 participants had early/subclinical CAN (ECAN) and 15 participants 
      were identified with definite/clinical CAN (DCAN). Detecting subclinical CAN is 
      crucial for designing an effective treatment plan to prevent further cardiovascular 
      complications. For CAN diagnosis, VR dynamics was analyzed using linear parametric 
      autoregressive bivariate (ARXAR) and trivariate (ARXXAR) models, which were 
      estimated using 250 beats of derived QT, RR, and EDR time series extracted from the 
      first 5 min of the recorded ECG signal. Results showed that the EDR-based models 
      gave a significantly higher fitting value (p < 0.0001) than models without EDR, 
      which indicates that QT-RR dynamics is better explained by 
      respiratory-information-based models. Moreover, the QT-RR-EDR model fitting values 
      gradually decreased from the NCAN group to ECAN and DCAN groups, which indicate a 
      decoupling of QT from RR and the respiration signal with the increase in severity of 
      CAN. In this study, only the EDR-based model significantly distinguished ECAN and 
      DCAN groups from the NCAN group (p < 0.05) with large effect sizes (Cohen's d > 
      0.75) showing the effectiveness of this modeling technique in detecting subclinical 
      CAN. In conclusion, the EDR-based trivariate QT-RR-EDR model was found to be better 
      in detecting the presence and severity of CAN than the bivariate QT-RR model. This 
      finding also establishes the importance of adding respiratory information for 
      analyzing the gradual deterioration of normal VR dynamics in pathological 
      conditions, such as diabetic CAN.

AB  - Psychiatric symptoms are often accompanied by somatic symptoms induced by the 
      activity of the autonomic nervous system (ANS). The aim of this study was to 
      calculate the time lag between electroencephalography (EEG) and electrocardiography 
      (ECG) responses, to clarify the changes in the relationship between the cerebral 
      cortex (CC) and the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) during emotional recall 
      processing. Twenty-two healthy young adults were examined. Their EEG and ECG data 
      were simultaneously recorded during emotional audiovisual recall tasks using 
      pleasant and unpleasant stimuli for 180 s, with three repetitions (Epochs 1 & 2 and 
      Epoch 3). The EEG data were analyzed using a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to obtain 
      a time series of relative power spectra, XE, in the theta 1, theta 2, alpha 1, alpha 
      2, alpha 3, beta 1, beta 2, and beta 3 bands. Time series of RR (inter-beat) 
      intervals (time intervals between successive R waves) derived from the ECG spectral 
      analysis using FFT was applied to the resampled time series of RR intervals over 
      about 60 s to obtain a time series of power spectra for the ratio low frequency/high 
      frequency (LH/HF), XC, which reflects the activity of the sympathetic nervous 
      function. The time lag between XE and XC was calculated using 
      wavelet-crosscorrelation analysis. The results demonstrated that the brain responded 
      to unfamiliar emotionally pleasant stimuli in Epochs 1 & 2 earlier than the SNS, 
      whereas the brain and SNS responded to unfamiliar unpleasant stimuli nearly 
      simultaneously. The brain was activated rapidly in response to familiar unpleasant 
      stimuli, although SNS responded more rapidly to familiar pleasant stimuli than the 
      brain in Epoch 3. Our results quantitatively describe the relationship between the 
      CC and the ANS during emotional recall.

PG  - 264-9
AB  - 30 young males performed inspiratory breath holdings during expectation of an 
      aversive stimulus and at relative rest. The consecutive R-R intervals of the ECG 
      from breath-hold trial were analysed via spectral analysis of time series. Following 
      parameters were ascertained for each breath holding: mean R-R interval, total R-R 
      interval variability, breath-hold time and relative variability in three spectral 
      bands 3-8 s, 8-12 s and 12-18 s. Neither of these variables was influenced by 
      expectation of an aversive stimulus. The data were subsequently analysed by means of 
      multivariate analysis. Three distinct frequency components were selected according 
      to both histogram data and multivariate analysis. Their modal periods were 5-6 s, 12 
      s and 16 s respectively. The 8-12 s component of R-R interval variability dominated 
      during breath holdings. The 3-8 s band bore a negative relationship to breath-hold 
      time.

TI  - Analysis of physiological signals using state space correlation entropy.
PG  - 30-33
LID - 10.1049/htl.2016.0065 [doi]
AB  - In this letter, the authors propose a new entropy measure for analysis of time 
      series. This measure is termed as the state space correlation entropy (SSCE). The 
      state space reconstruction is used to evaluate the embedding vectors of a time 
      series. The SSCE is computed from the probability of the correlations of the 
      embedding vectors. The performance of SSCE measure is evaluated using both synthetic 
      and real valued signals. The experimental results reveal that, the proposed SSCE 
      measure along with SVM classifier have sensitivity value of 91.60%, which is higher 
      than the performance of both sample entropy and permutation entropy features for 
      detection of shockable ventricular arrhythmia.

TI  - Mobile telemonitoring for arrhythmias in outpatients in the Republic of Georgia: a 
      brief report of a pilot study.
PG  - 570-1
LID - 10.1089/tmj.2011.0170 [doi]
AB  - As the very first trial of mobile telemedicine in the Republic of Georgia, in 
      June-December 2010 we investigated 35 outpatients with different types of arrhythmia 
      (male/female ratio=16/19; 12-80 years old), among them 5 patients with concomitant 
      epilepsy. The control group comprised 7 clinically healthy sportsmen (soccer 
      players, all men; 15-17 years old), during a 30-min velo ergometer stress test. A 
      three-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) loop recorder (Vitaphone BT 3300; Vitasystems 
      GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) was used in automatic mode, using special LRMA software 
      (MDT, Lázně Bohdaneč, Czech Republic) and a Nokia (Espoo, Finland) model 6730 
      Symbian phone. Automatically recorded arrhythmia events were transmitted from the 
      loop recorder by Bluetooth(®) (Bluetooth SIG, Inc., Kirkland, WA) to a phone and 
      then by 3G (through our partner mobile operator, MagtiCom Ltd. [Tbilsi, Georgia]) to 
      the Vitasystems server in Germany and were available to Georgian physicians via 
      e-mail/Internet. Arrhythmias were recorded/monitored during 7-68 h of observation. 
      The number of automatically recorded ECG events varied between 3 and 170 per 
      observation, or 0.4-10.7 hourly. Cases of sinus brady- and tachyarrhythmia, sinus 
      node weakness syndrome, atrial fibrillation, supraventricular tachycardia, 
      supraventricular premature complexes, and ventricular premature complexes were 
      correctly recognized by automatic recognition software and recorded. In 3 patients 
      and 1 sportsman previously unspecified (despite multiple investigations), 
      arrhythmias were recorded: paroxysmal tachycardia (n=1), sinus node weakness 
      syndrome (n=1), and ventricular premature complexes (n=2). In 3 cases (all women) 
      light insomnia and nervousness were reported. In 2 patients with neurosis (both 
      elderly men, 1 with epilepsy) we had to stop investigation prematurely because of 
      anxiety/agitation. Mobile telecardiology represents feasible methodology to monitor 
      arrhythmias in outpatients in Georgia, promoting earlier discharge of 
      non-life-threatening cases, improving patients' comfort of life, and increasing 
      their mobility with enhanced safety. Mobile telehealth might also represent 
      significant cost-saving for insurance companies (this is an ongoing study). Finally, 
      in remote areas mobile telemonitoring of patients will improve quality of care by 
      timely provision of a second opinion in cases when local expertise is not 
      sufficient.

AB  - Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common sleep disorder that affects 24% of adult 
      men and 9% of adult women. It occurs due to the occlusion of the upper airway during 
      sleep, thereby leading to a decrease of blood oxygen level that triggers arousals 
      and sleep fragmentation. OSA significantly impacts the quality of sleep and it is 
      known to be responsible for a number of health complications, such as high blood 
      pressure and type 2 diabetes. Traditional diagnosis of OSA relies on 
      polysomnography, which is expensive, time-consuming and inaccessible to the general 
      population. Recent advancement of sensing provides an unprecedented opportunity for 
      the screening of OSA events using single-channel electrocardiogram (ECG). However, 
      existing approaches are limited in their ability to characterize nonlinear dynamics 
      underlying ECG signals. As such, hidden patterns of OSA-altered cardiac electrical 
      activity cannot be fully revealed and understood. This paper presents a new 
      heterogeneous recurrence model to characterize the heart rate variability for the 
      identification of OSA. A nonlinear state space is firstly reconstructed from a time 
      series of RR intervals that are extracted from single-channel ECGs. Further, the 
      state space is recursively partitioned into a hierarchical structure of local 
      recurrence regions. A new fractal representation is designed to efficiently 
      characterize state transitions among segmented sub-regions. Statistical measures are 
      then developed to quantify heterogeneous recurrence patterns. In addition, we 
      integrate classification models with heterogeneous recurrence features to 
      differentiate healthy subjects from OSA patients. Experimental results show that the 
      proposed approach captures heterogeneous recurrence patterns in the transformed 
      space and provides an effective tool to detect OSA using one-lead ECG signals.

AB  - Standard clinical care in neonatal and pediatric intensive-care units (NICUs and 
      PICUs, respectively) involves continuous monitoring of vital signs with hard-wired 
      devices that adhere to the skin and, in certain instances, can involve 
      catheter-based pressure sensors inserted into the arteries. These systems entail 
      risks of causing iatrogenic skin injuries, complicating clinical care and impeding 
      skin-to-skin contact between parent and child. Here we present a wireless, 
      non-invasive technology that not only offers measurement equivalency to existing 
      clinical standards for heart rate, respiration rate, temperature and blood 
      oxygenation, but also provides a range of important additional features, as 
      supported by data from pilot clinical studies in both the NICU and PICU. These new 
      modalities include tracking movements and body orientation, quantifying the 
      physiological benefits of skin-to-skin care, capturing acoustic signatures of 
      cardiac activity, recording vocal biomarkers associated with tonality and temporal 
      characteristics of crying and monitoring a reliable surrogate for systolic blood 
      pressure. These platforms have the potential to substantially enhance the quality of 
      neonatal and pediatric critical care.

TI  - Differentiation of Heart Failure Patients by the Ratio of the Scaling Exponents of 
      Cardiac Interbeat Intervals.
PG  - 570

LID - 570
AB  - Heart failure (HF) is one of the most frequent heart diseases. It is usually 
      characterized with structural and functional cardiac abnormalities followed by 
      dysfunction of autonomic cardiac control. Current methods of heartbeat interval 
      analysis are not capable to differentiate HF patients and some new differentiation 
      of HF patients could be useful in the determination of the direction of their 
      treatment. In this study, we examined potential of the ratio of the short-term and 
      long-term scaling exponents (α (1) and α (2)) to separate HF patients with similar 
      level of reduced cardiac autonomic nervous system control and with no significant 
      difference in age, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and NYHA class. 
      Thirty-five healthy control subjects and 46 HF patients underwent 20 min of 
      continuous supine resting ECG recording. The interbeat interval time series were 
      analyzed using standardized power spectrum analysis, detrended fluctuation analysis 
      method and standard Poincaré plot (PP) analysis with measures of asymmetry of the 
      PP. Compared with healthy control group, in HF patients linear measures of autonomic 
      cardiac control were statistically significantly reduced (p < 0.05), heart rate 
      asymmetry was preserved (C (up) > C (down), p < 0.01), and long-term scaling 
      exponent α (2) was significantly higher. Cluster analysis of the ratio of short- and 
      long-term scaling exponents showed capability of this parameter to separate four 
      clusters of HF patients. Clusters were determined by interplay of presence of 
      short-term and long-term correlations in interbeat intervals. Complementary measure, 
      commonly accepted ratio of the PP descriptors, SD2/SD1, showed tendency toward 
      statistical significance to separate HF patients in obtained clusters. Also, heart 
      rate asymmetry was preserved only in two clusters. Finally, a multiple regression 
      analysis showed that the ratio α (1)/α (2) could be used as an integrated measure of 
      cardiac dynamic with complex physiological background which, besides spectral 
      components as measures of autonomic cardiac control, also involves breathing 
      frequency and mechanical cardiac parameter, left ventricular ejection fraction.

TI  - Development and validation of a new automatic algorithm for quantification of left 
      ventricular volumes and function in gated myocardial perfusion SPECT using cardiac 
      magnetic resonance as reference standard.
PG  - 874-85
LID - 10.1007/s12350-011-9427-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: By gating image acquisition in myocardial perfusion SPECT (MPS) to ECG, 
      left ventricular (LV) volumes and function can be determined. Several previous 
      studies have shown that existing MPS software packages underestimate LV volumes 
      compared to cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR). The aim of this study was therefore to 
      develop a new LV segmentation algorithm for gated MPS using CMR as reference 
      standard. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 126 patients with suspected coronary 
      artery disease, who underwent both gated MPS and CMR were retrospectively included. 
      The proposed LV segmentation algorithm (Segment) was trained in 26 patients, and 
      tested in 100 patients in comparison to four commercially available MPS software 
      packages (QGS, MyoMetrix, ECTb, and Exini) using CMR as reference standard. Mean 
      bias ± SD between MPS and CMR was for EDV -5% ± 12%, -43% ± 8%, -40% ± 8%, 
      -42% ± 9%, -32% ± 7%, for ESV 0% ± 17%, -41% ± 16%, -34% ± 15%, -54% ± 13%, 
      -41% ± 10%, for EF -2% ± 13%, -1% ± 14%, -7% ± 15%, 17% ± 16%, 10% ± 17% for 
      Segment, QGS, MyoMetrix, ECTb, and Exini, respectively, and for LVM 3% ± 18%, 
      33% ± 25%, 37% ± 24% for Segment, QGS, and ECTb, respectively. Correlation between 
      MPS by Segment and CMR were for EDV R (2) = 0.89, for ESV R (2) = 0.92, for EF R 
      (2) = 0.69, and for LVM R (2) = 0.72, with no difference compared to the correlation 
      between the other MPS software packages and CMR (EDV R (2) = 0.86-0.92, ESV R 
      (2) = 0.91-0.93, EF R (2) = 0.64-0.65, and LVM R (2) = 0.68-0.70). CONCLUSION: The 
      Segment software quantifies LV volumes and EF by MPS with similar correlation and a 
      low bias compared to other MPS software packages, using CMR as reference standard. 
      Hence, the Segment software shows potential to provide clinically relevant volumes 
      and functional values from MPS.

      times.
PG  - 4248-4251
LID - 10.1109/EMBC.2016.7591665 [doi]
AB  - To measure pulse transit times (PTT) and calculate pulse wave velocities (PWV), 
      tri-axial and uniaxial accelerometers were placed in groups of 2 to 4 over the 
      manubrium, xiphoid process, forehead, wrist and ankle, and/or over the carotid, 
      femoral, and posterior auricular arteries in 11 consented supine subjects. Signals 
      were sampled at 1 kHz and filtered. Radial vectors were calculated from the 
      tri-axial measurements. A 3-lead ECG was simultaneously collected over the same 180 
      s window, as well as respiratory rate. Ensemble averages (with ±S.D.) and raster 
      plots were generated for each filtered time series from 200 ms before to 800 ms 
      after the peak of each ECG R-wave. Lag times between the R-wave peak (taken as t=0) 
      and one or more prominent peaks (or valleys if appropriate) of the various 
      accelerometer signals were calculated, by using the signal from the axis (or the 
      radial vector) with the best signal to noise ratio. PWV was calculated from the 
      regression of the distance measured versus the PTT between pairs, especially of the 
      clinically-relevant carotid-femoral PTT. A spectral analysis of each ensemble was 
      taken, with the hypothesis that in young adults the measures at the periphery would 
      have less energy at higher frequencies than those of an older adult because of 
      age-related changes in arterial distensibility.

TI  - Development and validation of an automatic method to detect the latest contracting 
      viable left ventricular segments to assist guide CRT therapy from gated SPECT 
      myocardial perfusion imaging.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study is to use ECG-gated SPECT MPI to detect the 
      latest contracting viable left ventricular (LV) segments to help guide the LV probe 
      placement used in CRT therapy and to validate segment selection against the visual 
      integration method by experts. METHODS: For each patient, the resting ECG-gated 
      SPECT MPI short-axis images were sampled in 3D to generate a polar map of the 
      perfusion distribution used to determine LV myocardial viability, and to measure LV 
      synchronicity using our phase analysis tool. In the visual integration method, two 
      experts visually interpreted the LV viability and mechanical dyssynchrony from the 
      short-axis images and polar maps of viability and phase, to determine the latest 
      contracting viable segments using the 17-segment model. In the automatic method, the 
      apical segments, septal segments, and segments with more than 50% scar were excluded 
      as these are not candidates for CRT LV probe placement. Amongst the remaining viable 
      segments, the segments, whose phase angles were within 10° of the latest phase angle 
      (the most delayed contracting segment), were identified for potential CRT LV probe 
      placement and ranked based on the phase angles of the segments. Both methods were 
      tested in 36 pre-CRT patients who underwent ECG-gated SPECT MPI. The accuracy was 
      determined as the percent agreement between the visual integration and automatic 
      methods. The automatic method was performed by a second independent operator to 
      evaluate the inter-operator processing reproducibility. RESULTS: In all the 36 
      patients, the LV lead positions of the 1st choices recommended by the automatic and 
      visual integration methods were in the same segments in 35 patients, which achieved 
      an agreement rate of 97.2%. In the inter-operator reproducibility test, the LV lead 
      positions of the 1st choices recommended by the two operators were in the same 
      segments in 25 patients, and were in the adjacent segments in 7 patients, which 
      achieved an overall agreement of 88.8%. CONCLUSIONS: An automatic method has been 
      developed to detect the latest contracting viable LV segments to help guide the LV 
      probe placement used in CRT therapy. The retrospective clinical study with 36 
      patients suggests that this method has high agreement against the visual integration 
      method by experts and good inter-operator reproducibility. Consequently, this method 
      is promising to be a clinical tool to recommend the CRT LV lead positions.

AB  - The incidence of heart disease increases with age. The typical method of monitoring 
      arrhythmia is to use a body patch type sensor with a wet electrode. Even though this 
      sensor is easy to use, it has several disadvantages such as problems caused by wet 
      electrodes in tissues when they are monitored for long periods. Thus, a monitoring 
      sensor integrated into clothes with a dry electrode is proposed. In this study, we 
      developed a smart outdoor shirt equipped with a dry electrode electrocardiogram 
      (ECG) sensor for a cardiac arrhythmia computer-aided diagnosis system. The sensor 
      can be inserted in a console close to the chest, charged, used to communicate 
      wirelessly, and can be connected to a smartphone application. According to 
      experiments, the ECG signals measured by the smart shirt indicated that 97.5 ± 1% of 
      the signals could be measured in an immobile state and at least 85.2 ± 2% of the 
      signals could be measured during movement. In addition, we propose a computer-aided 
      diagnosis system for detecting cardiac arrhythmia. It was determined through 
      experiments that the system can detect arrhythmia with an accuracy of 98.2 ± 2%.

AB  - Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death worldwide, and coronary 
      artery disease (CAD) is a major contributor. Early-stage CAD can progress if 
      undiagnosed and left untreated, leading to myocardial infarction (MI) that may 
      induce irreversible heart muscle damage, resulting in heart chamber remodeling and 
      eventual congestive heart failure (CHF). Electrocardiography (ECG) signals can be 
      useful to detect established MI, and may also be helpful for early diagnosis of CAD. 
      For the latter especially, the ECG perturbations can be subtle and potentially 
      misclassified during manual interpretation and/or when analyzed by traditional 
      algorithms found in ECG instrumentation. For automated diagnostic systems (ADS), 
      deep learning techniques are favored over conventional machine learning techniques, 
      due to the automatic feature extraction and selection processes involved. This paper 
      highlights various deep learning algorithms exploited for the classification of ECG 
      signals into CAD, MI, and CHF conditions. The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), 
      followed by combined CNN and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models, appear to be the 
      most useful architectures for classification. A 16-layer LSTM model was developed in 
      our study and validated using 10-fold cross-validation. A classification accuracy of 
      98.5% was achieved. Our proposed model has the potential to be a useful diagnostic 
      tool in hospitals for the classification of abnormal ECG signals.

AB  - The complex interactions that give rise to heart rate variability (HRV) involve 
      coupled physiological oscillators operating over a wide range of different 
      frequencies and length-scales. Based on the premise that interactions are key to the 
      functioning of complex systems, the time-dependent deterministic coupling parameters 
      underlying cardiac, respiratory and vascular regulation have been investigated at 
      both the central and microvascular levels. Hypertension was considered as an example 
      of a globally altered state of the complex dynamics of the cardiovascular system. 
      Its effects were established through analysis of simultaneous recordings of the 
      electrocardiogram (ECG), respiratory effort, and microvascular blood flow [by laser 
      Doppler flowmetry (LDF)]. The signals were analyzed by methods developed to capture 
      time-dependent dynamics, including the wavelet transform, wavelet-based phase 
      coherence, non-linear mode decomposition, and dynamical Bayesian inference, all of 
      which can encompass the inherent frequency and coupling variability of living 
      systems. Phases of oscillatory modes corresponding to the cardiac (around 1.0 Hz), 
      respiratory (around 0.25 Hz), and vascular myogenic activities (around 0.1 Hz) were 
      extracted and combined into two coupled networks describing the central and 
      peripheral systems, respectively. The corresponding spectral powers and coupling 
      functions were computed. The same measurements and analyses were performed for three 
      groups of subjects: healthy young (Y group, 24.4 ± 3.4 y), healthy aged (A group, 
      71.1 ± 6.6 y), and aged treated hypertensive patients (ATH group, 70.3 ± 6.7 y). It 
      was established that the degree of coherence between low-frequency oscillations near 
      0.1 Hz in blood flow and in HRV time series differs markedly between the groups, 
      declining with age and nearly disappearing in treated hypertension. Comparing the 
      two healthy groups it was found that the couplings to the cardiac rhythm from both 
      respiration and vascular myogenic activity decrease significantly in aging. 
      Comparing the data from A and ATH groups it was found that the coupling from the 
      vascular myogenic activity is significantly weaker in treated hypertension subjects, 
      implying that the mechanisms of microcirculation are not completely restored by 
      current anti-hypertension medications.

TI  - Atrial Fibrillation Detection in Short Single Lead ECG Recordings Using Wavelet 
      Transform and Artificial Neural Networks.
PG  - 5982-5985
LID - 10.1109/EMBC.2018.8513562 [doi]
AB  - Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common health issue, not only in developed countries 
      but also in developing ones. AF can lead to strokes, heart failures, and even death 
      if it is not diagnosed and treated on time, therefore automatic detection of AF is 
      an urgent need, particularly using Internet- connected devices that can alert 
      healthcare services. Detection of AF typically involves the analysis of 
      electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings, where P-waves that characterize the atrial 
      activity are substituted with f-waves of variable amplitude and duration. In this 
      paper, we used the discrete wavelet transform to decompose the ECG signal into 
      detail and approximation coefficients with different time-frequency resolutions. 
      Features extracted from ECG signals, RR interval time series and detail and 
      approximation coefficients were used as inputs to an artificial neural network 
      trained to identify four classes of heart rhythms: normal sinus rhythm (NSR), AF, 
      other rhythms (OR) and noisy signals (NS). By performing a Monte Carlo 10- fold 
      cross-validation of 10 iterations approach, average micro F(1) scores of 83.64%, 
      61.61%, 56.88% and 53.88% to classify NSR, AF, OR and NS respectively, and average 
      macro F(1) of 64.00% were obtained on the publicly available training set of 
      PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2017. In addition, in a one-vs.-the-rest 
      strategy, i.e., AF-vs-the-rest, averages sensitivity and specificity of 95.70% and 
      72.39% respectively were achieved to classify AF recordings.

LID - 10.1093/sleep/zsz276 [doi]
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: Up to 5% of adults in Western countries have undiagnosed 
      sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). Studies have shown that electrocardiogram 
      (ECG)-based algorithms can identify SDB and may provide alternative screening. Most 
      studies, however, have limited generalizability as they have been conducted using 
      the apnea-ECG database, a small sample database that lacks complex SDB cases. 
      METHODS: Here, we developed a fully automatic, data-driven algorithm that classifies 
      apnea and hypopnea events based on the ECG using almost 10 000 polysomnographic 
      sleep recordings from two large population-based samples, the Sleep Heart Health 
      Study (SHHS) and the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), which contain 
      subjects with a broad range of sleep and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) to ensure 
      heterogeneity. RESULTS: Performances on average were sensitivity(Se)=68.7%, 
      precision (Pr)=69.1%, score (F1)=66.6% per subject, and accuracy of correctly 
      classifying apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) severity score was Acc=84.9%. Target AHI and 
      predicted AHI were highly correlated (R2 = 0.828) across subjects, indicating 
      validity in predicting SDB severity. Our algorithm proved to be statistically robust 
      between databases, between different periodic leg movement index (PLMI) severity 
      groups, and for subjects with previous CVD incidents. Further, our algorithm 
      achieved the state-of-the-art performance of Se=87.8%, Sp=91.1%, Acc=89.9% using 
      independent comparisons and Se=90.7%, Sp=95.7%, Acc=93.8% using a transfer learning 
      comparison on the apnea-ECG database. CONCLUSIONS: Our robust and automatic 
      algorithm constitutes a minimally intrusive and inexpensive screening system for the 
      detection of SDB events using the ECG to alleviate the current problems and costs 
      associated with diagnosing SDB cases and to provide a system capable of identifying 
      undiagnosed SDB cases.

AB  - Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a highly prevalent sleep disorder, which results in 
      daytime symptoms, a reduced quality of life as well as long-term negative health 
      consequences. OSA diagnosis and severity rating is typically based on the 
      apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) retrieved from overnight poly(somno)graphy. However, 
      polysomnography is costly, obtrusive and not suitable for long-term recordings. 
      Here, we present a method for unobtrusive estimation of the AHI using ECG-based 
      features to detect OSA-related events. Moreover, adding ECG-based sleep/wake scoring 
      yields a fully automatic method for AHI-estimation. Importantly, our algorithm was 
      developed and validated on a combination of clinical datasets, including datasets 
      selectively including OSA-pathology but also a heterogeneous, "real-world" clinical 
      sleep disordered population (262 participants in the validation set). The algorithm 
      provides a good representation of the current gold standard AHI (0.72 correlation, 
      estimation error of 0.56 ± 14.74 events/h), and can also be employed as a screening 
      tool for a large range of OSA severities (ROC AUC ≥ 0.86, Cohen's kappa ≥ 0.53 and 
      precision ≥70%). The method compares favourably to other OSA monitoring strategies, 
      showing the feasibility of cardiovascular-based surrogates for sleep monitoring to 
      evolve into clinically usable tools.

TI  - Hemodialysis Procedure-Associated Autonomic Imbalance and Cardiac Arrhythmias: 
      Insights From Continuous 14-Day ECG Monitoring.

AB  - Background In patients with end-stage kidney disease, sudden cardiac death is more 
      frequent after a long interdialytic interval, within 6 hours after the end of a 
      hemodialysis session. We hypothesized that the occurrence of paroxysmal arrhythmias 
      is associated with changes in heart rate and heart rate variability in different 
      phases of hemodialysis. Methods and Results We conducted a prospective ancillary 
      study of the Predictors of Arrhythmic and Cardiovascular Risk in End Stage Renal 
      Disease cohort. Continuous ECG monitoring was performed using an ECG patch, and 
      short-term heart rate variability was measured for 3 minutes every hour (by root 
      mean square of the successive normal-to-normal intervals, spectral analysis, 
      Poincaré plot, and entropy), up to 300 hours. Out of enrolled participants (n=28; 
      age 54±13 years; 57% men; 96% black; 33% with a history of cardiovascular disease; 
      left ventricular ejection fraction 70±9%), arrhythmias were detected in 13 (46%). 
      Nonsustained ventricular tachycardia occurred more frequently 
      during/posthemodialysis than pre-/between hemodialysis (63% versus 37%, P=0.015). In 
      adjusted for cardiovascular disease time-series analysis, nonsustained ventricular 
      tachycardia was preceded by a sudden heart rate increase (by 11.2 [95% CI 10.1-12.3] 
      beats per minute; P<0.0001). During every-other-day dialysis, root mean square of 
      the successive normal-to-normal intervals had a significant circadian pattern (Mesor 
      10.6 [ 95% CI 0.9-11.2] ms; amplitude 1.5 [95% CI 1.0-3.1] ms; peak at 02:01 [95% CI 
      20:22-03:16] am; P<0.0001), which was replaced by a steady worsening on the second 
      day without dialysis (root mean square of the successive normal-to-normal intervals 
      -1.41 [95% CI -1.67 to -1.15] ms/24 h; P<0.0001). Conclusions Sudden increase in 
      heart rate during/posthemodialysis is associated with nonsustained ventricular 
      tachycardia. Every-other-day hemodialysis preserves circadian rhythm, but a second 
      day without dialysis is characterized by parasympathetic withdrawal.
