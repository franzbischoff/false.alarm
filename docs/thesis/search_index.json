Abstract Currently, Point-of-Care (POC) ECG monitoring works either as plot devices or alarms for abnormal cardiac rhythms using predefined normal trigger ranges and some rhythm analysis, which raises the problem of false alarms. In comparison, complex 12-derivation ECG machines are not suitable to use as simple monitors and are used with strict techniques for formal diagnostics. We aim to identify, on streaming data, life-threatening hearth electric patterns to reduce the number of false alarms, using low CPU and memory maintaining robustness. The study design is comparable to a diagnostic study, where high accuracy is essential. Physionets 2015 challenge yielded very good algorithms for reducing false alarms. However, none of the authors reported benchmarks, memory usage, robustness test, or context invariance that could assure its implementation on real monitors to reduce alarm fatigue indeed. We expect to identify the obstacles of detecting life-threatening ECG changes within memory, space, and CPU constraints and to reduce ECG monitors false alarms using the proposed methodology, and assess the feasibility of implementing the algorithm in the real world and other settings than ICU monitors. "],["introduction.html", "Introduction", " Introduction Currently, Point-of-Care (POC) ECG monitoring works either as plot devices or alarms for abnormal cardiac rhythms using predefined normal trigger ranges. Modern devices also incorporate algorithms to analyze arrhythmias improving their specificity. On the other hand, full 12-derivation ECG machines are complex, are not suited to use as simple monitors and are used with strict techniques for formal diagnostics of hearth electric conduction pathologies. The automatic diagnostics are derived from a complete analysis of the 12-dimension data after it is fully and well collected. Both systems do not handle disconnected leads and patients motions, being strictly necessary to have a good and stable signal to allow proper diagnosis. These interferences with the data collection frequently originate false alarms increasing both patient and staffs stress; depending on how it is measured, the rate of false alarms (overall) in ICU is estimated at 65 to 95%1. Alarm fatigue is a well-known problem that consists of a sensory overload of nurses and clinicians, resulting in desensitization to alarms and missed alarms (the crying wolf situation). Patient deaths have been attributed to alarm fatigue2. In 1982 it was recognized the increase in alarms with no end in sight; studies have demonstrated that most alarm signals have no clinical relevance and lead to clinical personnels delayed response. Ultimately patient deaths were reported related to inappropriate responses to alarms2. In April of 2013, The Joint Commission3 issued the Sentinel Event Alert4, establishing alarm system safety as a top hospital priority in the National Patient Safety Goal. Nowadays (2021), this subject still on their list, in fourth place of importance5. In February of 2015, the CinC/Physionet Challenge 2015 was about \"Reducing False Arrhythmia Alarms in the ICU6. The introduction article stated that it had been reported that up to 86% resulting of the alarms are false, and this can lead to decreased staff attention and an increase in patients delirium79. Due to this matters importance, this research aims to identify abnormal hearth electric patterns using streaming data, specifically those who are life-threatening, reducing the false alarms, being a reliable signal for Intensive Care Units to respond quickly to those situations. "],["objectives-and-the-research-question.html", "1 Objectives and the research question", " 1 Objectives and the research question This research aims to identify, on streaming data, abnormal hearth electric patterns, specifically those which are life-threatening, to be a reliable signal for Intensive Care Units to respond quickly to those situations. It also may be able to continuously analyze new data and correct itself shutting off false alarms. As it is known, this goal is not a new problem, so the main questions to solve are: (1) Can we reduce the number of false alarms in the ICU setting? (2) Can we accomplish this objective using a minimalist approach (low CPU, low memory) while maintaining robustness? (3) Can this approach be used in other health domains other than ICU or ECG? "],["related-works.html", "2 Related Works", " 2 Related Works The CinC/Physionet Challenge 2015 produced several papers aiming to reduce false alarms on their dataset. On Table it is listed the five life-threatening alarms present in their dataset. Table 2.1: Definition of the 5 alarm types used in CinC/Physionet Challenge 2015 challenge. Alarm Definition Asystole No QRS for at least 4 seconds Extreme Bradycardia Heart rate lower than 40 bpm for 5 consecutive beats Extreme Tachycardia Heart rate higher than 140 bpm for 17 consecutive beats Ventricular Tachycardia 5 or more ventricular beats with heart rate higher than 100 bpm Ventricular Flutter/Fibrillation Fibrillatory, flutter, or oscillatory waveform for at least 4 seconds They used as score the following formula, which penalizes five times the false negatives (since we do not want to miss any real event): \\[Score=\\frac{TP+TN}{TP+TN+FP+5*FN}\\] The five-best scores in this challenge are presented on Table 1014.

However, independently of their approach to this problem, none of the authors reported benchmarks, memory usage, robustness test, or context invariance that could assure its implementation on real monitors to reduce alarm fatigue indeed. There are other arrhythmias that this challenge did not assess, like atrial standstill (hyperkalemia), third-degree atrioventricular block, and others that may be life-threatening in some settings. Pulseless electrical activity is a frequent condition in cardiac arrest but cannot be identified without blood pressure information. This information is usually present in ICU settings but not in other locations.

(2) The type of algorithms used to identify ECG anomalies. (3) The type of algorithms used to identify specific diagnoses (like a flutter, hyperkalemia, and others). (4) Their performance (accuracy, ROC, etc.) A broad search will be conducted on Pubmed, Scopus, Google Scholar, device manuals, and other specific sources. Keywords: ECG AND monitoring AND ICU ECG AND[time series] ECG AND automatic AND interpretation Articles published after The PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2015: Reducing False Arrhythmia Alarms in the ICU will also be analyzed. 3.2 Research plan and methods This research is being conducted using the Research Compendium principles15: Stick with the convention of your peers; Keep data, methods, and output separated; Specify your computational environment as clearly as you can. Data management is following the FAIR principle (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable)16. Currently, the dataset used is stored on a public repository17, the source code is publicly open and stored on Github18, while the reports and reproducibility information on each step is found on a public website19. 3.2.1 Type of study This thesis will be a diagnostic study as the algorithm must classify the change in pattern as positive or negative for life-threatening. 3.2.2 The data Initially we will use the CinC/Physionet Challenge 2015 dataset that is publicly available on Physionet. This dataset is a good start for exploring the main goal of reduce false alarms. This dataset was manually selected for this challenge and the events were labeled by experts, so it is not RAW data. All signals have been resampled (using anti-alias filters) to 12 bit, 250 Hz and have had FIR bandpass [0.05 to 40Hz] and mains notch filters applied to remove noise. Pacemaker and other artifacts may be present on the ECG6. Furthermore, this dataset contains at least two ECG derivations and one or more variables like arterial blood pressure, photoplethysmograph readings, and respiration movements. These variables may or may not be helpful for increasing the sensitivity or specificity of the algorithm. It is planned to use the minimum set of variables as it is known in multi-dimensional analysis that using just two (or some small subset) of all the dimensions can be much more accurate than either using all dimensions or a single dimension20. It is desirable that real data extracted from Portuguese ICU could be used in further stage to assess the validity of the model in real settings and robustness (using RAW data instead of filtered data). The variables available on Physionets dataset are commonly available on Portuguese ICUs. 3.2.3 Workflow All steps of the process will be managed using the R package targets21 from data extraction to the final report, as shown in Fig. . The report will then be available on the main webpage19, allowing inspection of previous versions managed by the R package workflowr22, as we can see in Fig. . 3.2.4 Statistical analysis The Statistical analysis will be performed using R language v4.0.4 or greater and it will be computed the ROC curve for the algorithm. The experiment will be conducted using the Matrix Profile concept23, the state-of-the-art for time series analysis. It will be conducted several experiments to identify the best algorithm for this task. One of such algorithms is the online semantic segmentation for multi-dimensional time series20. In addition, we will combine the fading factors24,25 strategy to minimize the memory and space consumption lowering the processor power needed, allowing this algorithm to be used in almost any device. 3.2.5 Research Team Thesis Author: Francisco Bischoff Supervisor: Professor Pedro Pereira Rodrigues Co-supervisor: Professor Eamonn Keogh (UCR, Riverside) 3.3 Expected results and outcomes We expect the following results: (1) Identify the obstacles of identifying life-threatening ECG changes within memory, space, and CPU constraints. (2) Be able to reduce ECG monitors false alarms using the proposed methodology. (3) Assess the feasibility of implementing the algorithm in the real world and other settings than ICU monitors. And outcomes: (1) To achieve a better score of false alarm reduction than the best on Physionets 2015 challenge. (2) To push forward the state-of-the-art technology on false alarms reduction, maybe even being domain agnostic. (3) To draw more attention to fading factors as a reliable, fast, and cheap approximation of the true value. (4) To draw more attention to the matrix profile concept as an efficient, agnostic, and almost parameter-free way to analyze time series. (5) To draw more attention of the Patient Monitorization industry on solving the false alarm problem. "],["whatever.html", "4 Whatever", " 4 Whatever Research question and aims This research aims to identify, on streaming data, abnormal hearth electric patterns, specifically those who are life-threatening, in order to be a reliable signal for Intensive Care Units to respond quickly to those situations. It also may be able to continuously analyze new data and correct itself shutting off false alarms. Primarily an experiment will be conducted using 2 main algorithms that use Matrix Profile in detecting context changes: SDTD and FLOSS. One uses whole data training and testing, and the other uses a streaming approach that is our main interest. The goal will be detecting the transition from normal to flutter/FA to normal condition with special attention to not rely on rhythm changes. Being this successful, a more generalistic approach will be attempted: to detect changes from normal to abnormal to normal conditions, with special attention to handle with disconnected leads or patient movements. Finally, this research can prove to be a good addition to the Matrix Profile method, using fading factors in order to reduce memory and space consumption, lowering the processor power needed, allowing this algorithm to be used in almost any device.
