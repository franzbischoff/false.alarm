# Abstract

Point-of-Care (POC) ECG monitoring works either as plot devices or alarms for abnormal cardiac
rhythms using predefined normal trigger ranges. On the other hand, full 12-derivation ECG machines
are complex to use as simple monitors. They are used with strict techniques for formal diagnostics
of hearth electric conduction pathologies. The automatic diagnostics are derived from a full
analysis of the 12-dimension data after it is fully collected. Both systems do not handle
disconnected leads and patient's motions, being strictly necessary to have a good and stable signal
to allow proper diagnosis.

This research aims to identify abnormal hearth electric patterns using streaming data, specifically
those who are life-threatening, being a reliable signal for Intensive Care Units to respond quickly
to those situations.

The study design is comparable to a Diagnostic study, where high accuracy is essential. It will use
the Physionet datasets[@Clifford2015], and the algorithm will try to minimize the false negatives
and false positives.

The expected result is the concretization of a new method that, besides being accurate, accomplishes
this task using state-of-the-art technology for time series analysis that allows minimum space and
processor power to solve this problem. Also, we expect that fading factors can contribute to this
technology's state of the art.

The research team is well experienced in time-series and has studied the Matrix Profile since its
beginning, being founders of the Matrix Profile Foundation whose goal is to have a concise and
stable cross-language API for developing with the Matrix Profile
technology.[@RJ-2020-021; @VanBenschoten2020]

# Reproducible Research[@krystalli_2019]

This thesis will follow the compendium principles:

## Following Standards

Aiming to create secure materials that are [FAIR](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618) *findable, accessible,
interoperable, reusable*

### Research Data Management

-   [**RDM checklist**](http://www.dcc.ac.uk/sites/default/files/documents/resource/DMP/DMP_Checklist_2013.pdf)[@dcc_2013]
-   Anticipate **data products** as part of your thesis **outputs**
-   Think about what technologies to use

### Missing values are a fact of life

-   Usually, the best solution is to **leave blank**
-   **`NA`** or **`NULL`** are also good options
-   **NEVER use `0`**. Avoid numbers like **`-999`**
-   Don't make up your own code for missing values

### Raw data are sacrosanct

-   Don't, not even with a barge pole, not for one second, touch or otherwise edit the raw data
    files. Do manipulations in script

### Three principles for good (file) names

#### Machine readable

-   Regular expression and globbing friendly

    - Avoid spaces, punctuation, accented characters, case sensitivity

-   Easy to compute on

    - Deliberate use of delimiters

    - Deliberate use of `"-"` and `"_"` allows recovery of metadata from the filenames:

        - `"_"` underscore used to delimit units of metadata I want to access later

        - `"-"` hyphen used to delimit words, so our eyes don't bleed

#### Human readable

-   Borrowing the concept from [slugs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_URL#Slug) from semantic
    URLs

#### Play well with default ordering

-   Put something numeric first

-   Use the ISO 8601 standard for dates

-   Left pad other numbers with zeros
