\begin{abstract}
  Currently, Point-of-Care (POC) ECG monitoring works either as plot devices or alarms for abnormal
  cardiac rhythms using predefined normal trigger ranges and some rhythm analysis, which raises the
  problem of false alarms. In comparison, complex 12-derivation ECG machines are not suitable to use
  as simple monitors and are used with strict techniques for formal diagnostics. Thinking outside the
  ICU setting, where high-end devices are available for patient monitoring, we aim to identify, on
  streaming data, life-threatening hearth electric patterns using low CPU and memory, enabling ward
  monitors, home devices and even wearable devices to be able to identify such events. The study
  design is comparable to a diagnostic study, where high accuracy is essential. Physionet's 2015
  challenge yielded very good algorithms for reducing false alarms. However, none of the authors
  reported benchmarks, memory usage, robustness test, or context invariance that could assure its
  implementation on small devices. We expect to identify the obstacles of detecting life-threatening
  ECG changes within memory, space, and CPU constraints and using the proposed methods, assess the
  feasibility of implementing the algorithm in the real world and other settings than ICU monitors.

\section{Introduction (introduction topic being addressed in the project)}\label{introduction-introduction-topic-being-addressed-in-the-project}}

Currently, Point-of-Care (POC) ECG monitoring works either as plot devices or alarms for abnormal
cardiac rhythms using predefined normal trigger ranges. Modern devices also incorporate algorithms
to analyze arrhythmias improving their specificity. On the other hand, full 12-derivation ECG
machines are complex, are not suited to use as simple monitors, and are used with strict techniques
for formal diagnostics of hearth electric conduction pathologies. The automatic diagnostics are
derived from a complete analysis of the 12-dimension data after it is fully and well collected. Both
systems do not handle disconnected leads and patient's motions, being strictly necessary to have a
good and stable signal to allow proper diagnosis. These interferences with the data collection
frequently originate false alarms increasing both patient and staff's stress; depending on how it is
measured, the rate of false alarms (overall) in ICU is estimated at 65 to 95\% {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-donchin2002}{15}{]}.

Alarm fatigue is a well-known problem that consists of a sensory overload of nurses and clinicians,
resulting in desensitization to alarms and missed alarms (the ``crying wolf'' situation). Patient
deaths have been attributed to alarm fatigue {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-sendelbach2013}{34}{]}. In 1982, the increase in alarms with
``no end in sight''; studies have demonstrated that most alarm signals have no clinical relevance and
lead to clinical personnel's delayed response. Ultimately patient deaths were reported related to
inappropriate responses to alarms {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-sendelbach2013}{34}{]}.

In April of 2013, The Joint Commission {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-the_jc}{4}{]} issued the Sentinel Event Alert
{[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-JointCommission2013}{23}{]}, establishing alarm system safety as a top hospital priority in the National
Patient Safety Goal. Nowadays (2021), the subject is still on their list, in fourth place of
importance {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-the_jc2021}{5}{]}.

In February of 2015, the CinC/Physionet Challenge 2015 was about ``Reducing False Arrhythmia Alarms
in the ICU {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-Clifford2015}{12}{]}. The introduction article stated that it had been reported that up to 86\%
resulting of the alarms are false, and this can lead to decreased staff attention and an increase in
patients' delirium {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-Chambrin2001}{11}, \protect\hyperlink{ref-Lawless1994}{26}, \protect\hyperlink{ref-Parthasarathy2004}{30}{]}.

This subject draws attention to the importance of correctly identify abnormal hearth electric patterns
in order to avoid the overload of clinical staff. Meanwhile, this opens the opportunity of thinking
outside the ICU setting, where we still monitoring patients (and ourselves) using devices with
low processing power, as for example ward monitors, home devices and wearable devices.

\hypertarget{objectives-and-the-research-question-relevant-research-questions}{%
\section{Objectives and the research question (relevant research questions)}\label{objectives-and-the-research-question-relevant-research-questions}}

While this research was inspired on the CinC/Physionet Challenge 2015, its purpose is not to beat
the state of the art on that challenge, but to identify, on streaming data, abnormal hearth electric
patterns, specifically those which are life-threatening, using low CPU and low memory requirements
in order to be able to generalize the use of such information on lower-end devices, outside the ICU,
as ward devices, home devices, and wearable devices.

The main questions is: can we accomplish this objective using a minimalist approach (low CPU, low
memory) while maintaining robustness?

\hypertarget{related-works-a-brief-state-of-the-art-in-the-field}{%
\section{Related Works (a brief state of the art in the field)}\label{related-works-a-brief-state-of-the-art-in-the-field}}

Their algorithm did a pretty good job on the Physionet test set. However, independently of their approach to this
problem, none of the authors reported benchmarks, memory usage, robustness test, or context invariance that could assure
its implementation on real monitors to reduce alarm fatigue indeed.

There are other arrhythmias that this challenge did not assess, like atrial standstill (hyperkalemia), third-degree
atrioventricular block, and others that may be life-threatening in some settings. Pulseless electrical activity is a
frequent condition in cardiac arrest but cannot be identified without blood pressure information. This information is
usually present in ICU settings but not in other locations.

\hypertarget{matrixprofile}{%
\subsubsection{Matrix Profile}\label{matrixprofile}}

Matrix Profile (MP) {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-Yeh2017a}{37}{]}, is a state-of-the-art {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-DePaepe2020}{14}, \protect\hyperlink{ref-Feremans2020}{17}{]} time series
analysis technique that once computed, allows us to derive frameworks to all sorts of tasks, as
motif discovery, anomaly detection, regime change detection and others {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-Yeh2017a}{37}{]}.

Before MP, time series analysis relied on what is called \emph{distance matrix} (DM), a matrix that stores all
the distances between two time series (or itself, in case of a Self-Join). This was very power consuming,
and several methods of pruning and dimensionality reduction were researched {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-Lin2007}{27}{]}.

For brevity, let's just understand that the MP and the companion Profile Index (PI) are two vectors
that hold one floating point value and one integer value, respectively, regarding the original time
series: (1) the similarity distance between that point on time (let's call these points ``indexes'')
and its first nearest-neighbor (1-NN), (2) The index where this this 1-NN is located. The original
paper has more detailed information {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-Yeh2017a}{37}{]}. It is computed using a rolling window but instead
of creating a whole DM, only the minimum values and the index of these minimum are stored (in the
MP and PI respectively). We can have an idea of the relationship of both on Fig. \ref{fig:thematrix}.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics{../../docs/figure/mp_1} 

}

\caption{A distance matrix (top), and a matrix profile (bottom). The matrix profile stores only the minimum values of the distance matrix.}\label{fig:thematrix}
\end{figure}

This research has already yielded two R packages concerning the MP algorithms from UCR {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-mpucr}{6}{]}. The
first package is called \texttt{tsmp}, and a paper has also been published in the R Journal {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-RJ-2020-021}{10}{]}
(Journal Impact Factor™, 2020 of 3.984). The second package is called \texttt{matrixprofiler} and enhances
the first one, using low-level language to improve computational speed. The author has also joined
the Matrix Profile Foundation as co-founder together with contributors from Python and Go languages
{[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-mpf2020}{1}, \protect\hyperlink{ref-VanBenschoten2020}{35}{]}.

This implementation in R is being used for computing the MP and MP-based algorithms of this thesis.

\hypertarget{type-of-study}{%
\subsubsection{Type of study}\label{type-of-study}}

This thesis will be a diagnostic study as the algorithm must classify the change in pattern as positive or negative for
life-threatening.

\hypertarget{the-data}{%
\subsubsection{The data}\label{the-data}}

The current dataset used is the CinC/Physionet Challenge 2015 public dataset, modified to include
only the actual data and the header files in order to be read by the pipeline and is hosted by
Zenodo {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-bischoff2021}{3}{]} under the same license as Physionet.

The dataset is composed of 750 patients with at least five minutes records. All signals have been
resampled (using anti-alias filters) to 12 bit, 250 Hz and have had FIR band-pass (0.05 to 40Hz) and
mains notch filters applied to remove noise. Pacemaker and other artifacts are still present on the
ECG {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-Clifford2015}{12}{]}. Furthermore, this dataset contains at least two ECG derivations and one or more
variables like arterial blood pressure, photoplethysmograph readings, and respiration movements.

The \emph{events} we seek to identify are the life-threatening arrhythmias as defined by Physionet in
Table \ref{tab:alarms}.

\begin{table}[ht]

\caption{\label{tab:alarms}Definition of the five alarm types used in CinC/Physionet Challenge 2015.}
\centering
\begin{tabu} to \linewidth {>{\raggedright}X>{\raggedright}X}
\toprule
\textbf{Alarm} & \textbf{Definition}\\
\midrule
Asystole & No QRS for at least 4 seconds\\
\addlinespace
Extreme Bradycardia & Heart rate lower than 40 bpm for 5 consecutive beats\\
\addlinespace
Extreme Tachycardia & Heart rate higher than 140 bpm for 17 consecutive beats\\
\addlinespace
Ventricular Tachycardia & 5 or more ventricular beats with heart rate higher than 100 bpm\\
\addlinespace
Ventricular Flutter/Fibrillation & Fibrillatory, flutter, or oscillatory waveform for at least 4 seconds\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabu}
\end{table}

The fifth minute is precisely where the alarm has been triggered on the original recording set. To
meet the ANSI/AAMI EC13 Cardiac Monitor Standards {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-AAMI2002}{9}{]}, the onset of the event is within 10
seconds of the alarm (i.e., between 4:50 and 5:00 of the record). That doesn't mean that there are
no other arrhythmias before.

For comparison, on Table \ref{tab:challenge} we collected the score of the five best participants
of the challenge {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-couto2015}{13}, \protect\hyperlink{ref-fallet2015}{16}, \protect\hyperlink{ref-hoogantink2015}{21}, \protect\hyperlink{ref-kalidas2015}{24}, \protect\hyperlink{ref-plesinger2015}{31}{]}.

\begin{table}[ht]

76.11 & Sibylle Fallet, Sasan Yazdani, Jean-Marc Vesin\\
75.55 & Christoph Hoog Antink, Steffen Leonhardt\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabu}
\end{table}

The equation used on this challenge to compute the score of the algorithms is in the Equation
\eqref{eq:score}. This equation is the accuracy formula, with penalization of the false negatives.
The reasoning pointed out by the authors {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-Clifford2015}{12}{]} is the clinical impact of existing a
genuine life-threatening event that was considered unimportant. Accuracy is known to be misleading
when there is a high class imbalance {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-Akosa2017}{7}{]}.

\hfill\break

\begin{equation}
Score = \frac{TP+TN}{TP+TN+FP+5*FN}  \label{eq:score}
\end{equation}

\hfill\break

Assuming that this is a finite dataset, the pathologic cases (1) \(\lim_{TP \to \infty}\) (whenever
there is an event, it is positive) or (2) \(\lim_{TN \to \infty}\) (whenever there is an event, it is
false), cannot happen. This dataset has 292 True alarms and 458 False alarms. Experimentally, this
equation yields:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  0.24 if all guesses are on False class
\item
  0.28 if random guesses
\item
  0.39 if all guesses are on True class
\item
  0.45 if no false positives plus random on True class
\item
  0.69 if no false negatives plus random on False class
\end{itemize}

This small experiment (knowing the data in advance) shows that ``a single line of code and a few
minutes of effort'' {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-Wu2020}{36}{]} algorithm could achieve at most a score of 0.39 in this challenge (the
last two lines, the algorithm must to be very good on one class).

Nevertheless, this equation will only be useful to allow us to compare the results of this thesis
with other algorithms.

\hypertarget{proposed-approach}{%
\subsubsection{Proposed approach}\label{proposed-approach}}

The proposed approach is depicted in Fig. \ref{fig:fullmodel}. That is only a draft of the final workflow. The
algorithm for the classification of the regime changes is still to be defined. However, the main innovation resides in
the correct regime detection. Also, to achieve the goal of low CPU and memory usage, the strategy will be to combine
fading factors{[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-Gama2013}{18}, \protect\hyperlink{ref-Rodrigues2010}{33}{]} to reduce computation in online settings like in this research.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{../../docs/figure/draw-global-model} 

}

\caption{Pipeline of the final process. The streaming data, coming from one patient, is processed to create its Matrix Profile. Then, the FLOSS algorithm is computed for detecting a regime change. When a new regime is detected, a sample of this new regime is analysed by the model and a decision is made. If the new regime is life-threatening, the alarm will be fired.}\label{fig:fullmodel}
\end{figure}

\hypertarget{detecting-regime-changes}{%
\subsubsection{Detecting regime changes}\label{detecting-regime-changes}}

The regime change approach will be using the \emph{Arc Counts} concept, used on the FLUSS (Fast Low-cost
Unipotent Semantic Segmentation) algorithm, as explained by Gharghabi, \emph{et al.},{[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-gharghabi2018}{19}{]}.

The FLUSS (and FLOSS, the on-line version) algorithm is built on top of the Matrix Profile
(MP){[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-Yeh2017a}{37}{]}, described on section \ref{matrixprofile}. Recalling that the MP and the companion
Profile Index (PI) are two vectors holding information about the 1-NN. One can imagine several
``arcs'' starting from one ``index'' to another. This algorithm is based on the assumption that between
two regimes, the most similar shape (its nearest neighbor) is located on ``the same side'', so the
number of ``arcs'' decreases when there is a change on the regime, and increases again. As show on
Fig. \ref{fig:arcsoriginal}. This drop on the \emph{Arc Counts} is a signal that a change on the shape
of the signal has happened.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{../../docs/figure/fluss_arcs} 

}

\caption{FLUSS algorithm, using arc counts.}\label{fig:arcsoriginal}
\end{figure}

The choice of the FLOSS algorithm (on-line version of FLUSS) is founded on the following arguments:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Domain Agnosticism:} the algorithm makes no assumptions about the data as opposed to most
  available algorithms to date.
\item
  \textbf{Streaming:} the algorithm can provide real-time information.
\item
  \textbf{Real-World Data Suitability:} the objective is not to \emph{explain} all the data. Therefore, areas
  marked as ``don't know'' areas are acceptable.
\item
  \textbf{FLOSS is not:} a change point detection algorithm {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-aminikhanghahi2016}{8}{]}. The interest here is
  changes in the shapes of a sequence of measurements.
\end{itemize}

Other algorithms we can cite are based on Hidden Markov Models (HMM) that require at least two
parameters to be set by domain experts: cardinality and dimensionality reduction. The most
attractive alternative could be the Autoplait {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-Matsubara2014}{28}{]}, which is also domain agnostic and
parameter-free. It segments the time series using Minimum Description Length (MDL) and recursively
tests if the region is best modeled by one or two HMM. However, Autoplait is designed for batch
operation, not streaming, and also requires discrete data. FLOSS was demonstrated to be superior in
several datasets in its original paper. In addition, FLOSS is robust to several changes in data like
downsampling, bit depth reduction, baseline wandering, noise, smoothing, and even deleting 3\% of the
data and filling with simple interpolation. Finally, the most important, the algorithm is light and
suitable for low-power devices.

In the MP domain, it is worth also mentioning other possible algorithm: the Time Series Snippets
{[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-Imani2018}{22}{]}, based on MPdist {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-gharghabi2018b}{20}{]}. The latter measures the distance between two
sequences considering how many similar sub-sequences they share, no matter the order of matching. It
proved to be a useful measure (not a metric) for meaningfully clustering similar sequences. Time
Series Snippets exploits MPdist properties to summarize a dataset extracting the \(k\) sequences that
represent most of the data. The final result seems to be an alternative for detecting regime
changes, but it is not. The purpose of this algorithm is to find which pattern(s) explains most of
the dataset. Also, it is not suitable for streaming data. Lastly, MPdist is quite expensive compared
to the trivial Euclidean distance.

The regime change detection will be evaluated following the criterias explained on section
\ref{evaluation}.

\begin{figure}

\end{figure}

\hypertarget{classregime}{%
\subsubsection{Classification of the new regime}\label{classregime}}

The next step towards the objective of this work is to verify if the new regime detected by the
previous step is indeed a life-threatening pattern that we should trigger the alarm.

First let's dismiss some apparent solutions: (1) Clustering. It is well understood that we cannot
cluster time series subsequences meaningfully with any distance measure, or with any algorithm
{[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-Keogh2005}{25}{]}. The main argument is that in a meaningfull algorithm, the output depends on the input,
and this has been proven to not happen in time series subsequence clustering {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-Keogh2005}{25}{]}. (2)
Anomaly detection. In this work we are not looking for surprises, but for patterns that are known to
be life-threatening. (3) Forecasting. We may be tempted to make predictions, but clearly this is not
the idea here.

The method of choice is classification. The simplest algorithm could be a \texttt{TRUE}/\texttt{FALSE} binary
classification. Nevertheless, the five life-threatening patterns have well defined characteristics
that may seem more plausible to classify the new regime using some kind of ensamble of binary
classifiers or a ``six-class'' classifier (being the sixth class the \texttt{FALSE} class).

Since the model doesn't know which life-threatening pattern will be present in the regime (or if it
will be a \texttt{FALSE} case), the model will need to check for all five \texttt{TRUE} cases and if none of these
cases are identified, it will classify the regime as \texttt{FALSE}.

In order to avoid exceeding processor capacity, an initial set of shapelets {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-Rakthanmanon2013}{32}{]} can
be sufficient to build the \texttt{TRUE}/\texttt{FALSE} classifier. And to build such set of shapelets, leveraging
on the MP, we will use the Contrast Profile {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-Mercer2021}{29}{]}.

The Contrast Profile (CP) looks for patterns that are at the same time very \emph{similar} to its
neighbors in class \emph{A} while is very \emph{different} from the nearest neighbor from class \emph{B}. In other
words, this means that such pattern represents well class \emph{A} and may be taken as a ``signature'' of
that class.

In this case we need to compute two MP, one self-join MP using the \emph{positive} class \(MP^{(++)}\) (the
class that has the signature we want to find) and one AB-join MP using the \emph{positive} and \emph{negative}
classes \(MP^{(+-)}\). Then we subtract the first \(MP^{(++)}\) from the last \(MP^{(+-)}\), resulting in
the \(CP\). The high values on \(CP\) are the locations for the signature candidates we look for (the
author of CP calls these segments \emph{Plato's}).

Due to the nature of this approach, the MP's (containing values in Euclidean Distance) are truncated
for values above \(\sqrt{2w}\), where \(w\) is the window size. This because values above this threshold
are negatively correlated in the Pearson Correlation space. Finally, we normalize the values by
\(\sqrt{2w}\). The formula \eqref{eq:contrast} synthesizes this computation.

\hfill\break
\begin{equation}
CP_w = \frac{MP_{w}^{(+-)} - MP_{w}^{(++)}}{\sqrt{2w}} \quad \text{where}\; w \; \text{is the window size} \label{eq:contrast}
\end{equation}\\

For a more complete understanding of the process, Fig. \ref{fig:contrast} shows a practical example
from the original article {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-Mercer2021}{29}{]}.

Next, two Matrix Profiles with window size 91; AB-join is in red and self-join in blue. Bottom, the Contrast Profile showing the highest location.}\label{fig:contrast}
\end{figure}

After extracting candidates for each class signature, a classification algorithm will be fitted and
evaluated using the criterias explained on section \ref{evaluation}.

An example of candidates for ventricular tachycardia is presented on Fig. \ref{fig:vtachy}.

A side-project called ``false.alarm.io'' has been derived from this work (an unfortunate mix of
``false.alarm'' and ``PlatformIO'' {[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-PlatformIO}{2}{]}, the IDE chosen to interface the panoply of embedded
systems we can experiment with). The current results of this side-project are very enlightening and
show that the final algorithm can indeed be used in small hardware. Further data will be available

\subsection{Expected results and outcomes}\label{expected-results-and-outcomes}}

At the end, this thesis will provide a framework for identify life-threatening conditions using
biological streaming data on devices with low CPU and low memory specifications. We expect
to achieve a high quality model on identifying these pathological conditions, maintaining its
robustness in presence of noise and artifacts seen on real-world applications.
