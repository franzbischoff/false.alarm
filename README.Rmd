# Abstract

Currently, Point-of-Care (POC) ECG monitoring works either as plot devices or alarms for abnormal cardiac rhythms using
predefined normal trigger ranges and some rhythm analysis, which raises the problem of false alarms. In comparison,
complex 12-derivation ECG machines are not suitable to use as simple monitors and are used with strict techniques for
formal diagnostics. We aim to identify, on streaming data, life-threatening hearth electric patterns to reduce the
number of false alarms, using low CPU and memory maintaining robustness. The study design is comparable to a diagnostic
study, where high accuracy is essential. Physionet's 2015 challenge yielded very good algorithms for reducing false
alarms. However, none of the authors reported benchmarks, memory usage, robustness test, or context invariance that
could assure its implementation on real monitors to reduce alarm fatigue indeed. We expect to identify the obstacles of
detecting life-threatening ECG changes within memory, space, and CPU constraints and to reduce ECG monitor's false
alarms using the proposed methodology, and assess the feasibility of implementing the algorithm in the real world and
other settings than ICU monitors.

The research team is well experienced in time-series and has studied the Matrix Profile since its beginning, being
founders of the Matrix Profile Foundation whose goal is to have a concise and stable cross-language API for developing
with the Matrix Profile technology. [@Bischoff2019a; @VanBenschoten2020]

The CinC/Physionet Challenge 2015 produced several papers aiming to reduce false alarms on their dataset. On the
following table it is listed the five life-threatening alarms present in their dataset.

```{r alarms, echo=FALSE}
alarms <- tribble(
  ~Alarm, ~Definition,
  "Asystole", "No QRS for at least 4 seconds",
  "Extreme Bradycardia", "Heart rate lower than 40 bpm for 5 consecutive beats",
  "Extreme Tachycardia", "Heart rate higher than 140 bpm for 17 consecutive beats",
  "Ventricular Tachycardia", "5 or more ventricular beats with heart rate higher than 100 bpm",
  "Ventricular Flutter/Fibrillation", "Fibrillatory, flutter, or oscillatory waveform for at least 4 seconds"
)

kbl(alarms, booktabs = TRUE, caption = "Definition of the 5 alarm types used in CinC/Physionet Challenge 2015 challenge.", align = "ll") %>%

# Reproducible Research[@krystalli_2019]

This thesis will follow the compendium principles:

## Following Standards

Aiming to create secure materials that are [FAIR](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618) *findable, accessible,
interoperable, reusable*

### Research Data Management

-   [**RDM
    checklist**](http://www.dcc.ac.uk/sites/default/files/documents/resource/DMP/DMP_Checklist_2013.pdf)[@dcc_2013]
-   Anticipate **data products** as part of your thesis **outputs**
-   Think about what technologies to use

### Missing values are a fact of life

-   Usually, best solution is to **leave blank**
-   **`NA`** or **`NULL`** are also good options
-   **NEVER use `0`**. Avoid numbers like **`-999`**
-   Don't make up your own code for missing values

### Raw data are sacrosanct

-   Don't, not even with a barge pole, not for one second, touch or otherwise edit the raw data files. Do an
    manipulations in script

### Three principles for good (file) names

#### Machine readable

-   Regular expression and globbing friendly

    -   Avoid spaces, punctuation, accented characters, case sensitivity

-   Easy to compute on

    -   Deliberate use of delimiters

    -   Deliberate use of `"-"` and `"_"` allows recovery of metadata from the filenames:

        -   `"_"` underscore used to delimit units of metadata I want to access later

        -   `"-"` hyphen used to delimit words so our eyes don't bleed

#### Human readable

-   Borrowing the concept from [slugs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_URL#Slug) from semantic URLs

#### Play well with default ordering

-   Put something numeric first

-   Use the ISO 8601 standard for dates

-   Left pad other numbers with zeros
